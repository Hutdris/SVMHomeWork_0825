  <Text category="book">This is one of the best biographies I have
  ever read. You can tell the authors put a lot of time and effort
  into this work - it's a true labor of love. Filled with beautiful

  <Text category="book">I read this book many, many years ago on a
  very long flight. I couldn't put it down. The philosophy is
  simple; live frugally, save/invest money every month, and you too
  can be a millionaire. It's great advice, especially in this day
  and age when the younger generation wants the big house,
  expensive car, and everything else right NOW, with no regard to
  the future. Although some of the info is dated (Enron being named
  as a great company to invest), and some other advice (putting new
  soles on old shoes) is a bit much, the general message makes
  plenty of sense.</Text>
  <Text category="book">This book was someone else's bookclub
  selection, and I think having no expectations when I picked it up
  really helped in my having that WOW experience that some folks
  report with this book and others miss. Yes, the prose needed much
  better editing: overuse of repetition, "stock" phrases, and
  "hanging" assertions that should have been cleaned up. However, I
  found the discussions of brain development/evolution,
  similarities between certain animal behaviors and human
  behaviors, development of language in different animals, and the
  coevolution of humans and dogs to be facinating (oops, just gave
  away the ending!). I found the side discussion of outcome-based
  audits interesting and enlightening. I also liked Dr. Temple's
  recommendation that people with autism be hired for baggage
  checking positions. Great idea! Although the book really goes all
  over the place, I found it a wonderful opportunity to engage my
  "seeking/hunting" motivation (you'll have to read the book for
  that one), and worth wading through the flaws to pick up the
  nuggets of gold</Text>
  <Text category="book">I have been studing leadership for over 15
  years both by reading and experience. I consider this book to be
  the best book I have read because it describes leadership as a
  learned activity. It also says that leadership is in motivating
  people to do their own work in solving difficult problems. I
  found that as President of my congregation I was continually
  going back to the concepts in the book to lead it through a very
  difficult situation involving placement of the flags in the
  sanctuary. It was very difficult to get people to do their own
  work and not try to step in to solve everything. (That would have
  been impossible anyway) I found that he described President
  Lyndon Johnson as a successful leader (civil rights) and
  unsuccessful leader ( Vietnam). His discussion on leading without
  authority is new ground for me. If you want to discuss the book
  with others there is an on-line book study at the Work and
  Worship Institute website. I found it was a good way for me to
  get more from the book. This is a great book with great stories
  of a variety of leaders in our society.</Text>
  <Text category="book">The best book on the history of World War
  II that I've read in a long time. The title has three meanings:
  1. It can refer to the gunner at the back of a bomber. The Brits
  called these people 'Rear Gunners.' The Yanks used the term 'Tail
  Gunner.' It's the most dangerous position in the plane. 2. The
  last plane in the formation. This was more true in the American
  Combat Box than in British usage. This position is difficult to
  hold because it is at the end of a string and every move by the
  lead ship propagates irregularily through the formation. It is
  also more dangerous as enemy fighters can attack this ship more
  easily since there aren't so many guns pointing that direction.
  3. It can refer to the bombing missions near the end of the war.
  This splendid book covers all three of these meanings. In
  addition it does an excellent job of discussing the power and
  importance of air power in the defeat of Germany</Text>
  <Text category="book">*** REFERS TO CD RECORDING **** After
  picking up and putting down the book countless times I finally
  listened to this on CD. The time and attention I didn't have for
  the print version came easily for the audio recording. Guiness is
  an engaging and enthusisatic speaker in full command of his
  subject matter. He draws on foundational Christian truths,
  historic and contemporary references, anecdotes, and a solid
  business acumen. He routinely distinguishes between what
  something is and is not (eg; vocation, calling, surrender) in
  unequivocal terms. Also, he consistently makes the point that the
  main reason for our existence is to glorify God; everything else
  in his presentation simply ties-back to this truth. He explains
  how we get distracted, how others have, and how we can correct
  our path, again providing examples. And unlike the Christianity
  Lite trend in America that often promotes wealth without work or
  responsibility, Guinness is explicit about the sacrifice inherent
  in a Christian life, using for example the lives of Leonidas, St.
  Francis, and Bonhoeffer. He also speaks of the joys of a truly
  God-centered life. I recommend THE CALL to anyone who is
  listening for their own call. It will help you distinguish
  between a calling and wish-fulfillment/fantasy, acquaint you with
  others who have heard their call, and inspire you to act. If
  you've already heard and responded to your call, you'll recognize
  Guinness as a fellow traveler. This 3-hour presentation was taped
  live at Highland Park Presbyterian Church in Dallas, Tx USA. The
  recording includes 3 audience Q&amp;amp;A sessions of about 10
  minutes each. These were as informative as the main presentation,
  often reflecting the very questions I had while listening.

  <Text category="book">Zadie Smith is one of the most powerful
  authors I have read in recent times. She is so subtle about the
  race factor that we don't get to find out the races of the
  protagonists till the first 50 pages or so. She has also captured
  the emotions of Kiki and Zora perfectly (why is it that women
  always stand out in emotional moments!) and the characters stay
  with you even after you put the book down. If you enjoyed the
  movie "Crash", you will love this one</Text>
  <Text category="book">I've been very critical of the fiction work
  of John Grisham in recent years and have said many times that he
  needed to take more time to write his novels to make the stories
  more interesting. Well, he has taken time off of writing novels
  to write this interesting, if not spectacular non-fiction work of
  the trials and tribulations of Ronald Williamson, a former minor
  league baseball player implicated in a murder and sentenced to
  death row. I won't go into the details of Williamson's ordeal,
  but I will say that Grisham has written a pretty cut-and-dried
  book, that probably would have been handled better by career
  crime writers, but is still interesting nonetheless. He does a
  good job giving the details of Ron's case and what he and his
  family had to go through as events unfolded and Ron suffered from
  growing mental issues. Grisham didn't even think about writing
  Ron's story until after Ron passed away, so there are no
  interviews to draw upon, but he does a decent job of tying it all
  together. I will also say that although he is anti-death penalty,
  he doesn't hammer that opinion at you. He lets the story itself
  do the talking. I'm actually interested in how this book will
  impact the quality of Grisham's next novel, as he'll have
  actually gone almost 3 years between novels by that time.
  Hopefully the break will result in a more classic work like "The
  Firm" or "A Time to Kill", not dreck like "The King of
  Torts"</Text>

  <Text category="book">A quick search in Amazon books under the
  name "Benjamin Franklin" comes up with 2403 matches. Based upon
  that criteria, many people would say that everything that could
  be said or that needs to be said about Ben Franklin has been
  said. Those people would be emphatically wrong, as has been
  proven by author and historian H.W. Brands in his work on
  Franklin, THE FIRST AMERICAN: THE LIFE AND TIMES OF BENJAMIN
  FRANKLIN. Brands expertly brings this pivotal figure in American
  history, back to life, once more, in this book which was a
  Pulitzer finalist in 2002. This book is not only about Franklin,
  but its pages are dotted with an unbelievable cast of secondary
  characters. Brands brings the friends and acquaintances of
  Franklin to life, ranging from Cotton Mather to Sir Isaac Newton.
  The book also spans the life of Franklin from his humble
  beginnings in Boston to world acclaim as one of the pivotal
  architects of American society and government. I believe this is
  the finest biography written on Franklin since Van Doren's
  Pulitzer Prize winner of some seventy years ago. Of course, a
  book about Franklin would be incomplete without also being about
  the creation and formation of America, as the two are intricately
  attached. But Brands' work here is all inclusive, giving us not
  only the politics of Franklin, but his creative genius, business
  sense and so much more we've grown to appreciate about this
  Senior statesman in American history. I have no idea how many
  biographies I have read about Benjamin Franklin, but this is
  definitely one of the best ever. H.W. Brands has a wonderful
  writing style with flowing narrative, meticulous detail and is
  one of the few Franklin biographers who successfully point the
  reader to Franklin's human side rather than keeping the attention
  on his mythical status. Monty Rainey www.juntosociety.co</Text>
  <Text category="book">I didn't discover the delight that is the
  Artemis Fowl series until a week ago, when I read ARTEMIS FOWL in
  one day. So, of course, I had to pick up a copy of THE ARCTIC
  INCIDENT right away, to see if it was as good as the first. It
  definitely is, and in my own humble opinion, I think I liked it
  even better than the first book. There are points throughout the
  book where Artemis, now thirteen, shows a softer, more vulnerable
  side that I truly enjoyed. Don't get me wrong, he's still an evil
  genius, but he's an evil genius with heart, and you can't help
  but love him. Now that Angeline Fowl is out of her depression,
  thanks to some fairy magic from Captain Holly Short, she's sent
  Artemis back to Saint Bartelby's School for Young Gentlemen in
  Ireland. Artemis is having quite a large amount of fun flumoxing
  the school's counselor, Dr. Po, when he gets an urgent message
  from Butler, his bodyguard/butler/majordomo--it seems that
  Artemis Fowl the First is alive in Russia, being held for ransom
  by the Russian Mafiya. Young Artemis, of course, immediately sets
  out to devise a scheme to rescue his father. It's been almost two
  years since Artemis Senior was last heard from, and his son is
  most eager to bring him home. Before he can work out a devious
  scheme, though, he's visited by none other than Captain Short and
  her superior, Commander Root, and brought down to Haven City and
  into Police Plaza. It seems the goblin triad, the B'Wa Kell, have
  a human counterpart aiding in their smuggling, and Artemis the
  Second is, quite justly I believe, suspected of being that human.
  The fairies soon realize, however, that this time Artemis Fowl
  isn't the bad guy in this problem. But now they'd like Artemis
  and Butler's help in figuring out who is behind the allaince
  between the goblins and the Mud Men--and Artemis is quite willing
  to help them out, in exchange for the fairies help in rescuing
  his father. What follows is an action-packed story of good versus
  evil below ground, with deceptions, backstabbing, and revenge
  taking center stage. As Holly, Root, Butler, and Artemis race to
  save Haven City from being destroyed, some of the same characters
  from the first book make appearances--Foaly, Mulch Diggums,
  Cudgeon, and Captain Trouble. There's also a new foe in THE
  ARCTIC INCIDENT, Opal Koboi, to be dealt with. I highly recommend
  the ARTEMIS FOWL series to anyone and everyone. Highly enjoyable,
  thoroughly entertaining, and not soon forgotten.</Text>
  <Text category="book">While I am only a high school Sophmore, and
  I don't have a *real* job, this book has been very helpful in
  deciding what to shoot for doing. I've heard people call this
  book too vague, but they can't tell you exactly what to do; it
  doesn't work that way. Once you get through the personality quiz
  portion, the author gives a somewhat detailed description of your
  specific personality type (I for example am and ENFP) and throws
  in suggestions in the description and also give a modest list of
  other possibilities. I'll admit it was a bit vauger than I had
  hoped but it gives you plenty of room to move around and a great
  place to start. I'm lucky I found this book when I did (and not
  3-4 years into college) because I found some satisfying career
  options that I would not normally have chosen for myself and they
  are on the opposite end of the spectrum from what I was
  previously considering. (looking at this run-on sentence, you
  will be relieved to know that none of my choices are to be an
  English teacher) Overall, this was a good book. There was a lot
  of filler describing the different personality characteristics
  that I found redundant only because I have gone over this in
  school a couple times. However, if you are unfamiliar with this
  territory, the explanations will be quite helpful</Text>

  Also great if you're on a budget. The recipes have variations so

  <Text category="book">The NY Times Book Review linked this novel
  to the aftermath of 9-11, but that may have more to do with the
  preoccupation of New Yorkers than with the story Powers wrote.
  While he does refer to 9-11 early on, this book concerns
  environmentalism and species conservation versus wrong-headed
  economic development in the Great Plains at the western edge of
  the midwestern farming belt. It is about the struggle not to
  loose even more economic ground relative to the rest of America
  in a region that is being slowly drained of its population due to
  the changing scale of agricultural operations. But since it is a
  Richard Powers novel, it is also about much more:
  neuro-physiology, brain function as reflected in behavior and
  personality, the devotion of a 30ish sister to her less-able
  younger brother, her sexual relations with two very different
  men, and a nationally-known writer (clearly modeled on Oliver
  Sachs) who has a late mid-life crisis. It is about love,
  devotion, and doing as much of the right thing as one can do. It
  involves escape and return. Clearly, Powers should not be
  considered a regional writer. His books have been set entirely or
  partly in Brooklyn, Manhattan, Philadelphia, L. A., the Pacific
  Northwest, and the continent of Europe. But several books by
  Powers are set in the Midwest where he is based. Readers who know
  something of the areas in which those stories are set will gain
  an extra measure of appreciation for the skillful way Powers
  incorporates subtle regional characteristics into these novels.
  As others have said, this is probably not the best novel this
  writer has given us, although it is quite carefully plotted, and
  full of the marvelous insights we have come to expect from him. I
  prefer The Goldbug Variations, Three Farmers on Their Way to a
  Dance, and, despite my own musical illiteracy, In the Time of Our
  Singing. But even when Powers is not quite at his best, he writes
  a better book than most novelists ever manage ever to produce.

  <Text category="book">I must say my first reaction was to be
  surprised at how much better Hawking is at explaining modern
  physics than my college instructors were. Heisenberg's
  uncertainty principle was just an equation I learned. Hawking
  made it seem like common sense. Hawking tries a little too hard
  to be witty at times (and punctuates all of his jokes with
  exclamation points! just in case you missed them!), but
  all-in-all, this was a quite readable account of what's presently
  known about cosmology. I use the term "presently" guardedly, as
  just recently there was some big finding about dark matter (it
  exists!), but from now on, when there are new findings in
  physics, I want Hawking to explain them to me, because I feel
  like then I might understand them. That's why you should read
  this book. The reason you should not read this book is because
  you have no interest in wrestling with abstractions with which
  you will never interact in daily life, and would rather read
  about global warming or Darfur or something a bit more topical
  and practical. This was still a hard read, and I feel like I
  grasped maybe 80% of it. For you to decide, but for a former
  engineering student, this was something I wish I had read when I
  was taking physics</Text>
  <Text category="book">The journal format is a unique take on the

  good</Text>
  <Text category="book">College stoner cult following aside, Hunter
  S. Thompson's journalistic prowess was a vital national resource
  up until he left us last February. Thompson was one of those
  brave few who dared to cut through popular media perceptions and
  glittery rhetoric and travel right to the ugly center of his
  subject material, counjouring hilarious allegories where the
  average journalist would already have soiled himself in
  disillusionment. On the Campaign Trail should be required reading
  for all those who hold a less skeptical view of American politics
  than say, the average WWE heavyweight title match, for a truly
  sane person should be no more shocked to hear of a politician
  lying or cheating to increase his presidential hopes than when
  The Undertaker strikes his opponent with a steel chair when the
  referee turns his back. Hunter has long since traveled through
  this looking glass -- although he can at times be found
  expressing nostalagia for the wide-eyed optimism of the 60s --
  but the result is not nearly as depressing as it is hilarious.
  The image of Thompson infiltrating the Nixon Youth at the RNC and
  yelling obscenities and death threats at rival journalist John
  Chancellor's press box while surrounded by hundreds of kids
  chanting "Four more years!" was one of the funniest any book has
  offered me in a while. How does the cliche go -- "The more things
  change, the more they stay the same"? After the thorough spanking
  of George McGovern at the hands of Richard Nixon, HST credits the
  most staggering blow to McGovern's presidential hopes to a media
  crisis involving his vice-presidential nominee, Thomas Eagleton.
  Just days after Eagleton was named as McGovern's running mate,
  two Democratic campaign managers received phone calls revealing
  that Eagleton had gone through intensive psychiatric treatment on
  three separate occasions. As the story spread like wildfire
  throughout the press, McGovern's presidential hopes were dealt a
  blow from which they would never recover. Since then, we've seen
  Willie Horton and the Swift Boat Veterans come out to haunt their
  respective candidates, and one is inclined to wonder who the
  Democratic "mascot" will be for the 2008 race. Perhaps a mentally
  disabled child whose tricycle was crushed by the car of Hillary
  Clinton? A Dominican prostitute who gave Joe Biden the clap? But
  I digress. I give On the Campaign Trail 4 out of 5 stars because
  the book, like presidential campaigns themselves, can at times
  seem uneventful. Thompson addresses this from time to time,
  wondering aloud what it was that made him want to cover politics
  in the first place before remembering that the rush one feels
  from being a part of a winning political team is nearly identical
  to that of a junkie getting that long-needed fix. Other parts of
  the book will only make sense to the more hardcore followers of
  politics. For instance, HST's extensive interview with campaign
  manager Rick Stearns, where Stearns explains the intricacies of
  acquiring state delegates, reads like hieroglyphics to me.</Text>
  <Text category="book">Bob Quinn is definitely one of the most
  profound writers on change in this era. But his work is not for
  the faint of heart because he challenges each of us to start
  change initiatives in the place we'd least like to go -- inside
  ourselves. I found this an incredibly powerful book. I've used
  sections of it with my "change management" classes for several
  years and I know it has a tremendous impact on students, who like
  most managers have grown up unconsciously believing that change
  always needs to start with the other guy. If you want a simple
  formula for change, don't buy this book. Although it is full of
  practical, actionable ideas, "Change the World" addresses change
  at a profound level that asks readers to reflect seriously on
  what they stand for. It's a very difficult but rewarding
  assignment</Text>

  those traits do trend together. I agree that reading this book is
  an emotional experience for those former children, but that is a
  necessary part of the healing process. This book pioneered the
  idea examine this from the child's perspective, and any
  subsequent critics need to consider this. I heartily recommend
  this book for those that have been affected, and the others
  should give their copy to the library, grateful not to have

  <Text category="book">Gibbon's "Decline and Fall" is without a
  doubt one of the most well-written and truly comprehensive
  historical works concerning the Roman Empire. From the military
  maneuvers of the northern legions to the intrigues of the
  Imperial Court, Gibbon showcases the history of Rome as it
  unfolded--often relying on the eyewitness testimony of
  contemporary writers to give readers a sense of the passions and
  policies of the time. There are a few minute problems--or rather
  gaps--in Gibbon's work, but given that he originally published in
  the late 1700's we can excuse his lack of complete information.
  Overall, an excellent read and a great history of such an

  Having saw the movie years ago, I had a good idea of what the
  book was about: Two Supreme Court Justices are killed, a law
  school student, along with many other people become curious and
  try to figure out "who dun it"...only, she writes a brief and
  hits the nail on the head, and when the wrong people find out,
  she's on the run for her life! I enjoyed the book mostly because
  it was fast-paced, and had a lot of detail. So much detail and
  characters, I had a bit of a struggle to keep up! Of course it
  was suspenseful and the characters, especially of Darby, the law
  school student and the reporter who starts to help her uncover
  the truth. Good read</Text>

  <Text category="book">Ever since starting on the SIMPLE ABUNDANCE
  journey with Sarah Ban Breathnach's first book, I have longed for
  an opportunity to learn one-on-one from the Queen of simplicity
  and authenticity. We may not be able to meet Sarah face-to-face,
  but now anyone can enjoy a workshop atmosphere in the comfort of
  her own home. Women caught up in the day-to-day deluge of
  deadlines, appointments, and commitments can now curl up with a

  book to anyone who wants to savor their life instead of living in
  a blur</Text>
  <Text category="book">Tina Dirmann did a fantastic job writing
  about this difficult case, which encompasses motherhood, mental
  illness, child abuse, and matricide. Dirmann does not interject
  her own biases or agenda into her writing, rather she presents
  the many different angles of this story in a compassionate
  fashion. That, in and of itself is impressive, because many
  writers of true crime tend to lean one side or the other,get
  caught up in emotion, and appear unable to really present all
  sides of the story. Lessons can be learned from this book
  regarding mental illness and society's responsibility to help
  families who are in need of intervention. It is so sad that the
  extended families of these boys failed not only them, but also
  tragically failed their mother.</Text>

  <Text category="book">With every Grisham book I read, I get more
  and more impressed with his ability to not only use the law to
  create suspense, but to insert other elements to make this human
  as well. For once, we have a character that is not consumed by
  financial gain. However, this person has been left most of an
  eleven billion dollar fortune. However, she does not know this. A
  lawyer is sent to find her, and in the process, undergoes a
  fundamental change of his own. This story takes place in
  Washington, Maryland, West Virginia, and the rain forests along
  the Brazilian-Bolivian border. In typical Grisham fashion, he
  inserts considerable detail in all of the venues of this book,
  enabling the reader to create a mental picture everywhere this
  story goes. You can picture the six heirs that are clawing to get
  their share of the millions. You can picture the judge itching to
  have a high profile fight. You can envision the rainforest, and
  you can picture in your mind the massive changes occurring in the
  life of Nate O'Riley. This is yet another Grisham work that will
  simply stick to your fingers like glue. The pages literally turn
  themselves. Do not start this novel before going to bed, or you
  may have a sleepless night simply for the fact you simply will
  not be able to put this one down.</Text>
  <Text category="book">This book, Styron's finest, is about
  redemption. Heralded by the epigraph from John Donne, the
  intricately structured tale with its Marlowian manipulations of
  narrative points of view soon becomes so enthralling that it's
  impossible to put down. But it's also to Styron's great credit
  that the novel's theme, redemption through confrontation with
  death and violence, is reflected through its feverish style.
  There are not many books in the postwar era, and none in the
  United States, that have such a non-moralistic but intensely
  moral character and impact. Echoes of the Greek tragedians
  (several times evoked in the text) and of Dostoyevski abound.
  Finally, the crucial role by the most-fleshed out non-expatriate
  character, a philosophical Italian small-town cop named Luigi,
  elevates the moral drama to a metaphysical dimension that most
  contemporary writers don't even seem to understand, let alone
  approach. It's a shame that Styron has not received the Nobel
  Prize yet</Text>
  <Text category="book">I read the good Doctor's book Eat to Live
  and then bought China Study which he talks a lot about in this
  book. Then I bought this book being curious after reading a few
  other books on fasting and this book wins hands down though I do
  feel he's being overly cautious about doing long fasts of more
  than 5 days without medical supervision to protect himself as
  people have been doing long fasts for centuries without medical
  supervision and doing just fine and since finding a Doctor in
  even a large community is rare indeed one is left to do this on
  their own. Being a vegetarian for more than 37 years I became an
  almost 100% vegan after reading Eat to Live and have to say that
  I feel great with more energy and even started reducing
  anti-depression med I've been taking for severe depression.
  Yesterday I took my last pill! All week I've been emptying my
  refrigerator in order to start my water fast tomorow. And
  reducing my one cup of coffee in the norning to none because I
  remember clerly that awful caffiene withdrawl healache, I'm going
  to do 10 days and hoping for 14. I've done 3 day fast before and
  one 5 day and that was great. Yes, there are some flaws in both
  books and I wish the good Doctor would have made use of a good
  editor as it's not as professionally written as it could be and
  the recipes in Eat to Live are atrocious with too much canned
  foods and not healthy organic foods but I'll forgive him because
  he got me on The China Study which changed my life and his
  studies and own experience helping people get well are good and
  inspiring. Why am I going on a 10 day detox water diet? I read
  Randall Fitxgerald's One Hundred Year Lie and that was the
  catalyst that pulled it all together for me. A detox fast
  absolutely necessary after my years on earth and after too many
  years on anti-depressants I'm keeping Dr. Fuhrman's Fasting book
  close by during the next 10 hopefully 14 days for support and
  encouragement. I did make the mistake of telling my coworkers
  that I was starting a 10 day fast though the good Doctor warned
  me not to. The comments from them were typical I suppose knowing
  their health or lack of but I held my tongue. Those comments are
  just like the stupid ones some of the reviewers of Dr. Fuhnman's
  books make along with other nutrituion books. But I thinkof the
  wisest words," you are responsible for your own health" and think
  about my not being able to remember the last time I had a cold
  and the last flu I had in 1964 and smile. I don't intend to
  support the ill-begotten medical-pharmecutical industry. The last
  time I went to the Dr. I promptly firedhim after his continued to
  badger me into getting manograms. and other tests, I repeated
  that I eat well etc and he said nutrition had nothing to to do
  with breast cancer and I just walked out of his office forever.

  <Text category="book">This book gives the reader a fascinating
  and personal look inside not just the foster care system, but why
  they are very much so needed. Young Dave's life was very likely
  saved by being taken from his mother's home and placed into
  foster care. But this book makes it clear, that despite this
  positive change in is life, it certainly didn't mean everything
  was "happily ever after". Dave then struggled with issues ranging
  from not knowing some of the mere basics that other twelve years
  olds know by that age, ranging from as simple as how to take a
  proper bath to how to behave with proper manners. It also gives
  you a good look at the struggle these hard working foster homes
  and parents go through. They deal day in and day out with
  children coming from troubled homes, and these foster homes are
  in such high demand that they end up cramped to the brim. I think
  many of us, myself included, are unaware of just what a struggle
  it is for both the foster children and the foster parents, as
  well as how much we need to support these people. They are
  dedicating themselves to a truly needed and wonderful cause.
  Thanks again Dave, for having the courage to share your beautiful
  story of heartache and triumph with us</Text>
  <Text category="book">Neverwhere is one of Gaiman's best yet! I
  highly recommend this novel</Text>
  <Text category="book">I expected this to be dry and mechanical
  like lots of other math texts - too-technical proofs, homework
  questions irrelevant to the material, insufficient explanations
  for why things are the way they are. This book really surprised
  me because it wasn't "mathy" at all. It doesn't just throw proofs
  at you expecting you to wade thru page upon page of math notation
  until you understand - it gives you the intuitive side of
  important concepts, which means you only need common sense, not
  an intensive mathematical background to get everything. The
  examples they picked simplify rather than confuse the concepts.
  Each easily and naturally leads to the next. If there's anything
  not thoroughly elaborated, they were sure to cover it in the
  homework questions, by gently prodding the reader along towards
  the answer step by step instead of smacking them in the face with
  impossible problems. Homework questions supplement the material
  perfectly and basically leave you with a full and well-rounded
  impression of what the concepts mean as well as when and why to
  use them, not just how to plug numbers into some formula. If
  anything, I'd say this book errs on the side of caution in that
  in some sections it could pick up the pace a little. But then
  again, you could always just skip the easier parts</Text>

  <Text category="book">If you like math, I guarantee you'll like
  this book! The author starts out with some very nice infinite
  sums from 17th and 18th century mathematics (Newton, Leibniz, the
  Bernoullis, and Euler's Gamma function). He continues into the
  19th century with Riemann and Lebesque integrals, Weierstrass'
  pathological functions, Cantor's set theory, and winds up with
  Baire's category theorem. Reading this book is like taking a
  guided tour through Real Analysis (= calculus of one real
  variable) with the math prof you always wished you had. Its only
  prerequisite is a working knowledge of calculus; the main points
  are explained very clearly, so the reader can skip through the
  book or fill in the details, and will learn a lot, either way.
  The book is very well written, and a great pleasure to read; I

  use faecies or urine to construct art, or engage in performance

  Gray is a successful, sweet, caring, witty author that comes to

  main characters' personalities, but there is also Brianna's
  sister and brother-in-law, her mother, her friend, and Gray's
  agent. Not to mention the wonderful scenary of Ireland described
  throughout the book. The conlcusion of the book is wonderful and

  <Text category="book">I have never been a big fan of motivational
  books, because they seem so "pie in the sky" if you know what I

  different. He was right. It was easy to read and in fact I didn't
  want to put it down. But what I really liked was the "how to"
  part of the book. After all, it's no good reading about other
  people's success stories if you don't know how to make your own.
  Also, something I thought was interesting is that the author has
  a website called Success Compass which helps you set goals and
  then e-mails you a reminder several times a day. I guess the real
  key to success is not allowing yourself to forget what you want,
  and this website doesn't let you forget. Hmmmmm . . . electronic
  nagging as the key to success! ;-) Hey, whatever works</Text>
  <Text category="book">Theodore B. Taylor, the physicist who was
  the subject of this book died in 2004, but not before he had
  completed his spiritual journey from nuclear bomb maker to
  nuclear protester. Even though the text of this book originally
  appeared in "The New Yorker" in 1973, Taylor was still driven to
  publish his own works on the dangers of nuclear proliferation.
  McPhee has a very understated style ("just the facts, ma'am"),
  but this book is still the most frightening I've ever read. I
  can't decide whether I would want him to write a sequel, because
  the threat of a nuclear bomb explosion is even greater today than
  it was in 1973. Just ask yourself the following questions: Is
  there more plutonium available to terrorists in 2006 than there
  was in 1973? Yes. Do more nations have nuclear capability? Yes.
  Can a nuclear bomb be built that is even smaller and more
  efficient than its 1973 counterpart? Yes. Are the instructions
  for building a nuclear device more readily available than they
  were in 1973? Yes. Do some people hate America even more than
  they did in 1973? Decide this one for yourself. John McPhee,
  staff writer for the "New Yorker" and Pulitzer-Prize-winning
  author of twenty-seven books on subjects as various as oranges
  and the merchant marine, has written a nuclear explosion of a
  book in "The Curve of Binding Energy." It's one of those books
  that is even more relevant now than when it was written.
  Essentially, it's a blueprint of how to build a nuclear device
  using materials at hand, along with a chunk of rather easily
  stolen U-235 or plutonium. Theodore B. Taylor, himself the
  creator of smaller, more efficient nuclear bombs, tells us where
  to steal the plutonium, how to assemble a bomb, even gives hints
  on where to plant it--one of the eeriest parts of this book has
  Taylor and McPhee exploring the now-vanished towers of the World
  Trade Center, trying to pick the spot where a nuclear device
  could do the most damage. "The Curve of Binding Energy" is a must
  read for every man, jack, and paper-pusher in the Department of
  Homeland Security, not to mention both houses of Congress. I
  imagine the first reaction of many Congresspersons would be to
  ban this book, but it's way too late for that, my friend.</Text>
  <Text category="book">I bought this book after a recent trip with

  <Text category="book">These are all short stories, some very
  short; that's what he wrote. I remember reading a number of these
  (the science fiction ones mostly) in translation years ago.
  Rereading them now in the context of all his other work was
  really very interesting. As a collection of all his fictions,
  some of the items are a bit repetitive; the variations on the
  "knife fight" theme for instance. But the range of his
  imagination is fascinating, particularly in his thoughts about
  reality vs imagination and layers of reality and identity: a lot
  of it presages the information-based world of today, which
  sometimes seems to have left hard reality behind. Perhaps the
  link to the internet is one reason Borges seems to have a bit of
  a following these days among technophiles. Is not the web exactly
  Borges' "Book of Sand" - a place that absorbs us with fascinating
  and unique pages of information, but when we turn to find them
  again, we never can? And how long will it be before an imagined
  "Orbis Tertius" engulfs entities such as the wikipedia we think
  we can rely on (one might suggest it's already happened - look up
  Tatooine, for instance...) What exactly is information when it's
  just a bunch of ones and zeros - everything's already been
  written in the "Library of Babel" after all! The other
  fascinating thread to me was the influence of Arabic and Muslim
  themes; I'd never caught that before, but this collection
  includes a number of stories with an Arab perspective. Perhaps
  this is a well-known part of Spanish heritage; in any case, it
  was certainly interesting getting to know Borges through this
  collection, from the knife fights to the Arabian courts to the
  Immortals - not everything was great, but enough great stuff to

  range from this "Storage" one to "Bathrooms," "Family Houses,"
  etc... but I am giving this book a 4 because it shows alot of
  houses that seem to be beyond the means of most people that I
  know around my area. This book also likes to tell you to build
  storage in every little crack/space that does not currently have
  something useful going for it. I am giving it 4 stars, because it
  does inform you of all of the different types of devices that are
  currently (as of the book being published) available to help you
  make storage possible in nooks and crannies. It also gives you
  ideas and suggestions about how you can make more use out of the
  storage that you already have, by redesigning the shelving to
  make it more attractive also. Try not to read it all at once
  though, because I started to gloss over stuff just to get to the
  end of the book. Take it a step at a time and it will be a great
  start for you</Text>
  <Text category="book">I read an interview with Mr. Vollman, I
  think a couple years ago, I can't quote directly but he said he
  thought that prostitutes were very spiritual people. They save
  marriages, they provide comfort to the loneliest, most desperate
  among us. In practically the same breath he observed that they
  spread disease and sometimes rob their johns. That kind of
  duality is at the heart of much of Vollman's writing. On the
  surface, Whores for Gloria is one desperate, delusional man, so
  eager for even the illusion of relatedness that he attempts to
  recreate Gloria with bits and pieces of other prostitutes. It
  isn't fully clear if Gloria herself was ever real, but
  regardless, it is now a quest to fill that void collage style
  with physical samples, such as hair clippings, as well as
  emotional artifacts. The most poignant scene may be the
  protagonist hiring a prostitute, and wanting nothing more than to
  hear happy childhood memories. The prostitute complies as best
  she can but, story after story, the narratives veer into
  disturbing material. The hardest thing for the human to do is to
  hold opposite opinions about one thing at the same time. The more
  intelligent and observant one is, the more painfully aware of the
  absurdity of this task, the more painfully aware of the mental
  contortions necessary to maintain the illusion of meaning. This
  is where the magic lies in true artistc genius, such as a
  Thelonius Monk solo or, in this case, Vollman's writing. I've
  never read anything that better communicates simultaneous beauty
  and ugliness. And no better forum than gutter sex, which Vollman
  renders both repulsive and compelling. And he doesn't do it by
  being overly clever. He does it through the chaos of brute
  honesty. Whatever compositional gymnastics go into the writing,
  the end product is very readable and deceptively simple</Text>

  <Text category="book">This is a wonderful book, aimed at helping
  the struggling new mom with the all-too-often misunderstood
  Post-Partum Depression symptoms. While I am thrilled that such a
  renowned star is willing to share her story for the benefit of
  others, I urge Brooke Shields to re-consider a comment she made
  recently. She indicated that while she KNOWS now that Post-Partum
  Depression is real and requires treatment of both medicinal and
  therapy support,...she does NOT believe that ADHD exists nor that
  it requires the same level of support. It is essential that such
  public figures realize that what they HAVE experienced is not the
  ONLY form of reality. Thousands suffer with ADHD in ways that
  interfere with their livlihood, schooling, relationships and
  self-esteem issues. Studies have shown this challenge to be as
  REAL and as DEBILITATING as Post Partum Depression. So
  please,Brooke...don't deny the realities of OTHER maladies,
  simply because you haven't experienced them. You of all people
  should realize how frustrating it is to have your challenges
  blown off by others. Your "voice" is heard loudly. Your message
  must be correct. Thank you</Text>

  <Text category="book">There is little more I can contribute to
  this literary masterpiece--even though the essential structure of
  my review is clear in my mind, it will not be able to truly
  capture the magnificent splendor of this work. Gustave Flaubert
  was a conscientious literary artist who revised and perfected
  Madame Bovary with care. He worked on the novel for nearly six
  years, during which time he rewrote the manuscript several times,
  often spending days perfecting a single paragraph. The result of
  his painstaking creativity was a masterpiece that rivals the
  heavens with its beauty. Madame Bovary is a penetrating
  psychological study of its heroine, Emma Bovary, as she struggles
  to find fulfillment through a realization of her romantic
  fantasies of love and wealth. She exists in a dream world and
  longs for freedom from her middle-class humdrum lifestyle.
  Flaubert's realistic portrait of the tragic fate of this complex
  woman is nothing short of phenomenal. In perfect contrast to
  Emma, Flaubert introduces Charles Bovary, a proto-typical doctor
  who has no real talent or ambition and is content to enjoy the
  simple things that life has to offer. Soon after their wedding,
  Emma becomes disillusioned by the bumbling Charles and yearns for
  a romantic interlude. Flaubert represents the absolute
  clich&#239;&#191;&#189; of provincial life with his portrayal of
  this undemanding, unimpressive, and unnoticed middle-class man.
  Flaubert brings all facets of human personas full-circle with the
  shy, well-mannered, and well-liked young man-next-door, Leon.
  With a slow-blossoming relationship with Emma, Leon leaves for
  Paris to study law. Upon his return--and with a little
  experience--the two become lovers. Flaubert's portrayal of this
  dysfunctional couple is reminiscent of tragic romances of yore.
  Thereafter, the degeneracy of Emma's lifestyle is evident, and

  Gustave Flaubert gives us a vivid and life-like glance into the
  reality and the mannerisms and the customs of small-town people
  living in France during the mid-nineteenth-century. Flaubert's
  descriptions are detailed and beautiful--and paint a real
  portrait of the natural world he is describing. Opening with
  first-person narration that sometimes shifts to third-person has
  earned Gustave Flaubert the reputation as one of the most

  <Text category="book">This book is a very good study into what
  happen to the Lost Ten Tribes of Israel. Mr. Capt did a Great job
  in back tracking by using the clay tablets that were found in
  Assyria which list the tribes by the name which was used by the
  Assyrians which is called the House of Omri. This book is very in
  depth and very informative. I also noticed a person left one star
  because Mr. Capt did say anything about the Jews. Of course the
  Jew's wouldn't be metioned they weren't taken into exile until
  586 bce, and that was by Babylonia and not Assyria. When reading
  about the Ten Tribes people need to know that the ten tribes were
  not Jews. Over all I give five stars and it is a must have for a

  spirituality types. For each type it identifies Scripture,
  historical characters, styles of worship, and dangers. The book

  her personal spiritual personality. As with any survey tool this
  book does not go deeply enough into any particular spiritual
  practice. It doesn't need to. What it offers is an excellent
  service to the Christian community. For those who are trapped in
  a church that worships in a style predominately different from
  the their own, this book offers the knowledge that the reader is
  not alone. There are others out there that worship in the same
  way. For those who believe that all true worship looks like their
  style of worship this book offers a broader view of the Christian

  <Text category="book">Over 20 years after it was published, the
  story of the Israeli attempt to eradicate massive and repeated
  terrorist attacks emanating from the PLO (Bubba's/Jacques/UN's
  buddy Yasser) in Lebanon is no less important. Interestingly,
  Lebanon is still struggling to rid itself of Syrian occupation.
  They have gone from the vegan dictator Hafez Assad murdering
  opponents and journalists to the Syrian optometrist dictator
  murdering opponents and journalists (another killed last week
  7/2005). In this review, I will attempt to explain the story, the
  left-wing/doves reporter's views (and on so many levels his
  mistakes), and most importantly to Americans who love and support
  Israel, the correlation between Israel's actions and our "War on
  Terror." First to the journalists, the main one being the left
  wing newspaper Haraatz Ze'ev Schiff. As the brilliant reviewer
  givbatam3 points out nearby, Mr. Schiff is a member of the
  Israeli left/dove/Peace Now group. This "coalition" consists of
  myopic people (with all due respect) that don't seem to
  understand good and evil. Just as our great President Bush was
  criticized for denouncing the "Axis of Evil" (he forgot to
  mention Syria and the House of Saud), these doves conveniently
  choose to ignore the problems with cooperating with our/their
  enemies. This is what lead to the fraudulent Oslo accords and the
  creation of the terrorist supporting Palestinian Authority. It is
  this "authority" that unleashed a wave of terror on Israel
  immediately after Clinton helped the murderer Arafat receive a
  Nobel Peace Prize. Fittingly, Arafat walked away from the
  Clinton/Barak plan in 2000, which would have created a
  Palestinian state, which to this day (7.8.05) does not exist
  despite the charade of the Road Map. The authors accuse Prime
  Minister Sharon of illegally leading Israel into the war in
  Lebanon. Most of the books I've read about Israel seem to have
  been written by journalists out to discredit Sharon. He seems to
  be the Donald Rumsfeld of Israel. I don't live there so it is
  impossible for me to get a read on the situation, but he WAS
  democratically elected, so most of the voters must disagree with
  the left's assessment of Mr. Sharon (yes, I know his
  "disengagement" is an illegal abomination, more on that later.
  Wear Orange to support the settlers.) On page 39, Mr. Ze'ev
  describes Sharon as "a cynical, headstrong executor who regarded
  the IDF as his personal tool for obtaining sweeping
  achievements-and not necessarily defensive ones-and a minister
  prepared to stake the national interest on his struggle for
  power." Those would prove to be the "kindest" words he would have
  for Mr. Sharon. On page 58, he accuses Sharon of implementing a
  quasi-coup d'etat. And on and on it goes. The author also accuses
  Sharon of duping the American government, details forthcoming.
  Later on, we learn of the "courageous, freedom fighter" (my
  emphasis) Arafat's decision to deploy all Palestinians including
  12 year old boys to kill Israelis. Of course, to this day the PA
  affiliated Fatah and other groups use children to murder Israeli
  civilians (the best non-child attack recently was the Palestinian
  woman who was granted permission to receive medical care in
  Israel who tried to kill innocent Israeli doctors/nurses using
  "bomber pants." Great video of her discovering the bomb wouldn't
  activate, however US MSM {mainstream media} other than FOX
  refused to air it.) On page 92, we learn of Arafat crony and
  current PA leader Abu Mazen's (the same Oslo and Road Map
  violating, terrorist supporting/enabling, holocaust denying,
  chain-smoking Mazen that GW brazenly brought to the White House)
  recommendation to target specific ethnic types of Jews for
  murder. Throughout the story, if indeed the cabinet was mislead,
  we learn that this deception had negative military preparedness
  consequences. Specifically, a failure to call up the reserves. To
  his credit and unlike journalists Robert Fisk (Pity the Nation)
  and Thomas Friedman (NY Times, From Lebanon to Jerusalem), Mr.
  Schiff reminds us of the level of terror practiced by Ray-Ban
  Wayfarer wearing Arafat even inside his own PLO. On page 147, we
  learn of Palestinians killing Palestinians that were given the
  chance to evacuate an area prior to IDF action. In this episode,
  three children were gunned down in front of their father. On page
  149, the authors engage in a disgusting bit of analysis about the
  minds of IDF members. In discussing a particularly brutal phase
  of the operation, the author's ask "was it perhaps fueled by an
  even deeper sense of vengeance for all the harm and hatred that
  the Jews had suffered at the hands of others over the centuries?"
  And further, "How would the grandparents of these boys have
  reacted to the scene of mayhem...?" Are you kidding me?? These
  members of the citizen army were probably quite sick of repeated
  murders of innocent Israeli citizens and committed to seeing
  their country living in peace. Meanwhile, the UN, the left/doves,
  the media, and others seemed to downplay or turn a blind eye to
  Arafat's involvement in the many terrorist attacks conducted by
  the PLO prior to the Lebanon operation. In my humble view,
  something had to be done. Prime Minister Begin agreed with
  Sharon's initial plan on eliminating the terrorists in Beirut.
  Page 152 features more America bashing, culminating in an
  accusation that the US was an Israeli dupe. The story of the
  military operation is detailed completely. And no discussion of
  the Lebanon operation would be complete without mentioning the
  incidents in the refugee camps in Sabrit and Shatilla. I'll leave
  it for the reader to decide on this operation, but in short,
  Israel relied on their "allies" in Lebanon to rid the camps of
  terrorists. Most assuredly, after the Palestinians brought havoc
  to these people, they wanted revenge. The result: some civilian
  deaths to go along with the "clean up" operation and a rebuke of
  several Israeli figures including Prime Minister Sharon. Folks,
  war is not pretty and the US faced similar choices in partnering
  with the Northern Alliance in Afghanistan. Many to this day say
  that is why we allegedly "lost" Bin Laden in Tora Bora instead of
  adequately deploying our troops on the Pakistan border. General
  Tommy Franks says this would not have been possible and I believe
  him more than the Kerry/Kedwards crowd. Our "ally" Pakistan would
  not have tolerated a US presence, given that they were one of
  only three governments with relations with the Taliban. As for
  the author's attempts to rid Israeli society of Prime Minister
  Sharon, it didn't work. He forcefully fought the charges
  emanating from the investigation into the Lebanon operation.
  After Yasser walked all over Clinton in Barak in 2000 and
  launched/restarted the intifada, Israel voted for "Arik" and his
  platform of not negotiating with Arafat. Sadly, no tragically, he
  is haphazardly implementing his "disengagement plan." Six weeks
  prior to its start, it appears the plan is not well thought out
  and polls show that Israelis are increasingly against it.
  Moreover, turning land over to terrorist supporting Mazen will
  embolden those that seek Israel's destruction. Israel expects
  terror gangs of Hamas, Islamic Jihad, and Mazen's own Fatah to
  immediately set up shop in the West Bank and begin terror
  operations. So looking back Mr. Schiff and Ya'ari, who was right?
  Terror coddling doves such as Rabin (who at least acknowledged
  the danger in trusting Arafat) and Peres or Likud hawks such as
  Sharon (and Netanyahu)? Let the reader decide. I know who I would
  trust with my security: Likud members Sharon and
  Netanyahu.</Text>

  and the many pitfalls you need to avoid. This book should be read
  by everybody involved in any software project but the simplest.
  In my opinion, a standard work. Nevertheless, it needs to be
  handled with care. During ages, SW development managers have
  tried convincing their people to break out of the chaos, and plan
  their work. This book correctly warns for the opposite effects of
  believing that planning solves everything. Some people might
  however read between the lines that no planning at all is the
  best practice. The book confirms what I and my successful
  colleagues found through experience and intuition: there is an
  optimal point of planning upfront. Less harms because you don't
  know where you are going, more (too detailed) harms because it
  takes away flexibility and it slows you down significantly. New
  to me was the use of queuing theory to point out what we see
  every day: too many features, under-resourcing leads to far
  bigger delays than human mind can ever guess.</Text>
  <Text category="book">Spend big bucks and hire The Boston
  Consulting Group to help you with your strategy . . . and what do
  you get? Hardball answers that question indirectly through
  sharing classic strategies for achieving competitive and economic
  advantage employed by BCG clients. As a result, I think this book
  will be most appealing to MBAs thinking about working for BCG and
  potential clients who want to get a sense of what the outcome
  might be like. For those who are well read in business strategy,
  this book will be a disappointment. It focuses on very little you
  haven't read or thought about many times before. Skip this book
  if you are in this category. The strategies discussed include
  overwhelming competitors with superior resources (Frito-Lay
  versus Eagle Snacks), adjusting to take advantage of what
  customers want more of (more variety and better delivery from
  Wausau Papers), threatening competitors' sources of profits
  (Japanese auto makers go after the Big 3's positions in minivans
  and SUVs in North America), copy and improve on better business
  models (Batesville Casket applies automotive manufacturing
  techniques), encourage your competitor to retreat (attack the
  bottom of the market first in low margin categories and move up),
  refocus your business model on one set of advantages (CarMax),
  acquire others to build your strengths while making competitors
  more vulnerable (Masonite International), and change the nature
  of competition (get to low-cost sourcing earlier than
  competitors, secure low-cost assets sooner and play the Wal-Mart
  card carefully). The overall metaphor for the book has its
  problems. If you play to win, you are playing hardball. Al Dunlap
  (author of Mean Business) was a hardball guy, but it didn't pay
  off at Sunbeam. If I read past the words in the book, the concept
  they authors are advancing is one of being unrelenting in
  developing a strategy that creates a virtuous cycle of
  ever-expanding resources and advantages while creating a vicious
  cycle for competitors of ever-decreasing resources and
  advantages. "Keep 'Em Down" would have been a more accurate title
  for the book. You will find scant information in the book about
  newer types of strategies, new forms of technology and new
  business paradigms. This book is about "rock 'em, sock 'em"
  competition among the industrial giants of the world. I worked as
  a consultant and later as a project manager at BCG in the early
  1970s, and I was struck that the kinds of strategies and clients
  described here have changed almost not at all since then. I do
  think Hardball better captures the classic BCG approach used in
  the early 1970s than any other book I have read published by the
  firm or its professional staff. Bruce Henderson would be proud of
  you! From my perspective, I graded the book down for slight
  inaccuracies in places such as underplaying the legal risks in
  these strategies (the authors seem to think scaring off
  competitors with "signaling" is pretty risk-free), misstating
  some of the cases (did GM really crush Ford's ability to get
  investment grade bonds by pushing for zero percent financing? --
  it looks more like mutual suicide to me), and praising more than
  was due in some cases (the Japanese car companies were very late
  to come into North America with minivans and SUVs). I also
  thought the metaphor got in the way of the message . . . rather
  than enhancing it.</Text>
  <Text category="book">This book appears on most of the 'best of'
  science fiction lists that various pundits and critics have put
  out, even though it is not a very commonly known work. Does it
  deserve such a placing? I think the answer to that depends upon
  what your viewpoint is about what science fiction, as a form of
  literature, is supposed to accomplish. The idea is simple enough.
  A new drug, developed from the bacteria that causes syphilis, is
  found to have the property of greatly increasing a person's
  intelligence, but with major side effect - it kills the user in
  about nine months. The story follows one Louis Sacchetti, a
  conscientious objector to a seemingly interminable war, and who
  would already be considered to be a genius by most standards, as
  he is transferred from a standard prison to a facility specially
  constructed to see what will happen to its inmates when given
  this drug. The story is told through the means of a journal that
  Louis is encouraged, almost forced, to keep. As this idea is
  extremely similar to that of Daniel Keyes' Flowers for Algernon
  (which was later made into the movie Charly), comparison is
  invited. Flowers emphasizes the tragedy of the hero, a man who
  struggles to find those bits of knowledge that will help not just
  himself but all mankind, up against an unbeatable problem, that
  of his own retreat to sub-normal intelligence again. Camp
  Concentration follows a completely different path, that of the
  essential selfishness of the individual, of nihilism, of the
  despair of ever being able to change humanity in any meaningful
  way. The inmates that Louis initially documents are apparently
  using their greatly enhanced intelligence to investigate alchemy
  as a means of providing immortality, not for humanity in general,
  but for themselves and the 'warden' of this prison, Humphrey
  Haast. Louis, meanwhile, seems caught up in crafting new poems
  and a play, entitled 'Auswitch, A Comedy'. The title is
  indicative of something Disch does throughout this book, playing
  with names and titles to produce another layer of meaning behind
  the straightforward words, and is fairly effective in doing so.
  The tone is the primary thing here, a very dark, brooding
  atmosphere, enlivened by a very wide ranging vocabulary and many
  references, both buried and open, to other works of literature
  (most especially Dante), and scientific and psychological
  theories. Readers who are not familiar with these references may
  feel a little lost at places in this book - at least I did, as my
  breadth of knowledge in these areas is clearly more limited than
  Disch's. But from this tone, Disch develops his themes of the
  corruption of man, of his baser desires, the absolute horrors of
  what man is capable of, and where such capacity leads. As such,
  this book is almost the complete antithesis of Flowers for
  Algernon - that is, until the ending of this book. The ending of
  this book, I felt, rather drastically detracted from its overall
  message, as it doesn't seem to fit with the rest, and has a
  little of a deus-ex-machina feel to it. Given the many layered
  discourse that Disch presented in the rest of the book, which
  while sometimes difficult to follow, was certainly excellent
  writing, this ending was a disappointment. While this is
  certainly a major entry into the dystopian side of science
  fiction literature, whether it truly qualifies as a 'classic'
  will be, I'm afraid, very much a matter of opinion for a long
  time to come. But it is certainly worth reading, if for nothing
  else than to see the darker side of genius competently presented.

  <Text category="book">This book consists of 29 stand-alone
  essays, beautifully written and previously published in the "New
  England Journal of Medicine" during the early seventies. From the
  first chapter: "The viruses, instead of being single-minded
  agents of disease and death, now begin to look more like mobile
  genes...We live in a dancing matrix of viruses; they dart, rather
  like bees, from organism to organism, from plant to insect to
  mammal to me and back again, and into the sea, tugging along
  pieces of this genome, strings of genes from that, transplanting
  grafts of DNA, passing around heredity as though at a great
  party." Although there is no continuity from chapter to chapter,
  there are consistent threads of thought as the author free
  associates: 1.There is a joyful attitude about science and
  discovery and abundant tidbits about the goings on of living
  things. 2.There is constant reference to the interaction,
  symbiosis, and co-operative living arrangements amongst the
  different species. 3.There are numerous references to the
  mindless activities of ants, bees, and termites, whose activities
  create sophisticated, developed projects without any evidence of
  central control. These examples are repeatedly compared to humans
  and their social activities, with the human emphasis being on
  language. 4.The cell is the unit of life, complete with all its
  intricate inner workings. The cell membrane (cell wall in plants)
  is the protective layer that makes this unit of life possible. In
  the first chapter and frequently throughout, the author wants to
  think of the earth as a kind of organism, but he can't make it
  work - too big, too complex, too many working parts without
  visible connections. Then in the last chapter, a better analogy
  emerges. The earth is like a huge cell and the protective
  atmosphere that shields us from meteors and cosmic rays is our
  cell membrane. This fine book is a precursor to books from the
  likes of Carl Sagan, Richard Feynman, and Stephen Jay Gould.
  Reading the chapters randomly is not a bad idea - each one is
  only four to six pages long and each gives the reader plenty to
  think about. Amazingly, after 30 years, there is a little - but
  not much - in this book that is out of date. If you are a little
  rusty on biology, have your "Oxford Dictionary of Science" handy.

  <Text category="book">One Good Knight (2006) is the second
  Fantasy novel in the Tales of the Five Hundred Kingdoms series,
  following The Fairy Godmother. In the previous volume, Alexander
  and Elena organized resistance to the invasion of Fleurberg by a
  Dark Magician. After the death of the Katschei, Alexander and
  Elena were wedded, becoming Godmother and Consort. Then an Order
  of Champions was established at Glass Mountain, with Alexander as
  their Master, and Elena was given charge of Fleurberg in addition
  to her other kingdoms. In this novel, Princess Andromeda of
  Acadia is nineteen years old, but is still considered a child by
  her mother, Queen Cassiopeia, and Chief Advisor Solon Adacritus.
  She writes a report on the merchants for a trade conference and
  impresses both the Queen and the Chief Advisor. After that, her
  mother orders redecoration of the Princess wing, appoints two
  ladies to design her wardrobe and jewelry, and assigns a steward
  to handle her affairs. Andromeda is quite overwhelmed by this
  attention and augments her studies to further impress her mother.
  She notices that income from wrecked ships has grown due to an
  increase in the number and severity of storms. Her studies and
  inquiries suggest that this increase is probably due to the
  manipulations of a great wizard. She reports this matter to her
  mother. Afterward, Andromeda is resting high up in a tree within
  the palace garden when she notices a strange flying creature. As
  it comes toward her, she recognizes that it is a dragon. Then it
  reaches the palace and she observes that it is a very large
  dragon. It flames some high architectural features, grabs a
  couple of animals and flies away. The panic within the palace is
  phenomenal and the subsequent meeting of the Queen's advisors is
  very lively. Andromeda has quickly reviewed the literature on
  dragons -- consisting mainly of myths and legends -- and reports
  to the advisors that the only known method of managing a dragon
  is the sacrifice of virginal maidens. The ensuing discussion is
  even livelier, mostly concerning the means of choosing such
  sacrifices. Queen Cassiopeia states that the only fair way to
  select sacrifices is by a lottery. After the spate of crazy
  volunteers dies down, a lottery is organized. Some women find
  ways to disqualify themselves, but others are taken by the
  dragon. Rumors begin spreading that anyone who speaks out against
  the Queen is more likely to have a family member selected for the
  sacrifice. But then Andromeda is selected. This novel is mostly
  about the influence of the Tradition within the Five Hundred
  Kingdoms. Andromeda's knowledge of the Tradition comes in handy
  at various points in this quest. The Queen has sent to Glass
  Mountain for a Champion to fight the dragon, but the good knight
  doesn't come forward as expected. Someone has erected a magical
  barrier at the border to keep out such warriors. However,
  Andromeda is sort of saved by a Champion at the sacrificial site.
  Andromeda convinces the knight to take her along as a guide and
  finally proves to the Champion that she can be a help rather than
  a hindrance. They travel cross-country in the same direction that
  the dragon had flown, stopping for supplies here and there, and
  finally enter the Wyrding Lands. They encounter unicorns and a
  fox along the way before meeting the dragon and his brother. Then
  Andromeda learns that all is not as it seems. Andromeda is
  nineteen and naive. Then she is faced with one of the most
  difficult of issues: does her mother love her. While many events
  occur in this plot, this one issue is the crux of the story. Even
  her interspecies romance with the younger dragon is only a
  temporary relief from this main concern. Highly recommended for
  Lackey fans and for anyone else who enjoys tales of adventure,
  betrayal and romance. -Arthur W. Jordi</Text>

  the internet is that it allows the juxtaposition of the good, the
  bad and the ugly. Where else could one find reviews of one of the
  twentieth century's towering works that variously describe it as
  a recipe for a police state, an incitement to theft, or as
  written by someone with no understanding of philosophy (my

  <Text category="book">These are true tales from a clinical
  neurologist's notebook, but this isn't just any neurologist.
  Oliver Sacks, author of the justly celebrated, The Man Who
  Mistook His Wife for a Hat (1986) and Awakenings (1973), which
  was later made into a movie starring Robert DeNiro and Robin
  Williams, and other works, is a gifted writer with a fine sense
  of story and an even finer sense of humanity. He has a style that
  is both affecting and fascinating, yet studiously objective, a
  style laced with footnotes and clinical observations, historical
  comparisons and wisdom. Part of the power of these tales, and of
  all of Sacks's work, is his ability to be totally engaged and to
  identify with the subject while part of him is off to the side
  observing with scientific impartiality. This makes for a
  compelling read. If you've never read Sacks before, you are in
  for a very special treat. These tales are paradoxical because
  "Defects, disorders, diseases" can bring out "latent powers,
  developments, evolutions, forms of life, that might never be seen
  or even be imaginable, in their absence." It is this "'creative'
  potential, that forms the central theme of this book" (from
  Sacks's Preface, page xvi). The first tale, "The Case of the
  Colorblind Painter" is about a successful artist who worked in
  color all his life only to became colorblind at age sixty-five,
  and the effect this had on his life and work. The second, "The
  Last Hippie" is about an amnesiac man with a frontal lobe tumor
  that left him stranded in the sixties. Sacks tells this sad,
  pathetic story with vivid detail, and characteristically ends it
  with a footnote, a footnote of such warmth and genuine
  identification that we are moved to tears. (Don't skip the
  footnotes!) The third tale, "A Surgeon's Life," is an amazing
  account of a Canadian surgeon with Tourette's syndrome. It is
  here that we begin to see the central theme of this book in
  brilliant illumination. Dr. Carl Bennett, riddled with the
  bizarre tics characteristic of the disorder, compulsions that
  cause him to throw things, to touch things again and again in a
  ritualistic manner, to flail, jump and jerk about, nonetheless
  became a very successful (and beloved) doctor of surgery. Sacks
  scrubs up with Dr. Bennett and goes into surgery with him, during
  which, miraculously, the tics disappear for however long it takes
  to complete the surgery. Sacks visits him at home and meets his
  wife and two children, sees the dents in the refrigerator and on
  the walls, and comes away with a sense of how astounding the
  human potential to overcome adversity can be. The fourth tale,
  "To See and Not See," is about partially restored sight and how
  it was not a blessing. This sad story illustrates how sight is
  learned from infancy and is largely a constructive and
  interpretive function of the brain. This tale also lets us see
  how the world of the sightless can be rich and fulfilling beyond
  our imagination. In the fifth tale, "The Landscape of His Dreams,
  we meet a gifted artist, Franco Magnani, who from memory alone
  recreates his home town of Pontito, Italy through his paintings.
  He has a nearly photographic, three-dimensional memory, but
  because of a strange illness that befell him when he was
  thirty-one, he cares only to re-create his Pontito, not the
  people or events, but the houses, the masonry, the stones, and he
  does so continually with microscopic and affecting detail. The
  chapter "Prodigies," focuses on an autistic artist, Stephen
  Wiltshire, whom Sacks is determined to befriend and understand.
  In this tale, and the concluding tale, "An Anthropologist on
  Mars," Sacks helps us to penetrate the world of the autistic and
  see it (at least in my interpretation) as an alternate view of
  reality, a view with its own strengths and weaknesses, a world
  that is just as true and valid as the "normal" one. Of course
  severe autism is debilitating in the extreme, and even modest
  autism can permanently scar and alienate the autistic from
  society. Yet, perhaps that is society's loss. I even got the
  sense, in reading these concluding stories about autism, that
  perhaps theirs is an evolutionary "strategy" trying to emerge,
  that is, a different way of seeing and dealing with the world
  that also might work. I would not be shocked to discover some day
  that the autistic, with their sometimes extraordinary gifts of
  memory and concentration, are melded more completely and
  seamlessly into our usual consciousness, and that humankind is
  the better for it. Incidentally, the last tale about Temple
  Grandin, who is a professor of animal studies at Colorado State
  University, is remarkable because it is about an autistic who is
  completely integrated into the society, yet remains autistic. She
  is the one who says she sometimes feels, because of her different
  perspective, like "an anthropologist on Mars" when she views
  "normal" people. Sacks allows us to see why. Bottom line: this is
  an extraordinary book of insight and scholarship about the human
  condition, written with grace and a deep sense of humanity, not
  to be missed</Text>

  <Text category="book">In this fully illustrated and remarkably
  brief book, Hawking provides an overview of the state of
  theoretical physics at the dawn of the 21st century. The often
  dense text is supplemented by biographical details, witty asides,
  and (especially) luxuriously reproduced introductions. Hawking
  covers a lot of territory in 200 pages; he hopes to provide
  brief, non-intimidating summaries of recent concepts and new
  frontiers in science. There is astonishingly little text, and at
  times the pithiness, compactness, and occasional "cuteness" may
  work against readers' understanding; there's perhaps too much
  shell and not enough nut here. Some sections are so cursory that
  I suspect they will fail to make any sense at all to the
  untutored reader. (This is especially true of several of the
  passages on imaginary time, event horizons, and brane world
  models.) The text is aided greatly, however, by the beautifully
  rendered four-color illustrations. Even if the concepts presented
  by these drawings seem fuzzy at first, the creativity and humor
  fused into Moonrunner Design's artwork will attract, engage, and
  occasionally tease readers who might otherwise be frightened by
  the sight of a quadratic equation. Overall, then, the book might
  have far more value as a refresher course for the beginner rather
  than as an introduction for the uninitiated. Yet it's certainly
  conceivable that somebody new to this material might be intrigued
  enough to explore these subjects further. If you're looking for a
  book that will flesh out the concepts presented here, I strongly
  recommend (as does Hawking) Alan Guth's "The Inflationary
  Universe" or Brian Greene's "The Elegant Universe.</Text>
  <Text category="book">If a book makes me look forward to mid-life
  - I am all over it! This book was actually required reading for
  my course study in human development - what a find! Here, Harvard
  researcher and bestselling author, Joan Borysenko, takes the
  cycles of a woman's life and divides them into 7 year increments.
  Along the journey, she also makes a great case for debunking old
  myths about women and aging.?That's a Big 10-4, Ms. Borysenko! I
  find myself constantly at odds with the "beauty" images that the
  media gives us. I mean, come on, why 'o why are we more often
  rewarding people for how they look and less for what they
  contribute to society? Perhaps it's escapism - I tell myself (in
  effort to sleep at night). Yet, after reading Borsyenko's, book
  I'm reminded that, yes, it's good to follow intellectual
  pursuits. And, yes, there's differences between women and men.
  According to Borysenko, women are most often motivated by what
  they can contribute to society, family, and how to make a
  difference in the world. Men tend to define themselves by their
  work. Most telling! Anyhow, I won't give away the store here -
  but in my opinion, if you are of the female persuasion, you will
  not want to miss this read.</Text>
  <Text category="book">Immediately upon starting Dickens' "Our
  Mutual Friend," I was struck by parallels with Dumas' "The Count
  of Monte Cristo." Both big novels revolve around a powerful
  character who conceals his identity in a complicated plot to
  obtain social justice. The Count deals with the darker theme of
  revenge. Our Mutual Friend is an exploration of the corrupting
  influence of wealth. The novel is lively throughout, as Dickens
  displays his tremendous diversity of writing talents. The tone
  ranges from heavily ironic criticism of upper-class politics and
  antisemitism, to delicate romance, to witty visual humor. The
  characterizations are highly original; even those at the extremes
  of vice and virtue display engaging ideosyncracies. Most
  impressive to me was the consistency of Dickens' plot. Our Mutual
  Friend was written and published in installments, as was The
  Count of Monte Cristo. But Dickens keeps his story on track
  throughout, never dropping a character, while Dumas' tale is full
  of gaps and inconsistencies</Text>
  <Text category="book">I read this book several months ago, and I
  still can't shake the feeling of having read a very, very good
  book. The effect of Yourcenar's words still lingers. The text is
  an imagined valedictory letter or speech from emperor Hadrian to
  his successor. The emperor himself is dying, and faces a world
  that he is about to leave behind. He recalls his life, from being
  a young boy in his native Spain, to his ascension to the highest
  public post imaginable, that of emperor of Rome. Just as his
  professional career was incredible, so is the generosity and
  candidness of his "confession". There is seemingly no secret nook
  left untouched from his personal life. In the end, having cast
  that final weight, his conscience, from off his shoulders, the
  emperor is at last able to turn away from one world and face
  another - that of the gods.</Text>
  <Text category="book">This book is very readable because it is
  oriented to the general reader. Chapter 1 gives his short
  autobiography as to why he became an anthropologist, and his
  experiences in Kenya. A forensic pathologist is a medical doctor
  trained in pathology. A forensic anthropologist has a Ph.D. and
  studied anthropology, specializing in the human skeletal system.
  Chapter 3 tells about his laboratory, and the tools used for his
  work. Chapter 4 has many of the cases he worked on. Chapter 5
  notes that most dismemberments result from the drug trade or
  motorcycle gangs. The Interstate Highway System provides arteries
  for crimes and serial killers. (p.63). Chapter 6 discusses cases
  of suicide. Many people kill themselves without intending to. It
  is important to distinguish between murder and suicide (p.86).
  Page 87 tells why Florida has an inordinate number of suicides.
  Chapter 7 explains how forensic anthropology developed in
  response to murders. This chapter discusses some famous cases of
  this relatively young science. Page 101 tells how to distinguish
  between bone from rock by taste! Chapter 8 says bones are not
  solid and unchanging, they are constantly reshaping themselves.
  In Chapter 9 Maples tells of the use of capital punishment
  (p.128), and discusses the various methods (pp.129-131). He seems
  emotionally involved. Chapter 10 informs us about cremation.
  Chapter 11 has Maples' most difficult and most fascinating and
  perplexing case. The two dead in High Springs FL were linked to a
  shocking double murder in New Hampshire (p.152). Page Jennings'
  parents made a big, fatal mistake in sending their daughter so
  far away after her failure as a freshman (p.164). Chapter 12
  deals with the MIA in Vietnam, about 2200 compared to the 8170 in
  Korea. Hollywood movies created this popular image of captured
  men (p.187). A "delusion" (p.188)? Maples describes the US Army
  Central Identification Laboratory that identifies remains
  recovered from Vietnam. Page 202 tells what happened at the
  Executive Office Building. Chapter 13 tells of his investigation
  to recognize the skeleton of Pizarro, and correct an old mistake.
  The exhumation of President Zachary Taylor and the tests for
  arsenic poisoning are told in Chapter 14. Page 224 tells of his
  importance to those times: he backed free states in the new
  territories. His replacement changed his policies. Chapter 15 may
  be the most historically important. Maples was part of a team
  that identified the bones of Tsar Nicholas and his family. Maples
  draws political conclusions from "rotten, neglected teeth"
  (p.259). Chapter 16 tells of the murder of five college students
  over two days in Gainesville Florida. Maples identified the
  murder weapon (pp.271-273). The book concludes with the complaint
  that states are not funding forensic anthropologists, who are few
  and far between, especially in Florida (pp.278-279). Florida is
  "the most crime-ridden state in the Union". That is a political
  decision for each state government. This recalls the most
  realistic portion of "Quincy, M.E.": whenever Quincy wanted to do
  more research, his manager often said "there's no money in the
  budget"!</Text>

  <Text category="book">I expected a fabbo edge-of-the-seat read.
  What I DIDN'T expect was that this pomo thriller would provide a
  passel of top-flight management secrets to its unsuspecting
  readers. From the opening pages of the book, as Wylie Jones
  prepares to depart on a &amp;amp;quot;business trip&amp;amp;quot;
  of unspecified duration, to the penultimate chapter, when a
  revitalized Wylie and his attentive amanuensis wrap up a deal on
  the Left Coast, this beach-bag zinger is chock full with the
  sorts of advice, hints, tips, and warnings that help to build
  healthy management brains in twelve ways! Think of it as a kind
  of business allegory. Wylie's cross-country odyssey is what might
  happen if Robert Fulghum were to meet John Gardner trundling down
  the road on his reality bike, set fire to Robertson Davies'
  beard, and then move on over to the Highway Hacienda for corn
  dogs and a brew with none other than Warren Buffet, Everyone's

  <Text category="book">Definitely a wonderful book. For those
  following the teachings of the other books, this book provides
  more useful information. The path that Castaneda elucidated is
  fraught with controvery and extreme views (read the other
  reviews). I found it useful to read and judge for myself. What
  Castaneda wrote about is not fiction however it is a difficult
  path that very few ever advance upon, thus the angry reviews of
  those calling Castaneda a fraud due to their own failure. Its
  also a path that those given to fantasy and believing in their
  own 'specialness' jump on and thus follow blindly with no lasting
  gains, making up their experience as they go and making sure
  others hear about it. Definitely not a path for everyone but
  certainly open to sober verification. Also a great book for those
  looking for a well written and gripping book. I believe
  Castaneda's genius as well as his contribution to mankind is yet
  to be fully appreciated. I am grateful for the gift of his
  writings and wisdom</Text>
  <Text category="book">I enjoyed this book immensely. Remember,
  the subtitle is "MY friendship with JFK, Jr.", the book is about

  Carole Radiwill to write a book about her relationship with JFK,

  <Text category="book">I am a chemistry major and so I really like
  this book, however when I initially started o-chem, I did get a
  little intimidated by perusing through this textbook. So I
  suggest, to people who were in a similar position as me to also
  have a look at Hornback or McMurry. The text isnt an "Advanced"
  textbook perse (after a good grounding in the basics for three
  days, I found this book quite user friendly), its organization is
  completely different to most other o-chem textbooks and its
  presentation of ideas is purely mechanistic. Both of which are
  ideally good things for chemistry majors who require the
  quintessential knowledge of structure and its impact on function
  and reactivity. An examples is that when introducing orbitals,
  and orbital interaction; Greeves et al quickly go to HOMO and
  LUMO based discussions and their impact on bonding and
  antibonding. Wade and McMurry leave this, one of the most
  important principles in defining nuclephiles and electrophiles
  till later. A second example would be the appropriate structural
  implications of nucleophiles and electrophiles with respect to
  vacant orbitals, lone pairs and charge. These are the things used
  to identify em. As such, the book isnt fragmented. Each chapter
  has its specific niche topic and thereofore individuals get a
  complete understanding of various topics and their implications
  on the overall organic chemistry. Chapters are well referenced so
  if, say you are only interested in NMR then you can skip chapters
  and read only those pertaining to that subject and yet still get
  a good understanding. Most textbooks act like a stupid monologue,
  miss a passage and you'd completely miss organic chem. The
  chapter on reaction mechanisms is excellant, it actually is
  better than most primers developed in explaining this concept
  (i.e. Jacobs). However, the organization and the concentration of
  information within chapters may be daunting to individuals who
  havent had enough experience in general chemistry. Principles of
  structure and reactivity are assumed knowledge. Organic chemistry
  in most universities are taken by biology and chemistry majors.
  FOr individuals who are only doing one unit of organic chemistry;
  I would suggest you look elsewhere. A substitute (a less
  difficult but equally comprehensive textbook for people lacking
  experience in chemistry) is Hornback's which is renowned for its
  lucid mechanistic explantion of organic chemistry.</Text>

  <Text category="book">Nine months ago I was hired to help
  turnaround a once successful business. From day one I realized
  that this was a company without focus. It's one thing to define a
  problem, another to find a solution. Haneberg's book was a shot
  in the arm. Just one concept -- "Stop Multitasking" -- would have
  been a major breakthrough for my team. And, personally, the idea
  of doing "One Great Thing" has completely revitalized my approach
  to a huge job. This book immediately rose to the rank of three or
  four "must read" titles in my business library. In the couple of
  months since I first read it (and I've re-read it a couple of
  times) our department has moved far away from the reactive mode
  that drove decisions -- we're nailing deadlines, we're closing
  more sales, we're thinking more strategically across the board.
  In a business and social environment that throws more at us
  day-by-day, hour-by-hour, this book is even more important than
  it would have been just a few years ago. We're all doing more
  with less -- and this is a book that has helped me see order amid
  the chaos of conflicting priorities. If it's true, as Woody Allen
  says, that 98% of success is showing up, then the other 2% is
  knowing how to keep your eye on the ball once you get there. This
  is the manual for getting your business -- and your life -- where

  Moon, and since he is an Astrophysics student I expected that he
  would have enjoyed finding about people's conceptions about going
  to the moon at that early time. He however summed up the book by
  saying that it contained a lot of basic things didn't make much
  sense. Well, from a layman's perspective I found from the Earth
  to the Moon engaging. It goes into the technical aspects of going
  to the moon and involves a reasonable amount of logic, Physics
  and Astronomy. Even from my scientifically deprived perspective,
  a lot of things in the book didn't make much sense, such as the
  actual method of getting to the moon, but this doesn't really
  take away from the book - it adds greatly to its appeal. The book
  contained some bizarre bits of humour and its whimsical nature
  never bordered into the ridiculous. I was kept wondering how much
  of this was actually going to work, and what these poor souls
  were going to come up with next. Compared to Twenty Thousand
  Leagues Under the Sea and even Journey to the Centre of the Earth
  however, From the Earth to the Moon is noticeably less
  imaginative. Verne uses everyday objects and ideas to make his
  ideas a reality, and much unlike his other works, doesn't stray
  far from the earthly. Some people may feel cheated by the
  predictable conclusion, but all in all From the Earth to the Moon
  is a good read. If you drop at the sight of f(x) = y, then this
  book is not for you because it involves some logical thinking,
  Centripetal forces and the like which may be hard to assimilate.
  If you really know your Physics theory then you may not
  appreciate the book either because of the theoretical meanderings
  that may have limited basis today. If you, like me are somewhere
  in the middle of these two extremes then From the Earth to the
  Moon is definitely worth your time.</Text>

  Hard's what makes it great." Manager Jimmy Duggan (Tom Hanks), of

  it covers materials from elementary to early intermediate. Upon
  completion of the first grade book students can play standard
  repertoire in the early intermediate level. Students must have
  completed early elementary level before using this book because
  this book starts with playing two hands in C position. Emphasize

  <Text category="book">This is an excellent, fascinating and
  insightful read. Dr Guarneri knows her stuff and has writen this
  book well. She wrote it because obviously we need to think about
  nutrition, cholesterol and excercise, but there are deeper issues
  too like peoples emotions. She believes that heart problems can
  be caused by the stress's in our lives and our emotions - we
  could litterally die of a broken heart. Emotional events can
  weaken heart muscles. You produce stress hormones when you are
  upset which raise blood sugars and blood pressure etc which
  ultimately weaken or can destroy the heart. She talks about this
  in the book and on the flip side, talks about happy people too
  and how positive emotions and feelings do good for our hearts.
  When we are happy, our hearts beat in a coherent rythym. She says
  we have to look at our hearts in various ways. We need to look at
  it as a pump to keep us alive but to also look at the emotional
  heart, the mental heart and the spiritual heart in order to keep
  us healthy. I believe she knows her stuff and she wrote this well
  and has made it totally interesting and it's looking at our
  hearts in a different way from other books on the same subject.

  have a happy and healthy heart</Text>
  <Text category="book">First off, this book is very entertaining
  to read. Unlike many political books, it is never tedious or
  redundant. "Thieves in High Places" is an accurate portrayal of
  what is wrong with both parties in America. It is also
  informative and insightful on the roles of big Corporations in
  American politics and local economies. This book is a call to
  arms against large corporations that put locally owned businesses
  under, companies that use child labor overseas, and the entire
  Americal political system. This book empowers the common man in
  his fight for an egalitarian society, fair wages for all, and a
  real equal oppurtunity at an education. I loved this book, it was
  a pleasure to read, and confirmed everything that disuades me

  communication and how to talk to one another without fighting.
  There isnt enough things to say how AWESOME this book is. Must
  have for anyone in a bad situation. It has a questionnaire at the
  end that both partners can do and an agreement for both partners
  to read and sign. It helps lift your spirit and makes you think
  that this isnt the end of the world and that you can make it
  through. I have a new found hope for my marriage and a new

  <Text category="book">"The Great Locomotive Chase" is the stuff
  of legend. This somewhat obscure event, which commemorated the
  first anniversary of the first shots on Fort Sumter, could too
  easily be written off among Civil War devotees as a lark, a
  foolhardy distraction from the inexorable march from Shiloh to
  the Seven Days, to Second Manassas, to the three more years of
  bloodletting that were required in order to form a more perfect
  union. But first-time author Russell Bonds does a masterful job
  of taking this adventure story on its own terms, telling it well,
  and placing it in its proper context. The raid itself is a
  gripping story of intrigue, espionage, and derring-do. And if Mr.
  Bonds had only told the tale itself, this book would be well
  worth the read. But what sets this distinguished this book apart
  from so much Civil War writing is Mr. Bonds's ability to tell
  this gripping tale objectively, while putting it in its proper
  context. The author sets the table with a relatively brief yet
  thorough overview of the strategic arrangement of the war nine
  months after First Manassas. And by doing so, and by explaining
  why the Raid, coupled with the deep penetration of General Ormsby
  Mitchell into Tennessee and North Alabama, offered the fleeting
  chance to cut the Confederacy in two and thereby hasten the end
  of the war, Mr. Bonds gives the otherwise reckless
  &#239;&#191;&#189;lan of the raiders its proper place. Andrews
  and his raiders were not off on a lark, even though students of
  the era will have the natural reaction, "what were they
  thinking?" Mr. Bonds answers that question, and the answer, as
  incongruous as it may seem, reminds the reader that there was so
  much more to the Great War than the epic battles of the Armies of
  the Potomac and Northern Virginia. If the author had done nothing
  more than told the story of the Great Raid, reconciling
  contemporary accounts that were so often embellished, this would
  be a wonderful adventure story, in the great tradition of Shelby
  Foote's narrative history of the War. But this book does so much
  more. It puts the Raid in its proper strategic context, and it
  tells the story of the gallant raiders after the raid itself
  failed. This book will satisfy both the devoted Civil War critic
  and the general reader who loves a historical tale
  well-told.</Text>

  appreciation of the book is not only as a reader and enthusiast
  of language, but also as a writer; despite having been writing
  for years, and having studied numerous books on writing style and
  technique, it is "The Language Instinct" that positively impacted
  my writing more than anything else that I've read; an

  <Text category="book">`The Savory Way' is an early (1990) book
  from leading vegetarian cookbook author, Deborah Madison so, as
  Ms. Madison has a new book on the way, I thought it was high time
  for me to catch up with her body of work so I can give an
  informed review of how her new volume fits into her other books.
  Ms. Madison is a former colleague of Alice Waters and Lindsey
  Shere at Chez Panisse who specializes in a very general way, like
  Mollie Katzen and Madhur Jaffrey, on dishes that fit into a
  vegetarian lifestyle. Note that the term `vegetarian', especially
  as used by these three authors, is extremely misleading, as it is
  much more appropriate to say that they construct meals of
  everything under the sun except meat, fowl, fin fish and shell
  fish. Both Madison and Jaffrey make extensive use of milk,
  cheese, yoghurt, and eggs. Madison's objective in this book is,
  in fact, to cover as broad as possible a survey of what can be
  done without using animal flesh. The book's title may be a bit
  misleading to some foodies in that `savory' is often one of the
  words used to divide dishes in two great groups of `savory' and
  `sweet'. This book in fact includes two rather long chapters on
  sweets. A first look at this book shows lots of headnotes to the
  many recipes. The first thing you need to know if you are put off
  by `chatty' recipe books is that these notes are almost
  exclusively devoted to an understanding of the cooking involved
  with the recipe and how to get the best results from your
  ingredients. While little stories about the historical provenance
  of a recipe may interest many, including myself, that is not what
  this book is about. On top of this, I firmly agree with the
  blurbed opinion from Mollie Katzen who compliments both her
  cuisine AND her writing. Almost all professional culinary writers
  are pretty good, or have an excellent copy editor at work on
  their prose, but Ms. Madison is a food service professional who
  writes very well. I often wish the soon to be beknighted Jamie
  Oliver had a bit more talent with words, as I find his books so
  comforting in spite of the heavy contribution from his editors.
  The very first attraction of the book is its Table of Contents,
  which lists every single recipe title in the front of the book.
  This is doubly useful in that this relatively long book divides
  recipes into chapters covering eleven different types of dishes
  suitable for just about any time of the day, including a good
  selection of recipes very good for breakfast. The eleven recipe
  chapters are: Quick Bites with 40 pages of recipes for
  sandwiches, toasts, and spreads. Salads to Start or Make a Meal
  with 42 pages Soups and Stews with 50 pages of thick, thin, and
  pureed soups, including a new one with my favorite fall
  ingredient, chestnuts. Eighteen Quick Pasta Dishes for Five and
  Company, 32 pages Stovetop Vegetables, 27 pages of sautes and
  braises. Baked and Roasted Vegetables, 25 pages with ratatouille,
  gratins, tians, and other goodies. Grilled Vegetables and their
  Sauces, 11 pages with two to six sauces per grilled dish. Down to
  Earth, 26 pages on Rice, Potatoes and Beans (although beans
  appear throughout all chapters!) Morning Foods for Day and Night,
  26 pages of Eggs and Cheese and Cereals and Breads. Finishing
  Touches, 31 pages of sauces, salsas, condiments, dressings,
  pastes, and you name it. Desserts, 45 pages on Fruit Dishes,
  Cream Cheeses, Pastries, and Custards Sweetmeats, 12 pages on
  sweet pastes, peels, syrups, dried fruits, and other dessert
  dressings. Every recipe I examined is relatively simple to
  prepare with fewer expensive or rare ingredients than you may
  find with Jaffrey or Jack Bishop, and great tips on understanding
  the recipes and the ingredients. The appendix is just right for
  the occasional home cook who is lost in the forest of equipment
  you can find in a first rate kitchen supply store such as the
  second floor at Zabars. Ms. Madison puts it all in perspective by
  highlighting all my favorite tools such as gratin and tian pots,
  the mortar and pestle, a few good knives, the food mill and the
  pizza stone and peel. The chapter on the pantry has lots for the
  novice and a few good tips for the foodie, such as the fact that
  Mexican olive oils can be very spicy. Possibly the best items in
  the Appendix are the lists of dishes for special purposes such as
  entertaining, feeding large groups, and fitting into a low fat
  diet (note that for the number of recipes in this book, this low
  fat list is surprisingly short). The list of sources is short
  with no Internet sites provided, but I recognize that virtually
  all of these vendors are still in business. The bibliography is
  also brief, but hits all the right titles, especially Joy
  Larkcom's excellent `The Salad Garden'. This book is a great
  resource for `liberal' vegetarians who simply eschew meat. I
  would add this to Madhur Jaffrey's `World Vegetarian', Peter
  Berley's `The Modern Vegetarian Kitchen', and Jack Bishop's `The
  Complete Italian Vegetarian' to create a great core vegetarian
  library. I cannot at this time compare this to Ms. Madison's
  other books, as this is the first I have read, although I sense
  many of her more recent books have a narrower scope, focusing on
  vegetable dishes. I plan to review her other books in the next
  few days. Highly recommended for both vegetarians and foodies in
  general.</Text>

  <Text category="book">One of the things I like about this book

  <Text category="book">"The Case for Faith" is the weakest volume
  in a strong series. Strobel's format is fun and engaging. I find
  his books as "un-put-downable" as any blockbuster page-turner.
  Strobel holds a degree from Yale Law School, and he was an
  award-winning legal editor at the Chicago Tribune. He begins with
  a question: "Does historical evidence support the historicity of
  Jesus? Does current science support the existence of a creator
  God? Does it make sense to have faith in God?" and then travels
  North America, interviewing acknowledged, academic experts on the
  question at hand. Some rather shrill and not entirely rational
  attacks on the web protest: "But, Strobel's books aren't fair,
  because he only presents one side!" Perhaps these individuals
  missed the titles of these books, titles that appear quite
  prominently on the covers of the books. The first three words of
  each title is, "The Case for..." No, Strobel is NOT presenting
  the case *against* his topic; he doesn't represent himself as
  doing so. Our Christophobic media and academia presents that case
  relentlessly; why should Strobel waste paper and time doing that,
  when that is obviously not what he purports to be doing?
  Strobel's accounts of his interviews of the experts are always
  reader-friendly, but he never talks down to his reader. If you
  don't want to wade through the all too often alienating prose of
  too much academic writing, but want to get to the nub of the
  issue, Strobel is your man. These techniques worked excellently
  in "The Case for a Creator" and "The Case for Christ," but less
  well in "The Case for Faith." There are three remarkably strong
  episodes in the book; these episodes highlight what the rest of
  the book lacks. In the introduction, Strobel interviews Canadian
  evangelist turned atheist Charles Templeton. Templeton presents a
  righteous, enraged case *against* God, and then, tearfully,
  admits how much he continues to adore Jesus, and, indeed, to miss
  him. This wrenching passage masterfully captures the dilemma of
  many who have a love-hate relationship with their creator. In a
  few brief pages that serve as coda to Chapter One, which
  addresses the question of suffering, Strobel's friend Marc
  Harrienger talks about his own pain when his wife ran over their
  child with the family car. This very brief account is testimony
  to the power of faith, even in the face of profound suffering. In
  another brief passage, Strobel tells of his friend Ron Bronski,
  who went from being a vicious criminal to being a Christian
  minister. These highly personal passages are what I will remember
  best from this book; they were the most rewarding to read. The
  formal interviews with the experts didn't do a lot for me, and
  some were alienating. Norman Geisler's treatment of the slaughter
  of the Amalakites alienated me with its coldness and divorce from
  human concerns. It may be true that in war, children are killed
  with their adults -- when the US bombed German and Japanese
  cities during WW II we killed children as well as adults -- but
  any attempt to address such killings would have to be delivered
  with more compassion than Geisler manages to convey. Too, there
  is doubt, if not complete disbelief, among archaeologists as to
  whether these wars of conquest ever took place (see Israel
  Finkelstein.) The chapter entitled "Church History Is Littered
  with Oppression and Violence" was especially weak, compared to
  other treatments of the same material. Strobel's treatment of the
  witch trials could have been improved with insights from Lyndal
  Roper's work. Strobel doesn't handle understandings of Nazism as
  a Christian phenomenon well at all. The insistence that Nazism
  was a Christian phenomenon is revisionist and divorced from
  historical fact, and that should be made immediately clear as day
  in any discussion of the matter. Nazism was a Pagan and a
  Scientific phenomenon. The pagan swastika was to replace the
  Christian cross. Scientific approaches to what constitutes life
  worthy of life was to replace "weak" Christian ideas about
  humanity's unity as God's children and the value of all life.
  This is not made clear enough in Strobel's account. All in all, I
  have to say I've encountered better treatments of the question of
  faith in other books ... and yet, Strobel is such a good writer,
  and his technique is so engaging, that you could do worse than to
  read this book. Read the other two books in the series first,
  though.</Text>
  <Text category="book">April of 1865 has been referred to as the
  month that saved America but April of 1861 may have been just as
  vital if not more so. It was during this time that Washington DC
  sat completely surrounded by two states that were teetering on
  the verge of secession. Once Virginia did leave the Union only
  Maryland provided the federal government with a connection to the
  rest of the nation and it was a tenuous connection at best.
  Abraham Lincoln was clearly out of his league in this early stage
  of the game and he leaned heavily on General Winfield Scott. For
  his part, Scott was keenly aware of the danger facing Washington
  and began to immediately call for any militia units that could
  get to DC quickly from loyal northern states. The problem was
  that these militia units would have to travel through Maryland, a
  slave state that might well consider these Yankee troops to be
  invaders and could easily be pushed into the Confederacy by such
  an affront to state sovereignty. It was also distinctly possible
  that these militia units might be attacked by not only the people
  of Maryland but also ultimately by the state militia. In the
  meantime Virginia forces had seized the federal armory at
  Harper's Ferry and the Gosport navy yard near Hampton Virginia.
  Rumors are rampant in DC that the Virginia militia that had taken
  Harper's Ferry was preparing to move on Washington and many in
  the Federal City were in a state of panic. The questions that
  arise from this drama involve the decision making process on both
  sides and the ultimate question is of course whether Washington
  DC was ever in any real danger. Did the Confederacy in fact lose
  it's only real chance for ultimate victory during this time
  period? David Detzer has done an admirable job in this book of
  not only bringing this evolving drama to life but also of
  answering these questions in a clear and concise manner. This
  book reads much like a great historical drama and the author's
  writing style is superbly readable. It is rare for the author of
  a history book to achieve such a sense of drama since the reader
  usually already knows the outcome. Detzer has accomplished this
  however and although I was keenly aware of what was about to
  happen at every turn I had a tough time putting the book down.
  This invigorating writing style is often derisively referred to
  as popular history but Detzer blows the sides off of that old
  mold by not only offering new information but also keen
  observations that cut directly to the heart of this eventful
  period of American history. No hero of American history is spared
  criticism when criticism is due and conversely even Ben Butler is
  praised when his actions merit it. This is the story of those
  fateful days of April and May of 1861 and it is a story that is
  well told by this supremely able author. This book is well
  researched, very well written and the story is told from the
  point of view of both governments as well as the lowliest private
  in the Pennsylvania militia. It is a story upon which the fate of
  the United States once turned</Text>

  and "Grayson" families' stories. I honestly thought nothing could
  top Luke Grayson's romance with Catherine. However, Ms. Ray's
  story about Brandon and Faith was just that!! I hope the next
  book in the Grayson saga is out very soon, because again, I can
  hardly wait!! And if you have not read ALL of Francis Ray's
  novels(not just her stories about the Graysons and Falcons), get
  to reading... you will not be disappointed.</Text>
  <Text category="book">This book shows in detail how much of the
  media has gone out of its way to attack the President and how
  many facts have been distorted in the process. It also provides a
  rare look at what the President really does with his time and how
  much effort he puts into his work. If you are looking for a book
  that labels President Bush as a liar or a dummy, this is not the
  book for you. But it is a superb look at the events of the last
  year and a half, including the election of 2004. Don't be
  narrow-minded. I highly recommend it</Text>
  <Text category="book">This is one of Nora Roberts' best books
  ever! I have read everything she's written and this is now my all
  time favorite. I ADORE this book. The characters are interesting
  and very human, the plot is gripping and the background
  fascinating. Callie, an archeologist, comes to a little town in
  Maryland to set up a dig and ends up learning about her birth
  parents and reuniting with her ex-husband. What I really like
  about this is the two main characters already have a history
  before this book so its so much that they fall in love on the
  spur of the moment, like most romances (including Roberts).
  Definitely a book I highly recommend for both the romance and the
  thrilling plot. It will keep you glued to the pages until you
  figure out who the bad guys are</Text>
  <Text category="book">I actually discovered this book
  accidentally. It was in the "return to stock" section of my
  Borders Book store and I was perusing the many books people had
  been interested in. The summary caught my attention, but it was
  the first page that drew me in. Even from the beginning this book
  is captivating. It's thrilling, tragic, heart-breaking, and even
  at times so amusing. Greer has a talent for making Max seem so
  real. I couldn't stop reading it. It's so hard to put down!
  Definitely one the best books I've ever read.</Text>
  <Text category="book">So many books on the market about pregnancy
  focus on the medical aspect of what is growing in your wife's
  little belly, and not how that little thing is changing your wife
  and life forever! This book describes to a 'T' how this life
  changing event reeks havoc on everyone involved in the process,
  and it does it in a way that is bust-a-gut funny. Before I read
  this book, I was like "what the heck is wrong with my wife?"
  After reading this book, I was more like "Ohhh, I know why she
  just ripped my head off... she hates the smell of carrots!" Great
  book, fast and fun read, a must read for a new dad. I've bought
  it for every father to be, and they in turn have done the
  same.</Text>

  <Text category="book">I have read every Hiaasen novel, except
  "Flush" and "Naked Came the Manatee." I have enjoyed reading
  almost every one of them [There are exceptions -- "Basket Case"
  definitely was not up to the mark, IMHO]. The best among them, in
  my opinion, are "Strip Tease", and "Double Whammy." "Double
  Whammy" is funnier among the two. "Strip Tease" is a little more
  serious. This is one novel I read once in a while whenever I get
  the urge to laugh out loud. Those characters are crazy</Text>
  <Text category="book">This book describes the eleven-year
  psychotherapy process for a woman with sixteen different
  personalities. The analysis process took place from 1954 through
  1965. Sybil, the subject of the book, was a child of the 1920's
  and 30's, and her multiple-personality disease was a result of
  her family's genetic history and her fundamentalist, repressed,
  and abusive upbringing. Much of Sybil's struggles were due to the
  time period in which she lived--her family had mental illness but
  felt that ignoring it and focusing on other pursuits was the best
  course of action. She was so denied the exploration of her
  feelings that she choked back all symptoms of mental illness and
  tried to act normal, hindering her recovery for years. I am still
  in shock over the patience and dedication that was required to
  work with the frustratingly different personalities over a period
  of eleven years! I got frustrated at the slow and relapse-prone
  re-integration process at the end of the book, and I admire
  Schreiber for painstakingly recounting the process instead of
  using Hollywood-style short-cuts. Sybil's recovery and emergence
  as a complete, functional woman in her forties was a very
  hard-won victory. During the revealing of Sybil's personalities,
  I really liked Vicky. She was the all-seeing personality who know
  the lineage of all others. I liked her better than I liked the
  backbone-less Sybil, and I wanted her to exist for this lost
  woman. During the personality-integration process, I learned that
  all of the personalities were a part of Sybil, and such
  exaggerated emotion as Vicky's had to be integrated in to part of
  the whole Sybil. Overall, this is an amazing book that well
  stands the test of time.</Text>

  For anyone who remembers Luchows or any of the other venerable,

  <Text category="book">This book captures the human spirit, at
  both its best and its worst. Schwarz-Bart is a masterful author
  in his telling of the tale of Ernie Levy, from birth and on. He
  also, shows us the readers the cruelty of nature that was the
  Nazi movement. It is unfortunate that so many people had to
  suffer so much through history as did the Jewish people. It is
  one might say not a fair trade for normal life to be a Just Man,
  although without them humanity would crumble, as future readers
  will find out their importance. And if there really are Just Men

  fantastic description of fluid motion and derivations of the
  governing equations on a simple level.</Text>
  <Text category="book">Those who condemn this book for not being a
  long, boring list of name origins and meanings, or for stating
  that their name has gone out of style for today's children, are
  missing the point. "Baby Names Now" is a fun, readable guide to
  what people are naming their children in the early 2000s,
  including famous namesakes (saints, popes, presidents, royalty,
  music and movie stars) and what some celebrities have named their
  children. It's also fascinating to read how certain names have
  gone out of style: for example "Lisa," "Amy," "Susan" and "Dawn"
  were very popular for babies born in the 60s (and thus, my
  classmates), but are rarely used today. The book's major flaw is
  in not recognizing that parents name their children using the
  last names of people they admire, not just the first names. At
  one point, it reads "Harrison Ford...is almost certainly the
  reason for the name Harrison's popularity" - excuse me, ever hear
  of the Beatles? The entries for the name "Jordan" don't mention
  Michael Jordan, certainly a major inspiration for that name in
  this area. The entry for "Jackson" doesn't mention Michael,
  Janet, or Samuel L. The entry for "Landon" doesn't mention
  Michael. The entries for "Cassidy" don't mention David and Shaun,
  so popular in the 70s when many of today's moms were growing up.
  The entry for "Lucas" - do I have to say it, fellow Star Wars
  kids grown up and naming their children? And come on, how can you
  mention the name "Wayne" without acknowledging the popularity of
  John Wayne? Still, this is a lot of fun, and I give the authors
  credit for recognizing that "Althea" is from a Grateful Dead
  song. I look forward to the next edition</Text>
  <Text category="book">When I read Alpha Male Syndrome, I saw
  myself and the many "Alphas" I've worked with in high-tech
  corporate America. In some instances I could call out the names
  of those I'd either worked with or had family relationships or
  friendships with - based on the Alpha types, strengths and risk
  behaviors so well defined in this book. I found the practical
  tips - encouraging specific change, in those who don't seem open
  to changing - to be useful, hopeful, encouraging and sometimes
  even funny. I may go broke sending Alpha Male Syndrome to my
  too-many Alpha friends and more importantly to those who work or
  live with them! From soup to nuts I enjoyed recognizing and
  knowing myself better through the book and from taking the
  author's online Alpha Assessment - then following the Action
  Steps in the book, and updated online Alpha Tips. I can see how
  and why Ms. Ludeman and Dr. Erlandson's approach to executive
  coaching is effective.</Text>
  <Text category="book">Carlton Mellick the 3rd's "Punk Land" (a
  pseudo-sequel to his 2001 novel "Satan Burger") wastes no time in
  getting straight to the story. It is set in an alternate heaven
  for punks, where Sid Vicious is God and you are judged for entry
  not by St. Peter but rather a number of gate attendants who
  decide whether or not you are punk enough. Mellick's trademark
  off-beat humor and sideways take on religion is ever-present,
  along with a slew of philosophical ideas mixed with a juvenile
  sense of mischief. Although it is a sequel, it stands completely
  on it's own. Fans of Satan Burger will appreciate the references
  and the continued story of Nan and Mortician, but new readers
  aren't left wondering about a back story. And anyone with even a
  slight interest in punk rock or punk culture will be in well,
  punk heaven, with all the references to punk history and culture
  and appearances by icons including G.G. Allin, Henry Rollins, and
  Johnny Rotten. The book is also full of illustrations, diagrams,
  photos and lists, which help to give it a wonderful multimedia
  type feel. You'll find yourself torn between finishing the
  paragraph you're in and jumping directly over to the flier for
  the "PBR Pogo Joust" advertised on the next page. This is a great
  book, a sublimely goofy sort of work that is effortlessly good
  but never takes itself too seriously. Highly recommended for
  anyone who likes Mellick's work, but even more so for anyone who
  has never read any of his books. This is a great place to
  discover the works of a young, groundbreaking author who is only
  getting better with time</Text>

  <Text category="book">A remarkable introduction to Ezra Pound.
  Makin explains some of the underlying structures that order the
  Cantos--periplous, ideogram, fugue, the 'repeat in history'--and
  gives concise readings of individual sections that helped my
  understanding enormously. He does an especially good job of
  connecting Pound's theory of money to his views on sex and
  creativity. Makin manages to be critical of Pound while treating
  his ideas with verve and sympathy; the writing is colloquial,
  witty and jargon-free. I enjoyed the Cantos much more after
  reading this short, effective study</Text>
  <Text category="book">I'm gonna quote a paragraph from the book,
  please note - in no way can this paragraph tell you anything
  about the book or spoil it for those who havent read it. " A
  woman left at home would close her eyes and the power of her need
  would enable her to see her man on his ocean ship battling
  pirates with pistol, her man in the battle's fray with his sword
  and shield, standing victorious among corpses, her man in a
  desert whose sands were on fire, amid mountain peaks, drinking
  the driven snow. So long as he lived she would follow his
  journey, would feel his elation and his grief, and if he died a
  spear of love would fly back across the world to pierce her
  waiting omniscient heart. It would be the same for him. IN the
  midst of desert's fire he would feel her cool hand on his cheek
  and in the heat of battle she would murmur the words of love into
  his ear : live, live. That was what the stories said about love.
  That was what human beings knew love to be." Shalimar the Clown
  was about as good as I thought it would be. It definitely isn't
  the best book I've read this year but I must say Salman Rushdie's
  writing style captivates me nonetheless. In between the most
  relevant paragraphs, he says things that are unique and have a
  true stronghold on the reader's mindset. In this book, he
  mentions a quote, twice, which really caught my eye. "One doesn't
  know the questions of life until one is asked" Another thing I
  noticed about the book is that the central character, Shalimar,
  is seldom mentioned. The book seems to hover around other dozen
  characters. Only in prison and in that one letter sent back to
  Kashmira does Shalimar's true character really come out. The
  second quarter of the book got immensely boring and I really
  despise how Max's character was written about. It was annoying,
  difficult to read, over-detailed and excruciating to read. Boonyi
  was an outstanding character. So was the old witch and Boonyi's
  father. When Colonel Tortoise was mentioned in the book, I
  thought his character would prove of some consequence but nothing
  about yielded anything. One couldn't help but dislike Max's lack
  of integrity. Mythology is rather well written about in this
  book. Every 50 pages, a one page something would be mentioned
  including just the right amount of detail and words. Conclusion -
  While reading,time and again I would rage on to my friend about
  how superb the writer's grasp on the reader is. The writer knows
  his words,where to use them, he knows that he has a prodigious
  way of writing and he employed them better than ever. Maybe this
  book disappointed his core fans. Maybe it LACKED A SPARK enough
  to obilerate doubt. All in all, I can say that Salman Rushdie has
  a wierd way of his own. His vocabulary is truly astounding. Maybe
  he is the most "learned" writer I've ever read, if not the best.

  <Text category="book">I bought this book in lieu of the 2005
  Guiness Book of World Records, and I don't regret the decision at
  all. This is a huge book- 250 pages- with thousands of
  interesting and bizzare tidbits in categories such as "Amazing
  Earth", "Body and Mind", "Wonders of Science", "Fun and Games",
  and "Beyond Belief". I had never watched the Ripley's show or
  read any other Ripley's books before. The facts are just as
  fascinating as in Guiness, but they are presented in a more fun,
  colorful, and kid- friendly way. This would make a great present
  for any kid (or grown- up kid), even for those who don't read
  much. The editing isn't the greatest, and I found one fact that
  is repeated twice in two different sections (see if you can catch
  it!) but I still give it a full 5 stars! And... the cover makes
  me kind of dizzy, but that's okay. ;-</Text>

  <Text category="book">...This book is a romance, and I liked it.
  My only excuse is, it's a CLASSIC romance! I loved it, in fact.
  It's on my Top Ten Favorite Books list. It wasn't gross, it
  wasn't weird, it wasn't annoyingly romantic. I loved it. (I might
  say that a few more times.) I loved Elizabeth, Jane, Mr. Bennet's
  relations with Mrs. Bennet, Mr. Darcy, Mr. Bingly, Mr. Collins
  (my cousin cannot say his name without falling over herself
  laughing from what she saw in the movie.) I can't even find words
  to describe how much I loved this book. I read it this summer,
  and I'm still at a loss for words! All I can say is, I'll
  definitely be picking up more classics. And my book of Jane

  <Text category="book">This is a great beginner's guide to home
  buying. The advice is straightforward and the explanations are
  easy to understand. Buying a home is a scary and daunting
  prospect for me. I kept getting a lot of conflicting advice from
  relatives, friends, and coworkers on when to buy, what to buy,
  and how to buy. This is very frustrating as everyone means well,
  but what worked for them might not apply to me. And don't bother
  asking a realtor or mortgage company if you should buy--they make
  their living on our decisions to buy! So I bought Home Buying for
  Dummies to learn more, and it has a lot of sound and thoughtful
  guidance to help decide when and how much to buy... And also how
  to find a good home, and then negotiate with the realtors, the
  sellers, the mortgage companies, and everyone else that is
  sticking their hands in your wallet. The author's advice is
  realistic, and he points out the pitfalls of jumping in and what
  trouble you can get into with the different loan options out
  there</Text>
  <Text category="book">Incredibly useful! Exactly what I need all
  in one place</Text>
  <Text category="book">I am a huge John Grisham fan. I believe the
  first Grisham book I ever read was "The Pelican Brief". After
  that, I was hooked. I admit that through the years Mr. Grisham's
  work has become less "Grishamisc" and not as entertaining as
  earlier works. But, you'll have that with any author that cranks
  out as many books as he does. I first started this book by
  listening to it on CD. I soon decided that it would be more
  enjoyable to read it than listen to it. I was right! The book
  starts out with action and pulls you in. The action barely lets
  up through the entire book. This is a different kind of action.
  More mental than physical. There seems to always be something
  going on and Grisham knows how to leave you wanting more at the
  end of each chapter. One thing that is very different about this
  book than most of his works, is that there isn't really a catch
  at the end or a mystery to solve. Generally, we find Grisham
  leading us to a thriller ending. However, in this book, it is
  more of a life lesson about greed. There is no bad guy, nobody
  lurking in the shadows trying to harm the main character, etc.
  The book is about good old fashioned greed and how it can ruin
  your life. The characters are likeable and easy to follow. There
  are not too many needless chapters or boring detail that is
  irrelevant to the story. I found the book very easy to read and
  follow. I always wanted more. Although the book has a different
  theme than most Grisham books, I still really enjoyed it. It
  reminded me why I like to read his books so much. It proves he
  write good fiction without a thriller or mystery ending. If you
  like this one, try the eariler works as well. If you have seen
  the movies, it doesn't matter because the books are always better
  and usually different in some way. This book would make a good
  movie, but we'll see if anyone in Hollywood agrees with me on
  that point. Happy reading</Text>
  <Text category="book">I've always read lots of books about
  singles and how to find a mate, and that rate has sped up since
  I'm now a Romance Coach. But somehow I had missed Susan Page's
  "If I'm So Wonderful, Why am I Still Single?" even though it has
  been out since 1998, the last year I was single myself. Where
  have I been, and why hadn't I seen this book? Susan Page writes
  for "involuntary singles" -- straight, gay, male or female, each
  and every one of us who is single and wishes we weren't.
  Relentlessly positive, she starts off right to the point with "So
  why are you still single anyway?" And then, just when we've
  gotten over that shock, she states flatly:"Whatever your reasons
  are for being single, if you want to be in a relationship, no
  reason is good enough." Then Page goes about tearing apart every
  good reason we've ever come up with to keep ourselves single.
  Here's what Page takes on and turns around: Ambivalence (my
  favorite), those "Dreadful Statistics," the myth of "There are no
  good ways to meet people," and having and keeping high standards.
  Then she works on developing skills in what she calls "Frog
  kissing": Learning to say no, how to recognize true intimacy,
  avoiding "commitmentphobes," handling the intimacy gap, and
  learning to say "yes." And in the last section, "Keeping It All
  Together While You Look," Page tells you just how to do all that.
  This is easily the best, most thorough, rounded and positive book
  about relationships and dating I have seen. If you are one of
  Page's "involuntary singles," this book needs to be in your
  library. Five chocolate dipped strawberries for Susan Page! This
  is quite a book.</Text>
  <Text category="book">Dragons are certainly among the most
  quintessential elements of the fantasy genre and their likenesses
  comprise one of the cornerstones of the art associated with it.
  DragonArt: How to Draw Fantastic Dragons and Fantasy Creatures is
  both an enjoyable browse and a useful guide for anyone interested
  in creating their own dragons or other fantastic creatures with
  pencil and paper. DragonArt is divided into three major parts,
  Fantastic Dragons, Unique Details, and Other Fantasy Creatures,
  along with an introduction, a section on how to use the book, and
  a brief guide to fantastic creatures. Lessons in this book are
  progressive in nature, beginning with fundamentals and moving
  into increasingly advanced aspects of dragon design, all
  illustrated with step-by-step illustrations that are punctuated
  by helpful tips and tricks throughout. And author/artist Jessica
  "NeonDragon" Peffer has a clear, easy writing style that can be
  easily comprehended, absorbed, and acted upon, an example of
  which follows below. "Okay, so we're going to discuss the anatomy
  of a creature that exists nowhere but in our minds. Sounds kind
  of silly to say that something made from pure imagination does
  not look correct, but that will happen if your creature doesn't
  look believable. To help make your dragon as real as possible,
  base its structure on real creatures," she writes at one point
  (page 44). "The ideal dragon is likely a mix of cat, bird, and
  reptile body types. The trick is choosing which parts to keep and
  which ones to throw out. You want it to feel like a single
  creature." This advice, incidentally, is very reminiscent of that
  given by Leonardo Da Vinci in his notebooks for drawing creatures
  of this ilk, making Peffer well read or naturally very
  insightful, either of which speaks well for her. Under "How You
  Should Make an Imaginary Animal Look Natural," the increasingly
  famous Renaissance man writes, "You know that you cannot invent
  animals without limbs, each of which, in itself, must resemble
  those of some other animal. Hence if you wish to make an animal,
  imagined by you, appear natural -- let us say a Dragon, take for
  its head that of a mastiff or hound, with the eyes of a cat, the
  ears of a porcupine, the nose of a greyhound, the brow of a lion,
  the temples of an old cock, the neck of a water tortoise."
  DragonArt also includes guidelines on drawing a number of other
  sorts of fantastic creatures, including basilisks, chimeras,
  gargoyles, and griffins. For those interested in applying the
  guidelines presented in this book, a companion DragonArt Kit: How
  to Draw &amp;amp; Paint Fantastic Creatures that includes a
  compressed version of the book and some art supplies will also be
  available soon. Author Peffer is also the creator of the popular
  fantasy art Website NeonDragonArt.com, which can give anyone
  potentially interested in this book the opportunity to get a
  sense of the kinds of creatures they can learn to create
  themselves.</Text>
  <Text category="book">I chanced upon this book quite by
  accident.I am a big fan of books which inspire.This may not be a
  book which is high on the literary quotient, the writing does get
  rambling and long winded quite a number of times.But whats truly
  awe inspiring is its straight up from the heart.Its quite amazing
  that someone can go through so many emotions in a lifetime and
  actually make peace with all thats happened in a lifetime. This
  book will give you plenty to think about long after you are done
  with it</Text>

  It could be more rigorous with the math in some cases. Still it
  is such a broad and complete coverage of all important topics it
  will serve as your comm encyclopedia.</Text>
  <Text category="book">Reinventing the Bazaar used real-life
  examples to make markets understandable to any reader. From
  pharmaceutical companies to the Tokyo fish market, McMillan
  brings markets alive right in front of the readers' eyes. He
  attempts to demystify the mystery behind markets, and in my
  opinion, he succeeds. Each chapter presents a new market setting
  which McMillan uses to illustrate his various points. While the
  book has an economic undertone, the level of writing is not above
  the understanding of even a high school student. All terminology
  is explained not only with words, but with examples, as well. The
  book was enjoyable, especially if you have little familiarity
  with various market settings. However, I would encourage anyone
  to read this book because even the experts on markets will have
  their knowledge enriched by this book</Text>

  studying more than 30 titles on the craft of writing, I can say
  that this is by far the most useful work on developing believable

  are well-organized and perfectly suited to the material. The
  writer can take what he learns and put into practice immediately.

  <Text category="book">This truly excellent collection of Singer's
  stories (all originally composed in the Yiddish language) are as
  colorful as the people about whom the stories were written. Here
  are tales of weddings, of jokesters, of happy occasions of all
  variety, of feuding farmwives, and of unrepentant fools. After
  reading through a handful of Singer's works, a person gets the
  feeling of how it must have been to live as a Jew in eastern
  Europe a hundred years ago. This was a culture rich in its
  traditions and lore, a people who loved life and kept their
  identity through good times and bad. Singer, himself born and
  raised in the region so many of his short stories describe, was

  <Text category="book">I assume the plot of this famous tale is
  well known, so I won't spend time on it, but in recently
  re-reading this book for the first time since ninth-grade English
  class in the '90's, I was repeatedly struck by a piercing
  question: how exactly over time does drama become melodrama? Will
  our cherished novels seem melodramatic to readers a hundred-forty
  years hence? How does this happen, and is there ever an end-point
  to it? Dickens was by any standard a literary master, and if
  typifying one's age is a virtue, then he does this to perfection,
  yet if failing to achieve a universality unhindered by time (as
  other writers have done) is a limitation, then in this one sense
  alone Charles Dickens has an Achilles heel</Text>

  through. Be sure you understand the previous chapter before
  moving onto the next or you will most likely get lost. In the end
  I was very satisfied with my order. Listen to me...if your at

  <Text category="book">First off, I loved the book cover- spine
  and all-- one of my all time favorites. It's what first attracted
  me to this book amongst the other forward-facing covers on the
  store's front table. Then the title, I loved that just as much.
  Both share the characteristics of being straightforward, to the
  point, and revealing. Both are perfectly simple. I read most the
  essays and came to think that a. this guy really does his
  homework and b. he has a vocabulary more voluminous than the
  decimal numbers of pi. I constantly begged for my dictionary.
  It's probably what gets him the press I knew before I picked this
  up: an intellectual snob. I guess he got that from the Oprah
  incident. But I also guess that there's lots of worse name
  calling that can happen to anyone in their career. What's up with
  this culture that it's so unacceptably horrible to be labeled an
  intellectual snob and so enviously warming to be called a pop
  culture icon? The attraction to Franzen's work is that he
  investigates and reveals- in a binary way: He's researching
  facts, he's listening to feelings; he's processing both to give
  an opinion. The best example of this is My Father's Brain in
  which he relates the Alzheimer induced decomposing of his
  father's brain. There is lots about the history and science of
  memory in this essay; as much as there is about how a family
  discovers and lives with its loss. Reading it you sympathize, you
  empathize and you learn. Equally as insightful are : Lost in the
  Mail- a look into possible reasons behind Chicago's
  underperforming mail system The Reader in Exile- a great
  reflection on the intellectual and emotional fruits of reading
  First City- a historical and pensive piece about what pulls us
  towards cities Meet Me in St. Louis- a piece that shares the
  two-sided feelings in a trio of situations (including the Oprah
  incident).</Text>
  <Text category="book">this is the first piece of writing i have
  read from albert camus and i found it very interesting. the
  character meursault is a very indifferent character who seems to
  be very impartial when he hears of his mother's death and kind of
  continues to be static untill the the second half of the book. i
  do not want to give the book away as some of the others have, but
  i feel that no matter what one person does and no matter what
  ones perception is, it can never match the perception of others.
  one of my favorite lines in the story is when meursault is
  talking to the chaplain about seeking redemption through god
  because according th chaplain "it is not the human justice that
  matters but divine justice" and meursault's response was "it was
  the human justice that put me here". no matter what acts you
  commit, whether they be henous, incensitive or loving, one way or
  another you will be judged and upon that judgement will be your
  sentence. it was definitely an easy read that takes the readers
  on a ride into the thoughts of a man who accepts the one thing he
  can not change; his fate. "with this, i dont even have a chance

  the ending was a bit predictable. That said, it was still a very

  <Text category="book">Paul Johnson has written a 1,000-page book
  about various and sundry aspects of the years 1815-1830, years in
  which he rightly claims to find the origins of many aspects of
  the world as we know it today. Johnson's chosen foci are
  certainly broad: he ranges from events in politics and law to
  music, science, and even opium use. While almost every page is
  loaded with fascinating morsels of information that will
  certainly come in handy when you want to impress people at your
  next social function, Johnson's roving eye and pen can be
  disconcerting: he tends to shift topics very quickly and without
  warning. Also, while the book claims to be about "world society,"
  Johnson spends the largest part of his time talking about British
  society -- but he's found plenty of ways to range geographically
  from the "western" United States (like Kentucky) to China and
  Singapore. Throughout, his prose is generally crisp and pleasant
  to read. Overall, Johnson has given us what might be the ultimate
  in bedtime reading: a vast book that one can pick up, open nearly
  at random, and learn something interesting about the past but
  which retains significance today</Text>

  <Text category="book">Dr. Mark Albion is a consistent and
  heartfelt--seemingly lone, sometimes--voice of responsibility and
  truth in what's often a cynical, clutching corporate world. I was
  energized by his first book, "Making a Life, Making a Living
  (ML2)" and empowered by "True to Yourself." Albion builds upon
  the strengths of ML2 in his most recent title with practical,
  actionable strategies for transforming your business or career
  into one of real social value. Readers walk away with principles
  they can start executing tomorrow, and a re-calibrated moral
  compass by which to measure their progress. And Albion lives it:
  While admittedly starting out with some privilege, he bravely
  walked away from a tenured position at Harvard Business School
  (simply unheard of) to follow his heart. To this day, Albion
  continues to shun the easy money, and lives his life by the
  values he preaches. You can practically count on one hand the
  number of businesspeople out there who truly walk the talk.
  Whether it be the insatiable drive for "more," or just the
  rudimentary economics of opening the doors everyday, any business
  can very quickly shake you free from your social moorings. If you
  feel like you've lost your way, or just need some inspirational
  words ahead of that next challenge, "True to Yourself" is the
  book for you</Text>

  <Text category="book">This is an essential read for anyone who
  wants a deeper understand of American foreign policy. A year
  after this book was published, there were over a hundred reviews.
  Regardless of whiether one disagrees or agrees with the author,
  finds the author right or wrong, interesting or boring, this book
  is one of the most influential books, if not the most influential
  book that affected American foreign policy. In fact, the current
  Bush Adminstration's policies, George Kenan's containment, Henry
  Kissinger's policies as well as countless adminstration's
  policies are shaped or affected by this book. My area of study is
  the foreign policy of Post World War Two American governments,
  and never have I understood it with greater clarity after I read
  this book. It is the thread which runs through the policies of
  all the administrations, differing on extent. (I studied the
  policies first and read the book the year after). It is a
  fascinating book and hard to put down. The author writes in a
  European style (beautiful long sentences,etc.), which in my
  opinion makes it more eloquent and in the opinion of my
  co-students makes it more difficut to read. He tries to give a
  balanced perspective from which one can think critically. Ms.
  Rice and Mr. Kissinger were heavily influenced by this book. To
  understand them, this is a must read. In and of itself, it is an
  excellent book, a classic, and thousands others significantly
  more qualified than I have reviewed it. Look even at other
  reviews on this website or at well known journals for a more
  accurate assement of the book itself by political

  <Text category="book">When one begins to despair about the
  quality (or lack thereof) of the modern novel you come across a
  gem which dispels that despair for the time being. Not only is
  this one a gem but also it is something much more and being just
  over 240 pages one that I finished all too quickly. I could not
  get enough of it. The narrator and main character of the novel is
  a Mr. Stevens who is the butler of a mansion where he heads a
  considerable compliment of staff to keep it running smoothly. His
  employer, a Lord Darlington, is doing what he can to alleviate
  some of the supposed harsher terms of the Versailles treaty and
  realizes too late that he was being used as a pawn by the
  Germans. And what did Mr. Stevens think of this? He didn't, he
  maintains that wondering about what was happening would have
  interfered with his running of the estate. There is also the head
  housekeeper that he buts heads with a few times and also a few
  other instances which makes one wonder if she has something other
  that a professional interest in Mr. Stevens. You'll have to read
  the book if you want to know more. I read mainly Victorian

  for a novel nowadays usually is not. If you get this book you

  <Text category="book">A recent Dallas Morning News column
  profiling T.D. Jakes quoted a University of Houston sociology
  professor saying that Jakes is "incredible in how he's able to
  diagnose people's pain. He has an uncanny ability to put a finger
  on the human condition." Jakes' new book He-Motions illustrates
  the verity of the professor's statement. In He-Motions, Jakes
  nails the issues and challenges Christian men face today in
  trying to fulfill their many roles and pursue their dreams. Jakes
  writes from his heart and soul as a pastor, father, husband and
  entrepreneur. In the opening pages, he describes his motivation
  for writing: "I want to share what I've learned. I want to cut
  through so much of the junk imposed on men today and talk heart
  to heart about what it means to be a man, not in some
  touchy-feely group hug kind of way but in an honest, soul-bearing
  way, which also respects men and honors the women who love them
  and whom they love." Jakes thoroughly succeeds in fulfilling his
  desire for this book. Not only does he address male readers, but
  he also targets female readers who hope to gain insights about
  men. Jakes' no-holds barred writing offers refreshing candor for
  those wanting an honest assessment of who they are and where they
  are in life. Jakes writes about his childhood, his ministry, his
  family and his ups and downs in life-always tying stories to life
  lessons for readers. It does not take the reader long to discern
  that Jakes possesses a vast breadth of wisdom and understanding
  about the inner workings of men in our culture. Jakes writes that
  "a man must value himself." He-Motions can help readers make
  great strides in finding value in themselves-regardless of their
  circumstances. He encourages men to refuse to become discouraged
  but to keep moving toward their destiny while simultaneously
  enjoying the splendid moments of life's journey. The book is
  written as if Jakes is in the room having a one-on-one talk with
  the reader. If it was in fact such a talk, it would surely
  involve laughing, weeping, praying and dreaming. One such example
  of the conversational style is when Jakes writes about balancing
  family and career. He writes, "I'm here to tell you that if you
  don't contain your work life and segregate it from your home
  life, then your career will consume the marriage like a campfire
  blazing outside of its circle of rocks and roaring into a
  life-threatening forest fire." There is not an area of discussion
  where Jakes lets men off the hook. He writes authoritatively
  about power, money and sex. In the financial arena, Jakes
  commands readers, "Stop asking God to bless an area where you
  refuse to obey His Word for your life." In one relationship area
  after another, Jakes' writing leads the reader to
  self-examination, awareness, forgiveness and improvement. His
  writing on subjects such as a man's relationships with his
  father, children, wife, other men, time, money and God is honest
  and down to earth. It is also practical, as are the questions for
  men and women at the end of each chapter. Throughout the book,
  Jakes references the life of David to shed light on the above
  relationships from a Biblical perspective. Jakes encourages
  readers that "someone needs to know who you are and where you are
  at all times in your walk and life." This book could be an
  effective tool to use in a discussion or accountability group to
  help people grow stronger relationships. I encourage men and
  women to take advantage of the wisdom and insights Jakes shares
  in this book</Text>

  <Text category="book">Rewind to 1992. It's the dawn of the
  so-called Information &amp;amp; Knowledge Age. Back then, I wrote
  a book on the need to liberate and effectively channel the
  creativity of all employees in an organization. The rationale: To
  create higher performing organizations in a time of intense
  global competition. With pressing needs for superior innovation.
  And improved productivity. Amid ever-leaner budgets. (Sound
  familiar?) Flash forward a dozen years to today and IDEAS ARE
  FREE (a title echoing Phil Crosby's classic QUALITY IS FREE).
  This new book makes clear today that my impassioned plea from a
  decade ago failed to eradicate idea-stifling organizational
  cultures. Way too many work places, it seems, still quell
  expressions of innovative thinking by both frontline employees
  and middle managers. So the case for turning on the innovation
  spigot needs to be made again with renewed vigor. In answering
  that call, Professors Robinson &amp;amp; Schroeder offer some
  worthwhile and occasionally surprising and compelling
  contributions to this topic that is as relevant now as ever.
  IDEAS ARE FREE presents an articulate case that organizations --
  and individual managers -- need to unleash the *still* largely
  untapped brainpower intentionally and quite unfortunately
  held-back by employees. Three elements make IDEAS ARE FREE
  especially worthy of your time and money. 1. The authors aim
  their advice at regular workaday managers. Sure, they rightfully
  point out how organizational systems are often "dysfunctional."
  And they make the case that many corporate practices actually
  *discourage* creative contributions by individuals even as they
  try to *incent* those very behaviors. But Robinson &amp;amp;
  Schroeder don't aim their prescriptions at policy-making top
  executives only. Many chapters conclude with what the authors
  term "guerilla tactics" -- clear directives for simple actions
  that even frontline supervisors can put to work "without the
  boss's permission." 2. The book dramatically makes the case that
  paying for ideas -- as part of an organization's formal
  suggestion systems -- is fraught with potential negative
  side-effects. My own corporate experience as an executive
  championing a newly installed suggestion system bears out the
  startling reality that this well-intentioned process can turn
  into a self-destructive minefield. (And, let the record show, I
  largely missed this dimension in covering suggestion systems back
  in my '92 work.) 3. Many interesting, well-developed (albeit
  occasionally dated) anecdotes illustrate the book's sound
  principles. They help make IDEAS ARE FREE a grounded, engaging,
  and palatable read. Back in '92, I suggested in my book
  MAVERICKS! that, "Managers should be asking questions like: What
  is the value of a useful new idea? If one good idea leads to
  another, where could thousands and thousands lead us? What is the
  cost to the organization for not tapping the endlessly renewable
  resource of ideas in our employees' heads?" Getting to the root
  of the problem, I asked: "Isn't the job of a manager to
  *recognize and choose* from lots of great ideas generated by
  fellow work associates?" And answered: "Unfortunately, most
  managers -- even those who claim they invite suggestions from
  their people -- subscribe to the time-honored myth that a
  manager's job is to *have* the ideas." In 2004, Robinson
  &amp;amp; Schroeder again plow many of these very same themes
  (and cite data that also have been around for a long time).
  Still, this book explores afresh the opportunities that arise
  from drawing out the best thinking of every employee. And it
  presents realistic tactics that all managers can deploy to
  effectively deal with these still-critical issues. Wherever you
  sit in the hierarchy, read IDEAS ARE FREE to seize powerful ideas
  about potential gains for your organization's progress and
  prosperity. Don Blohowiak Lead Well&amp;#x1A; Institut</Text>

  "animal" intelligence that worms its way into the reader's mind.

  <Text category="book">Dr. Temperance Brennan, a forensic
  anthropologist, is called upon to aid in the investigation of a
  commercial jet crash in the mountains of North Carolina. Andrew
  Ryan, a colleague and romantic possible, turns up on site also
  when his partner in the Quebec police is listed on the flight
  manifest. When Temperance discovers a foot that does not seem to
  come from the disaster site, things begin to get dangerous for
  her and those around her. It becomes a clue in a deadly mystery
  involving many highly placed individuals who want their secret to
  remain just that , a secret. Temperance and Ryan spark reactions
  from each other, the question is, will it ignite or just
  smolder?? This novel is full of forensic science and detail that
  open the door to a fascinating yet gruesome world. Kathy Reichs
  has an afterword page in which she talks about 9/11 and the real
  disaster site in NYC where she aided in determining the
  identities of victims from the Twin Towers, serving on the
  government disaster response team, much like Temperance in this
  novel.......although she says the horror and emotional impact was
  more than she could have imagined. The novel was written and
  published 2 months before the real disaster occurred</Text>
  <Text category="book">If you are familiar with the work of
  Strobel, this book will continue to impress you. If you are not
  however, and would like to know where the author is coming from,
  I encourage you to read his previous works, "The Case for Christ"
  and "The Case for Faith" so that you might better understand
  Strobel. Some people have condemned this book because Strobel
  doesn't present the evolutionary side well. I have a few quick
  observations to make. First of all, he's a journalist; he asks
  tough questions and, for the most part, gets good responses.
  Second, everyone has an agenda, without exception. Strobel, and
  those who he interviews, analyze and break down the views of
  prominent evolutionists and modern Darwinian scientific views.
  Finally, it is clear from the outset that Strobel wants to make a
  compelling case for ID. This is not an unreasonable goal. The
  fact that he doesn't interview evolutionists shouldn't bother
  anyone, based on his obvious objectives. If you want a book that
  allows evolutionists and designers to write you want to look into
  a point-counter point series book. If you want to understand the
  current ID debate and would like to get a real good look at some
  of the cosmological evidence for a creator, this book is for
  you</Text>
  <Text category="book">Thankfully, this is NOT littered with
  platitudes and meaningless anaologies, the hallmarks of 99% of
  the latest-and-greatest business books. Especially since it was
  written in 1999, Moore's is an incredibly insightful and
  prophetic book on strategy for the high-tech industry. He was
  predicting cutting edge changes then that are coming into reality
  today in 2005. The book is much more descriptive than
  prescriptive though, and is best used as a tool to instigate
  discussions about corporate strategy, rather than as a checklist
  for strategic implementation. I help run an online software
  development company and although it isn't exactly "high tech" I
  still found the vast majority of it very helpful and the rest of
  it fascinating. Market shifts are demanding broadband wireless
  Internet everywhere--free. Companies are shifting towards
  web-basing software applications. All very relevant to my
  business. The book is well written, an easy and moderately fast
  read, and very accessible by anyone who is technology-savvy
  enough to at least hold an email address. Yes, buy it. Buy the
  paperback and save money. Short Synopsis: In the infancy of a
  market, products need to be highly tailored to meet the
  psychological and technical needs of leading edge techno-geeks;
  nothing new here. When a company wants to take that product and
  make it marketable to the middle majority--where the biggest
  money sits--it requires a commitment to discipline and shift its
  strategy in order to do so. The emphasis shifts intially to
  identifying a single niche segment and creating a comprehensive,
  tailored product, that meets all of their needs--create the
  "whole product" by using partners and 3rd party services to
  patchwork the thing together. Then, stop tweaking the product. If
  that works, pick related niches and go after them the same way,
  creating the "whole product" for each of them. Once people at
  large are comfortable enough to make the paradigm shift for that
  market (this all deals with new, high-tech changes) and start
  doing so en masse, the strategy must completely shift again to a
  ship-first / fix-the-product-later mentality in a mad, market
  share scramble. At this phase, you are "In the Tornado." Lots of
  examples of successful and abysmal strategies used by high tech
  companies whose names are familiar to everyone, at each stage
  mentioned above.</Text>

  to be a saint. Thomas a Kempis's words cut to the heart and ring
  true over and over. In the normal state of human depravity,
  deception, duplicity, relativism, and excuse-making no one could
  write such a book without a transcendant, almighty, omniscient,

  <Text category="book">I, too, have an MA in American History, and
  I was never given reason to think about each of two questions
  raised by this important book. Firstly and fundamentally, what
  was the timetable by which the British military were expected to
  leave the former colonies, and, second, what "property" could
  they take with them, especially as "property" had a very
  particular meaning here in the new nation? Was the Revolution in
  large part fought to maintain slavery? That surely bears on the
  problematic nature of our Constitution. The wonderfully gifted
  writer and historian (would that they were always the same
  thing!)poses these vital questions. And we are fortunate that the
  near simultaneous publication of David B. Davis' Inhuman Bondage
  complements this fine effort. So, as one reviewer suggests, it is
  in some ways an overwritten period, but Schama and Davis add
  something new and exciting to the dialogue. My thanks</Text>

  <Text category="book">Gaylife on the English countryside is like
  everywhere, you never know when your BF (boyfriend) gets bored
  with you. The battle with London's competitive nightlife makes
  you reguarly ask yourself: &amp;amp;quot;What have I to
  offer&amp;amp;quot;? The efforts to entertain your BF are as
  tiresome as the question how organize your own life so it won't
  get dull. And once you got things fixed you yourself run into
  this willing guy. The tragicomedy the Spell tells the story of
  four men, Robin, the ageing architect who enjoys his life
  together with his younger BF Justin, a witty layabout, Robin's
  son Danny, a georgeous body dealing in superficiality and
  Justin's former lover Alex, a well-mannered young man in search
  for consistency. To find out if they all get what they want is a
  truly delicious way to spend your time. The story is written out
  of the perspective of all leading parts and therefore very nicely
  ballanced. Hollinghurst is gifted with a great sense of
  attentiveness. His characters show many different moods caused by
  tiny events. Every self-assured attitude is merciless exposed. I
  recognized myself and my friends many times without realizing
  this ever before. It made me smile and reassured me. I think this
  is Hollinghurst's most post-modern novel. Unlike the
  Swimming-Pool Library's sexual odyssee this is a splintered
  glimps into life and how down to earth it can be</Text>
  <Text category="book">It's easy to realize once again what makes
  Garth Ennis one of the best writers in the field when reading
  this one. Throughout the story I was unable to predict what was
  going to happen on the next page. And despite Ennis making this
  into a rollercoaster ride he still keeps it all believable. Mind
  you, this story is not on par with the Preacher series, not much
  is, but it still is a story that rises far above the average
  comic book story. The characters are all interesting, often
  funny, and they'll hold your attention with ease. Not once was
  the story faltering. And in the case of you being a smoker-maybe
  at the end you'll be cured of that habit. As another reviewer
  pointed out this is one hell of an anti-smokers `add'. So, if you
  feel like picking up a well told story with Constantine in the
  lead, you'll do best to pick up this one. If however, you are not
  yet acquainted with Ennis's Preacher than you better turn to that
  one.</Text>
  <Text category="book">Lee Smolin is a very deep thinker and
  original physics theorist, ready if needs be, to question
  cherished assumptions. One is humbled at how fertile his mind is
  and how he is familiar with the ideas and the research of so many
  people The book is mainly an account of his misgivings about
  string theory, where he initially states, as he sees it, the five
  big problems in physics. In this context, he makes the very
  important point that since the end of the 1970's there has not
  been a single breakthrough in our understanding of elementary
  particle physics and, in particular, he claims string theory does
  not achieve such a breakthrough. In making his case against
  string theory he discusses what string theory has given and shows
  how it appeared to offer a solution to some of the problems of
  theoretical physics. But then he builds up his case against the
  theory. He says that string theory does not reproduce the
  standard model, probably the most successful theory in physics,
  but even predicts particles not seen in nature. It did not
  predict and does not cater for dark energy, nor does it make new
  precise and falsifiable predictions. In particular he says string
  theory does not offer a solution to the foundational problems of
  quantum mechanics. He also notes that here is no complete
  formulation for string theory. He shows though how the five
  versions of string theory could be unified if membranes rather
  than strings were assumed, but notes that this theory, M theory,
  still remains a tantalizing conjecture. He says hopes for a
  unique string theory have receded. This reviewer would not dare
  to comment on his assertions but will say that any assertions he
  makes, are based on a very thorough knowledge of modern
  theoretical physics and merit the full consideration and respect
  of the reader. Indeed new ideas are needed in physics as Lee
  Smolin says. We are missing something big. There is a feeling
  though that we are on the verge of that big breakthrough - that
  something just beyond our understanding at the moment will
  surface through the `murk' into our consciousness and
  revolutionize our knowledge of nature. The clues are there. To do
  this, Lee rightly says that the sort of people who see through
  universal assumptions and ask new questions are needed. He also
  says that progress sometimes requires deep philosophical thinking
  but sometimes does not. And whether it is `lateral' thinking or a
  breakthrough revolution in `conceptual' thinking, new thinking is
  definitely required. Lee concludes his book saying that what he
  intends to do is just that. He chooses to start with a paper of
  his on the relationship between quantum and thermal fluctuation.
  A good choice perhaps. I strongly recommend that anybody who is
  interested in physics and the current problems and mysteries in
  the area to immediately buy this book, if they have not already
  done so.</Text>

  <Text category="book">It's fascinating to compare my own
  experiences, having lived now 3 years in Germany, to those of an
  American from 125 years earlier. I've been learning to speak
  German, and his Appendix on the "awful" German language was
  hilarious. In poking fun at German grammar (e.g., long
  sentences), he purposely commits the same errors in his own
  writing. The scene "riding" the glacier down the Alps was so
  funny I had tears running down my face. It's amazing to think
  that it was written in 1879, when America was barely a century
  old, and the insights and perceptions then can be incredibly,
  eerily similar to either my or "typical" American's attitudes
  today. I'd recommend it to anyone, but particularly to anyone
  visiting or living in Europe. It's way funnier than his
  "Innocents Abroad", which is also a good read on travel in
  Europe</Text>
  <Text category="book">Jonathan Glover's book is not quite like
  anything you've read on war, state terror, and genocide. The tour
  of twentieth-century horrors is thematic rather than
  chronological, organized according to the ethical issues Glover
  wants to explore. This takes a little getting used to, but it
  allows the author to jump, for example, from the First World War
  to the Cuban Missile Crisis, to see which lessons had been
  learned in the interim and which might be applied in the future.
  The cumulative power of Glover's pointillist technique is
  enormous. &amp;amp;quot;Humanity&amp;amp;quot; combines a
  clear-eyed (necessarily often gruesome) depiction of *in*humanity
  with an informed and enlightening discussion of how leaders and
  ordinary people can change things for the better. As an
  examination of the psychological and existential origins of mass
  murder and genocide, it marks an advance on Ervin Staub's classic
  &amp;amp;quot;Roots of Evil,&amp;amp;quot; and should be of
  interest to any student of modern history and politics</Text>

  Take a non-partisan journey with Dr Savage and open your so

  Wacko are polar opposites</Text>
  <Text category="book">I was wrong. Ok, I've admitted it. I always
  thought science fiction or futuristic type novels weren't my cup
  of tea. While reading Conspiracy in Death I realized I couldn't
  have been more wrong - I love this futuristic series! A homeless
  man is murdered and the case is assigned to Eve Dallas, since
  it's not a random act of violence. This man, Snooks, died when
  his heart was surgically removed by what appeared to be a very
  skilled surgeon. When Dallas digs a bit further, she discovers
  that this crime is connected to another committed in New York
  City where an aged LC (licensed companion) died as the result of
  her liver being removed. After even more digging, Dallas
  discovers a case in Chicago and one abroad that were all similar.
  These were not the result of black market organ sales since all
  of the victims were within a few months of dying. In order for
  Eve Dallas to find the murderer she had to figure out why these
  victims were chosen. The closer she got to that answer, the more
  nervous very influential politicians and doctors became. When she
  got too close to the truth, the villain had to put a stop to her
  investigation. The best way to get Dallas off the case was to
  have her suspended from the police department. This was a simple
  procedure since there was a conflict between the patrol officer
  who discovered Snook's body and Dallas. When that patrolwoman was
  brutally murdered suspicion fell on Dallas. Stripped of her badge
  and weapon, the very items that have been the heart and sole of
  her during her adult life, she has to deal with not only the idea
  of not being a police detective, but also with trying to solve
  this crime having her hands tied. The main plot was interesting
  but the villain was predictable and no surprise. There was
  excellent character development and as usual J.D. Robb (AKA Nora
  Roberts) draws the reader into the suspense to the point of not
  being able to put down the book. What makes this book above
  average and falling into the excellent range is the fantastic
  subplot of Eve Dallas being stripped of her identity as a
  policewoman and how she must deal with the various facets of
  that. At times, it was more intense and more exciting that the
  main plot. This is definitely one to read, as all of the "In
  Death" series books have been. Start with the first book when
  reading because J.D. Robb always has a couple of instances where
  she reflects on previous happenings. Or you can start with the
  first book just because it's the beginning of an excellent
  adventure!</Text>

  <Text category="book">The Boston based author, Dennis Lehane,
  wrote a great detective story with a social background so great,
  it is almost more important than the plot. "Mystic River" differs
  from Lehane's other books and indeed raises him to the next level
  as a writer. "Mystic River" is set in the fictional Boston
  suburb, called East Buckingham (the author explains it as an
  amalgamate of Dorchester, Charlestown and South Boston and it
  really feels like Dorchester), home mostly to white working
  class, with plenty of crime. I liked the background info
  especially since I could relate to it, knowing the area... The
  first part, which is the base and explanation for later events,
  takes place in 1975, when one of the three eleven-year old
  neighborhood boys playing in the street is abducted by two men in
  an apple-smelling car, and although he comes back after four
  days, his life as well as his friends' is changed forever. The
  ways of the boys soon part, Dave (the boy taken by the men) lives
  a quiet life, has a wife and a son, and likes his memories of
  being a football player in high school. Jimmy, the "bad boy",
  after doing some time in prison settles down as a storeowner with
  a nineteen-year old daughter from his first marriage, second wife
  and their two daughters. The third boy, college-educated Sean,
  becomes a policeman. When Jimmy's beautiful daughter, Katie, is
  found murdered in the park after a night out Dave comes home
  covered in blood, Sean gets assigned to the case. There are many
  leads to different people... But the case is difficult.
  Meanwhile, Jimmy and his family embark on the search of their
  own. The plot is very good until the end, and psychological
  details as well as the insights into the society are extremely
  accurate. The characters are very real, especially Jimmy and
  Sean, who are central to the plot. Their trauma after Dave's
  abduction made a lasting effect on their lives - in very
  different ways. They are complicated, multifaceted people, very
  well developed as literary characters. Some side protagonists,
  depicting perhaps types rather than individuals (Bobby, Roman,
  the Savage brothers, Sergeant Whitey), are very good. I was in
  the grasp of this book until the end - it is not only great
  entertainment, but also food for thought. The movie based on
  "Mystic River" with Sean Penn is equally moving - recommended for
  those with little time...</Text>
  <Text category="book">His basic thesis is that a liberal empire
  can be a greatly positive force in the world, and that the United
  States is already an empire, but that our inablility to
  acknowledge the fact leads us to waste our opportunities to be
  the afore mentioned positive force. Ferguson writes that America
  is plagued by an attention deficit disorder and too much love of
  the good life. Thus, we get distracted too easily from important
  events overseas, and when we do try to intervene, we want quick
  fixes and low costs. I couldn't agree more with most of these
  points. As an American, I'm greatly ashamed of our collective
  ignorance. I hate feeling like a foreigner in my our country
  because I watch the news or can find Sumatra on a map. Also, the
  book strikes a chord with me because of my frustration with half
  measures in foreign interventions. Countless times, I believe
  America has done more harm than good by, if you will, talking the
  talk but not walking the walk. If we commit to something, we need
  to follow through. This is as true in Iraq today as it has been
  in the past. We've claimed to support democracy in Latin America,
  but then turned bannana republics into bannana autocracies. We
  greatly prolonged and increased Vietnam's suffering without
  changing the end result at all. With all this commonality,
  however, there are a few leaps of logic that Ferguson makes that
  I can't bring myself to agree with. Basically, he didn't sell me
  on the thought that the imperial model is the best way to develop
  the world. How are we supposed to know what is best for everyone?
  Won't our own biases and self interests inevitably distort even
  our most altruistic efforts? When Ferguson hold's up the British
  Empire as a model of success, I can't help but notice that the
  best results came only to those places of British colonization,
  with horrendous consequences for each of the native populations
  there. And the two greatest examples of beneficial American
  imperialism - Japan and Germany - were already highly developed
  before World War II, so it probably wasn't that much of a wonder
  that we were able to help them return to such a state. Even if
  the positive power of empire is conceded, there are important
  differences between the state of world during the British empire
  and the state of the world now. It's a concern of immunity from
  repercussions. In the golden age of imperialism, Europe was in a
  kind of splendid isolation from its empires. Not to say that
  there were no reprercussions, but, with the only modern navies in
  the world, Europe was immune to any very serious threats. On the
  other hand, in today's world, as an effect of globalization,
  power has become more decentralized in some respects. Think
  WMDs,terrorists, and foreign investments in the U.S. economy, for
  example. Can America as easily afford to make enemies in the
  developing world as the British could? In the end "Colossus"
  didn't settle any agruments for me, but raised new and
  interesting questions. It is a book that makes you think, and
  that in and of itself is worth four stars.</Text>

  <Text category="book">Shakespeare's life is frustratingly beyond
  our sight. Aside from the plays (which, in many cases, come down
  to us in different versions), we have a slim scattering of legal
  documents, marriage and birth records, and vague secondary
  accounts. As the world's preeminent Shakespeare scholar,
  Greenblatt has managed to assemble all these sources and, with a
  healthy dose of conjecture, arrive at something resembling a
  biography of the world's greatest dramatist. More than that,
  though, this work is a biography of the age in which Shakespeare
  lived and wrote---Elizabethan and Jacobian London---and how the
  major events of this time affected Shakespeare's plays. For
  example, the writing of King Lear may have been encouraged by a
  trial in 1603 in which two sisters tried to have their father
  declared insane so they could take control of his wealth and
  estate, while the youngest daughter (named Cordell) tried to stop
  them---a story uncannily similar to what is considered to be the
  Bard's greatest tragedy. What impressed me the most about this
  biography is how ORDINARY Shakespeare seemingly was. He didn't
  seem pretentious or snobbish, as some people envision him. He was
  born to a humble family and lived frugally, despite dying a
  rather wealthy man. Although Greenblatt's writing is clear and
  accessible, he makes the assumption that you have already read
  Shakespeare's plays, or at least are VERY familiar with them. I
  have read about two thirds of them and felt a little behind when
  he discussed plays I hadn't read, so if you haven't read more
  than, say, ten of his plays, the major ones, you need to crack
  open the Norton Shakespeare (of which Greenblatt is the
  editor-in-chief) before you approach Will in the World.</Text>

  <Text category="book">Perhaps the long shadow of Francis Parkman
  has discouraged historians from writing about the French and
  Indian War (Seven Year's War). Whatever the reason it's good to
  see from the publication of several books that Americans are
  taking a renewed interest in the pre-revolutionary period when
  the British were triumphant and the Indians still counted as a
  political force. It's past time for a thorough revision of
  Parkman -- who was ungenerous with the Indians although I
  thrilled as a young reader to his descriptions of their ferocity
  -- for example, the "insensate fury" of the Iroquois. Actually,
  the Iroquois were less insensate than they were astute. Calloway
  omits the bloody details and vivid writing of Parkman but he
  gives us a thorough picture of what happened in the wake of the
  English victory over the French in North America. In particular
  he focuses on the frontier and the built-in conflict of American
  settlers, British policy, and the Indian tribes who either went
  down to defeat with the French or were betrayed by perfidious
  Albion. They made their point, however, in Pontiac's War and by
  clearing white settlers from the frontier. But their numbers were
  declining and they would soon be overwhelmed. This is a good book
  about the issues of the frontier between Whites and Indians. In
  addition, there's a good account of the French movement from
  Canada to Louisiana and the Spanish rule in Florida and the
  trans-Mississippi. Smallchief</Text>

  <Text category="book">DeYoung begins by relating how Bush pushed
  Powell out at the end of his 1st term, without the courtesy of
  even personally discussing it with him; making matters worse was
  the fact that Bush didn't even know why Powell was at the White
  House when it came time to say "Good Bye." Colin Powell came from
  Jamaican parents (often called "Jewmaicans" by American Negroes
  because of the emphasis they placed on hard work and education),
  and during his early life in the NYC area suffered little, if
  any, racial prejudice. Later on, unfortunately, the insults were
  quite aggravating, but Powell was determined to not let them
  inhibit his performance. Powell was an indifferent student in
  high school and at CCNY (majored in geology); however, ROTC
  piqued his sophomore-year interest and he soon became a standout.
  Powell went on to be selected outstanding cadet, and top graduate
  (or very close) in every military training setting he undertook,
  as well as a top MBA student at George Washington University. He
  also was top-ranked by superiors in almost every military
  assignment, leading to his being offered a White House
  fellowship, which in turn provided Powell with travel to Russia
  and China and brought him in contact with a number of influential
  people who were impressed enough to forward Powell onto Chairman
  of the Joint Chiefs, National Security Advisor, and Secretary of
  State. One of Powell's "secrets of success" was to
  enthusiastically implement all orders, even those he considered
  silly - Powell himself believed that doing otherwise grounded the
  careers of many talented others. Unfortunately, Powell eventually
  crossed paths with Dick Cheney (a bit of a problem during Gulf
  War I; a serious problem when Cheney became V.P.). Between
  Cheney's far-right bias ("out on the looney fringe" - per Powell)
  and Bush II's "disturbingly disjointed" decision-making - per
  Treasury Secretary O'Neill), Powell's contributions as Secretary
  of State were severely limited and constantly undermined and
  countermanded - often with Don Rumsfeld's help. In addition, he
  was often left out of important decisions, especially when out of
  the country. Ultimately, Powell's credibility suffered from the
  inaccurate information provided in his U.N. speech attesting to
  Saddam's WMD. The big question, still debated, is "Why didn't he
  resign?" His supporters believe the reason is that Powell's
  nature simply didn't allow anything less than 100% support.
  Bottom Line: If Cheney had not been such an ideologue (telling
  Bush there were no candidates good enough to run as his V.P. -
  ignoring Powell, and then sliding into the position himself),
  Powell would be V.P. today, possibly President in 2008.
  Similarly, if Bush #41 had not been so stubborn and instead
  replaced Quayle with Powell in '92, Powell might well have become
  first V.P., and then President</Text>
  <Text category="book">As with many of the "For Dummies" series,
  Controlling Cholesterol is a well-executed overview of many
  issues relevant to cholesterol. Author Carol Rinzler's light and
  humorous discussion ranges from a concise description of what
  cholesterol is, to many of the different approaches to lowering
  cholesterol and why "target" values for cholesterol can differ in
  different people. There's an especially helpful discussion on the
  effects of various popular diets like Atkins', Sugar Busters, and
  Protein Power -- pluses and minuses of each. "Ten Cholesterol
  Myths" in Chapter 16 is a great discussion that can help clear up
  much of the murkiness surrounding cholesterol issues and can help
  answer many of the questions that I am asked when treating
  cholesterol in my patients (in my cardiology practice). One
  criticism: Like all books about cholesterol, Controlling
  Cholesterol for Dummies gives the reader the impression that high
  cholesterol is the only way to identify risk for heart disease,
  as well as a means of diminishing risk of heart attack. This is
  patently untrue, but not really a criticism of this book as it is
  of the standard thinking on cholesterol. There are better ways!
  Nonetheless, this book does serve its intended purpose very well:
  educate the reader thoroughly on the conventional understanding
  of cholesterol.</Text>

  <Text category="book">Are you looking for a way to get your kids
  into the kitchen, turing out tasty projects? I know I was--and I
  went through about fifteen "kids" cookbooks at the local
  bookstore before I stumbled on this little gem. It was the only
  cookbook (other than The Everything Kid's Cookbooks) that would
  actually get a child into the kitchen. The projects are appealing
  on all levels--they are easy to assemble, they are too cute for
  words, and they have super easy to follow pictoral instructions.
  It also has a good balance of entrees to deserts, unlike some of
  the family cookbooks I've reviewed. And with the desserts--like
  cookies--it takes one basic recipe and shows you about four
  different ways to use it--marvelous! It's also pantry
  friendly--no star fruit or rare ingredients you don't have laying
  around. Now if you're looking for a kids cookbook to vary your
  family's fare, then keep in mind this is a slender picture-book
  sized volume--you won't find more than 22 projects in the whole
  book. For a good standard family cookbook, I recommmend Beyond
  Mac 'n' Cheese by MOPS. But if you are looking to get your kids
  (12 and under) into the kitchen to spend some time together
  having fun at the counter, then don't hesitate to buy this little
  gem! It is my number one recommendation for children's cookbook,
  project-wise. For the above twelve set, I recommend the
  Everything Kid's Cookbook because it is a little more geared
  towards meals and has crossword puzzles and fun foods that are
  meant to be played with. If you are looking for a cookbook with
  tons of recipes that will appeal to your family, be pantry
  friendly *and* save you money, check out "Cheap. Fast.

  <Text category="book">I have only read the Swedish translation of
  what I suppose is the "old edition", but judging by "Look inside
  this book", this new English-language edition incorporates much
  material from the old. Incidentally, the Swedish edition gives
  the authors name as Kallistos Ware, apparently his taken Orthodox
  name, while Timothy Ware is his original, given name. In Sweden,
  the Swedish translation of "The Orthodox Church" is the only
  readily available book on the history of the Orthodox Church.
  Apparently, its used informally as a textbook in some college
  classes on Church history. It also contains chapters on theology
  and worship. In my opinion, the book is a necessary introduction
  for those interested in Orthodox Church history. Its first
  chapters summarize the history of this Church during the
  Byzantine Empire, under Islam, and in Russia both before and
  during Communism. Of particular interest is the authors
  interpretation of the Catholic-Orthodox split, usually dated to
  1054. The author believes that the so-called Fourth Crusade in
  1204 was the real and final consummation of this split. However,
  the book must also be read with some reservations. The author is,
  after all, an Orthodox Christian himself. Its safe to assume that
  there is a certain bias here and there. For instance, Ware denies
  that the Byzantine Church was caesaropapist, a very untenable
  suggestion. At other times, he is surprisingly "liberal" for an
  Orthodox. For instance, he paints Mehmet Fatih, the Muslim
  conqueror of Constantinople, as a very tolerant ruler. I also
  wonder about his interpretation of the Church father Cyprian.
  Even so, "The Orthodox Church" remains an indepensable book for
  those looking for a short and concise historical over-view of
  this remarkable Christian Church.</Text>

  <Text category="book">David Baldacci has a knack for writing
  fiction that sucks you in and holds you no matter what the story.
  Part of the talent is to introduce interesting characters. This
  book is no exception. Sara Evans is a clerk working for a Supreme
  Court justice. She is quite close to another clerk (Michael
  Fiske) who works for a different judge. Michael asks Sara to
  marry him but Sara really loves Michael's brother John, who Sara
  has only seen once and never officially met. Michael comes across
  an appeal that intrigues him (to say exactly why would be a
  spoiler and it is only revealed very late in the book as to
  exactly what intrigued him) so much that he pulls it out before
  it is filed and goes to visit the requestor. That happens to be a
  Rufus Harms who is serving a life sentence in an Army prison for
  murdering a girl. When Michael goes to see Harms, practically all
  Hell breaks loose and Harms realizes he is in danger himself and
  some mysterious evil guys from the prison murder Michael.
  Apparently there was some secrets in Harms appeal that some
  powerful unknown men do not want known. Michael's murder is
  investigated by his brother John (an ex-cop who is now a defense
  lawyer for the lowest of the low criminals) and he enlists the
  aid of Sara who was close to Michael and knows some things about
  Michael. Sara is instantly in love with John and the more they
  start investigating the more they put their lives at risk from
  the unknown powerful men. Additionally, the police start to
  suspect John of the murder of his brother especially when he is
  named as the sole beneficiary of Michael's life insurance.
  Meanwhile Rufus Harms has escaped prison from some of those men
  that tried to kill him. So we have tension throughout to see if
  Rufus will survive as well as John and Sara before the evil guys
  get them. There is a lot of good information about what goes on
  behind the scenes at the Supreme Court. A good rea</Text>

  <Text category="book">This book still does not address many areas
  I find interesting in James Brown's career but I find it a
  natural companion to the three other JB books in my collection:
  Cynthia Rose's "Living In America: The Soul Saga Of James Brown";
  Geoff Brown's biography "James Brown"; and ofcourse, the
  Brown/Tucker "The Godfather Of Soul - James Brown". All three dig
  deep into this metaphysical musician's mind but this one has a
  stronger narrative, a bit less guarded: his late '80s fall is
  described in a more contrite way, for example. His scientific
  study of his audience is perhaps something new in his dialogue -
  but he broaches the subject of how music motivates women in a
  different way than it does men, then immediately moves on to the
  next thought. Even by 2005 standards his live albums contain some
  of the most overt sexuality, obviously directed at the female
  fans, ever recorded. Similarly, his admonitions to admonishes
  contemporary rap/hip-hop artists are eloquent but must be deemed
  a bit self-righteous: there is alot of "adult" content in his
  catalogue which can't be explained away as "art". However, fans
  can trace his development into more "cerebral" music, with more
  and more sensitive ballads and socially-conscious tunes being
  produced from the late '60s on. I was happy to read his
  description of Little Richard's assistance in his early career,
  but a bit disheartened when he suggested that Penniman was
  basically a Rock and Roll raver - I find it hard to believe that
  this publication brought out his true feelings about his Georgia
  neighbor - the influence is quite obvious and not just on
  "Chonnie On Chon". Another depressing ommission is with Marva
  Whitney, his popular lead female vocalist from c.'67 to '70. A
  recent documentary reveals that Marva traveled To Vietnam with
  the star but here he simply says that he was only allowed to
  travel with a small part of his musical backup. Despite the above
  concerns, with this book James Brown has shown the literary world
  that he is a writer. Ofcourse this was obvious to the musical
  world - just listen to "Don't Be A Drop Out", "I Don't Want
  Nobody To Give Me Nothing", "The Man In The Glass", "I'm Not
  Demanding", "It's Christmas Time", and "Peace In The
  World"</Text>
  <Text category="book">The story is both true and extremely
  unique: The Author, who is an Austrian mountaineer and a SS Nazi
  officer at the same time, escapes from a British POW camp in
  India with the goal to go through Tibet to Japan-occupied Burma,
  to be sent back to Germany, so as not to miss his chance to
  participate in WWII. The extreme difficulties of hiding from
  officials and surviving the wintry elements of the Himalaya
  mountains make his Burma plan impossible, so he stays in Tibet.
  His unthinkable achievements include storming his way into the
  "Forbidden City" (Lhassa, the capital), gaining employment in the
  Tibetian Government, becoming a friend of the "God-King" Dalai
  Lama - an extremely bright, knowledge-hungry teenager, and
  learning the Tibetian language to the degree which anable him to
  do live interpretation for Dalai Lana of English-language movies
  ("Believe me, it is not easy for a German to translate
  Shakespearian English into Tibetian"). Going with a yak through
  the snows of the 20,000-feet Himalayan passes, escaping merciless
  robbers, manouvering between border guards - make Seven Years in
  Tibet a great adventure book. However, the insightful and rich
  observations about Tibetian people, customs, culture and
  politics, go far beyond any other available information on that
  far-away country, and Dalai-Lama's foreword to this book confirms
  this fact. The peaceful and friendly life and culture of Tibet is
  raped by military annexation of Tibet by China in 1951. The
  ancient monasteries are destroyed, the Puritan-like culture is
  replaced by such crude elements of civilization as e.g. brothels
  for the occupying soldiers, Dalai Lama twice escapes to India,
  and so does the Author; one third of the Tibetians die of
  starvation. "Seven Tears ib Tibet" allows us a bitter-seet inside
  into see a country, that lived the way how countries in medieval
  times lived; also, the country trampled and largely destroyed by
  its aggressive neighbour.</Text>

  high school history teacher, I marvel at Crichton's ability book
  after book to research a topic down to the bone then flesh it out
  in an utterly believable and compelling way. For this reason the
  Great Train Robbery is for me my favorite Crichton work, even
  though it may lack the polish of Jurassic Park or Congo or one of
  his more recent books. TGTR takes us to 19th century London and
  gives us a plausible behind the scenes look both at the
  masterminding of this incredible train robbery, as well as life
  in general in 19th century London. So often history books give
  names, dates, connections, but leave one with the question, "Yes,
  but what was it like?" Crichton answers this better than any book
  I ever read on the Sheep Enclosure Act or most any other dry
  text. Some of it may be fanciful, but it certainly seemed as well
  supported as many another full blown history text. At any rate, I
  highly recommend this book for any Crichton fan, master criminal
  fan, or interested history student. The main character, whose
  name escapes me, alone is a grand study and reminiscent of a
  larger than life character from a Hugo or Dumas novel. Very
  fascinating and rapidly moving.</Text>

  <Text category="book">When I was in the sixth grade we moved
  twice, and in all three of the schools from New Jersey to
  Connecticut to Japan I got to study Ancient Greece in the history
  part of the class. I also got a lot of mileage out of having read
  Edith Hamilton's "Mythology" (I still have my mythology report
  with my versions of all of the illustrations). But in all the
  times I got to study Ancient Greece before, during, and after the
  sixth grade I never got to do any of the fun stuff that Avery
  Hart &amp;amp; Paul Mantell come up with for "Ancient Greece!: 40
  Hands-On Activities to Experience This Wondrous Age." This
  Kaleidoscope Kids volume for kids ages 7-12 not only offers
  activities but also a variety of information about the Ancient
  Greeks. So this is not simply a book of activities that teachers
  can pick and choose from to give their students hands-on
  experiences, it is also a source of facts and stories that will
  supplement what exists in whatever textbook is being used.
  Throughout the book there are "Great Greeks!" and things to
  "Think About." After reminding young readers of the gifts that
  have come down to us from Ancient Greece, Hart and Mantell get
  students acclimated to the idea of looking at the past from the
  perspective of those who lived way back when. Then the book looks
  at key periods of Greek history. "Meet the Minoans: The
  Pre-Greeks of Crete" looks at the culture that gave rise to the
  greatness of Greece with activities to make a Greek yo-yo, a
  Great Mother figure, a Hamster Labyrinth (without the Minotaur),
  and a fantastic fresco. That gives you an indication of the sort
  of activities to be found in this book before we even get to
  Greece itself. Other chapters are devoted to "The Age of Heroes,"
  where you get a super-short version of "The Iliad" and can build
  a Trojan Horse, "Language Unites!" (including speaking "Pig
  Greek"), "The Dawn of a Golden Age," where you can organize a
  pentathlon and make a victory wreath, and "Ye Gods! Greek
  Religion and Mythology," where you can design your own
  constellation. In the last part of the book chapters cover
  "Classical Athens: The Flower of Ancient Civilization," where you
  get to build a Greek Temple with Ionic columns (or even build the
  entire Parthenon), "Think For Yourself: Philosophy," where
  students can make a monochord or hold a symposium, and "The
  Amazing Arts," which covers create sculptures and painting pots
  in the first part and making masks to make up a Greek play in the
  second part. The final chapter covers "A Wider World: Alexander
  the Great and the Hellenistic Age," where you can start a
  library. At the end, students can appreciate how being a Greek
  meant standing in the center of the world (as least, as far as
  the Ancient Greeks were concerned). Again, there are some key
  issues to be discussed to go along with the activities. Students
  can debate what is the difference between a hero and a celebrity,
  understand why every vote counts in a democracy, and decide what
  makes somebody beautiful. Learning how to press olives or how
  huge blocks of marble were transported across the sea, gives
  students an appreciation for how things were different way back
  when. Throughout the book Hart and Mantell show how ancient ideas
  live on in modern traditions, which remains the biggest legacy of
  the Ancient Greeks. I teach Classical Greek &amp;amp; Roman
  Mythology (not to be confused with Modern Greek &amp;amp; Roman
  Mythology apparently) but I teach it online so I do not really
  have any opportunities to have my students engage in hands-on
  activities. But that does not mean I cannot do them in the
  privacy of my own home or that elementary school teachers will
  not find these extremely useful for their unit on Ancient Greece.
  Although I am suddenly reminded of coming up with the "Sparthens"
  (a.k.a. the warriors with the brains) in elementary school. But
  that is another story</Text>

  Sanders aren't the only actors to narrate the acclaimed Cross
  series, they certainly are among the finest. With a host of
  television appearances to his credit (Law &amp;amp; Order, Cosby)
  Massachusetts born Hernandez has also made his mark on Broadway
  in Jelly's Last Jam and The Merchant of Venice. His voice has a
  tad of huskiness, which makes it all the more appealing as Cross.
  In all, Fernandez has been featured in almost 12 of the Alex

  one another as they bring one of the most compelling Cross

  again to how Cross lost his beloved wife, Maria - she was shot
  down before his eyes. Her killer was never found; the case
  chalked off as another sick drive-by shooting. Now, Cross has
  returned to being a psychologist, his children are thriving, and
  perhaps he may be able to love someone again. However, a
  telephone call from John Sampson, his old partner, changes all
  that. Sampson wants Cross's help in finding a psychopathic serial
  rapist on the loose in Georgetown. Of course, Cross can't say no
  but little did he realize that this investigation would lead him
  to a tie-in to Maria's death some years ago. One more rapid paced
  thriller from the amazing pen of James Patterson read by two
  consummate voice performers. - Gail Cook</Text>

  <Text category="book">Frazee's comical "Guide for Babies of All
  Ages" has a subconscious message behind the humor, meanwhile
  encouraging those first few steps that will open up a universe of
  new experiences, baby leaving the shelter of the familiar for the
  unknown. The roly-poly baby illustrated is tiny compared to
  everything around him, objects taller than him, but once he pulls
  himself up and begins that first, tentative journey, it is
  impossible to stop. Of course, there are a few cautions along the
  way, "be careful of things that are wobbly; stay away from
  fragile stuff". There are the usual setbacks, too-much too-soon
  and a tumble to the floor, followed by a howl and the effort to
  being again. Cleverly worded and cheerfully illustrated, this
  tongue-in-cheek guide is a delight, offering more food for
  thought than is first apparent. Luan Gaines/ 2006.</Text>
  <Text category="book">Trauma can occur for a wide variety of
  reasons. In my family across two generations there have been
  suicides, schitzophrenia, abandonment and childhood abuse. We are
  a, so called, 'normal' middle class family. No family is immune

  and helpful. His outline of the causes of medical trauma are
  particularly interesting. The chapters dealing with trauma in

  overuse required it be replaced. We certainly couldn't be without
  a copy! Since then, this book is always included whenever I give
  gifts to new parents. The book is the touchy-feely type so the
  child explores the soft fur of the bunny, Daddy's scratchy beard,
  etc. The only times I hesitated buying it for a new baby was once

  <Text category="book">Great Speeches by Native Americans is the
  model of simplicity. Though edited by Bob Blaisdell, who
  presumably provides the single-paragraph introductions, the bulk
  of the book is simply the spoken words of Native Americans from
  the time of first contact in North America to the present day.
  Their messages speak for themselves. A number of themes and
  characteristics run through these selections. One is their
  brevity. The speakers get to the point and make it clearly. Few
  inclusions run longer than five pages. There is also a level of
  genuine (and often sad) honesty. Many selections concern the loss
  of tribal lands and the American Indians' efforts to hold onto
  them or gain just compensation, if such a thing was possible at
  the time. The tone is often one of resignation, but also of
  appeal to the better nature of their listeners. It is not
  possible to say if these speeches were carefully selected for
  this editorial theme or not, but it appears that for several
  centuries the native peoples viewed, rightly or wrongly, the
  European and later American entry into the continent as something
  that words and argument and demonstrated moral behavior could
  combat. Even among the surrender speeches of various tribal
  chiefs we see the notion that no speaker could really understand
  what their people could have done differently to avoid such
  conflicts. The style could almost be considered anti-oratorical,
  though the simple approach is here elevated to a style of its
  own. One should probably consider that many of these speeches are
  translated into English. Nonetheless, the organization of thought
  and prioritization of points shows a group of people, separated
  by years, language, and geography who retain a clear-headed means
  of addressing their listeners</Text>
  <Text category="book">Set in Venice at the end of World War II,
  Hemingway tells a romantic and touching story of the love affair
  between a gruff 50 year old American colonel and Renata, a young
  and very pretty Italian contessa. Loss is a recurring theme--the
  death of many of the Colonel's subordinates in combat, the
  break-up of his earlier marriage to a career woman, and the
  severe injury to one of the Colonel's hands from which he suffers
  constant pain. The Colonel may also be dying and his time left
  with his young lover may be very short. What gives the novel so
  much poignancy and resonance is the great devotion Renata and the
  Colonel have for one another. Renata seeks to comfort the Colonel
  and implores him to relate to her the worst of his combat
  experiences so that he may relieve some of his bitterness. The
  Colonel lovingly calls Renata, "daughter." Hemingway tells this
  tale in the deceptively simple, direct, and matter of fact style
  for which he is justly celebrated. I could have done without the
  duck hunting sequences and some of the Colonel's more obvious
  macho behavior, but Hemingway, being Hemingway, understandably
  could not. This is a lovely and sad story, filled with the
  yearnings of its two lead characters</Text>
  <Text category="book">I saw the movie in a theater when it first
  came out. I was a teenager and, although I believed it to be
  primarily a girl's movie, I did enjoy it. I've seen it several
  times since then, and it still has not lost its charm. When I
  finally did read the book, I was disappointed that the movie
  didn't follow it more closely. To me, these are two different
  stories. The Holly in the movie is likeable; the novella's Holly
  is a harpie who cares for no one or nothing else. (When my wife
  saw the movie, she remarked that Holly was, "an idiot.") However,
  the book's storyline is more interesting...more haunting, and the
  book's ending is more intriguing. The movie ends as a love story.
  The book is much more. And, oh yes, whatever you may think of
  Capote as an individual, the guy was a damn good writer</Text>
  <Text category="book">Always lively and perspicacious, this
  clever book seeks to solve a seemingly trivial puzzle: while
  historians have mustered a host of plausible explanations
  (weapons, diseases, horses, etc.) for why Europeans spread so
  thickly into North America, Australia, New Zealand and Argentina
  (the lands Crosby labels "Neo-Europes"), what could possibly
  explain why the dandelion did so as well? The question doesn't
  appear so innocuous when it is pointed out that not just the
  dandelion, but the European housefly, and feral pigs, and a horde
  of other weeds, pests, crops, diseases and livestock from Europe
  followed suit. Quite often these organisms, even the domesticated
  ones, raced ahead of European explorers themselves, rapidly
  proliferating into vast herds and stands that the settlers
  themselves could not fathom. Why was this so? Why didn't, say,
  Australian weeds, their seeds inadvertently shipped back to
  England, eventually carpet the meadows and fields of Europe? To
  answer this odd question, Professor Crosby begins his story with
  Pangaea--the great supercontinent that began to split apart about
  200 million years ago into the continents we now have scattered
  about the globe. These "seams of Pangaea" then forced a radical
  divergence in the terrestrial flora and fauna of the planet, and
  set the stage for the equally radical convergence initiated when
  European mariners crossed these now mid-oceanic seams. Crosby
  details case after case in each category: weeds, pests,
  livestock, diseases and crops. He forcefully illustrates how
  sudden and overwhelming the ecosystem takeover was until the
  suspense is too much to bear. What is the answer? He drops clues
  every now and then, and the most explicit one is in the form of a
  quote that begins one of the final chapters: if weeds are to be
  defined as those organisms that thrive on the disturbances caused
  by humans, then humans themselves must be considered the primary
  weed of all. Here, then is the answer: all the opportunistic
  fellow-travelers of the European diaspora are exquisitely
  coadapted to the scale and pace of the continuous ecological
  disequilibrium characteristic of the Old World civilizations--and
  they, in turn, furthered and helped generate that very
  disequilibrium. Together--humans, horses, cattle, pigs, rats,
  clover, peaches, measles and, yes, dandelions--comprised a potent
  self-replicating system, dimly discerned by its contemporaries,
  that could not be stopped once it spilled across the seams of
  Pangaea</Text>

  <Text category="book">This is one of the best business books I've
  ever read. Mr. Nocera says it took him six years to write this
  book, and I believe it. The amount of work that went into this
  book is obvious. This is an excellent piece of business
  journalism. The annotations and bibliography are thorough, and
  the overall writing and editing is top notch. Mr. Nocera covers a
  rich array of elements important to the development of the
  financial services industry over the last half of the 20th
  century: - Automated Teller Machines (ATMs) - The BankAmericard
  (later VISA) - Outdated banking regulations - Black Monday,
  October 19, 1987 - Jimmy Carter's futile attempts to wrestle
  runaway inflation in the late 1970's - Cash Management Accounts
  (CMAs) - Citibank (later Citicorp) - Deregulation of brokers'
  commissions - Growth of American consumer debt as a result of
  runaway inflation in the late 1970's - America's cultural
  adoption of the plastic credit card from the late 1950's through
  1993 - The direct marketing of credit cards to Americans and its
  great success - America's worship of star mutual fund managers
  like Peter Lynch during the 1980's - The ineptitude of America's
  elected officials to deregulate the banking industry in the face
  of dramatic changes in the financial services marketplace - The
  amazing impact money market mutual funds had on Americans'
  savings strategies given the inflexibility of the banking
  Regulation Q that capped savings deposit interest at around 5%
  while interest rates were as high as 16%+ in the early 1980's -
  The significant growth and influence of Fidelity Investments and
  its leader Ned Johnson on the industry in the 1980's - Individual
  Retirement Accounts (IRAs) and their impact on the growing wealth
  of Americans - The rise of nonbank banks and other non-financial
  companies getting into the financial services arena during the
  1970's and 1980's - The pervasive impact and presence that Andrew
  Kahr had throughout the industry in creating new financial
  services products - The pollyana-ish impact of Marshall Loeb,
  editor of Money magazine, had on "middle class" Americans and
  their views of investing in securities - The amazing record of
  Peter Lynch despite the ever-growing size of the Magellan Fund -
  The slowness of Merrill Lynch to change along with the rest of
  the industry in de-emphasizing commission revenue versus asset
  management fees - The dramatic growth of mutual funds in the
  later half of the 20th century and all the billions the financial
  services industry makes from them each year - Negotiable Order of
  Withdrawal (NOW) accounts - State laws on usury and how South
  Dakota became the credit card capital of America - Schwab's
  OneSource as the first 'mutual fund supermarket' - The dramatic
  risks of writing naked put options in 1987 just before Black
  Monday and how it impacted Charles Schwab &amp;amp; Co. - The
  impact of "Reagonomics" on American wealth-building - The 1980's
  bull market leading up to Black Monday - The wild success of
  First Deposit's First Select card as designed by Andrew Kahr and
  the adverse reaction to it by consumers and watchdog groups -
  Paul Volcker's anti-inflation policy of ratcheting up interest
  rates in the early 1980's and his general resistance to
  deregulation of the banking industry - Ted and Nina Wang's
  amazing margin calls during and after Black Monday The author
  does a great job of depicting the very interesting characters
  that led the money revolution in the later half of the 20th
  century, including Dee Hock of VISA, Ned Johnson of Fidelity,
  Peter Lynch of Fidelity, Andrew Kahr the product development
  consultant, Roger Lawson of Fidelity, Marshall Loeb of Money
  magazine, Charles Merrill of Merrill Lynch, President Jimmy
  Carter and his administration, Donald Regan of Merrill Lynch and
  the Reagan administration, Charles Schwab, Gerald Tsai Jr. of
  Fidelity, Paul Volcker of the Federal Reserve, and Walter Wriston
  and John Reed of Citibank. The writing is crisp, clear, and easy
  to read. Few books come out like this and Mr. Nocera is to be
  commended for this first rate work. If you are even mildly
  interested in any of the items listed above, you will enjoy this
  book. If you find the financial services industry fascinating
  and/or work in the industry, you will love this book. It's a page
  turner! The only drawback to this book is that it was published
  over a decade ago in 1994. So much has happened since then! I
  encourage Mr. Nocera to pick up where he left off and put out a
  second edition that takes his readers up through 2005.</Text>

  <Text category="book">The subject provided a good historical

  revered as a god, a god without power. This Sword Saint was a man
  of great prowess with a sword of wood or of steel; he was also an
  artist, a lithographer and an author. Yet, he was masterless,
  masterless in a time when righteous was measured in a retainer's

  <Text category="book">Overall, I think this is a very good book
  for someone who is trying to turn their health habits around, but
  is overwhelmed by all of the possibilities. It also a good track
  to run on for someone who wants to implement important life
  changes in an easy step-wise fashion. There is nothing fanatical
  about the recommendations and they can be easily implemented by
  almost anyone. One of the things I most like about this book is
  the encouraging tone and the prioritization of various changes
  that are made little-by-little in eating habits, exercise, etc.
  This book recommends walking as the main source of exercise and
  gives some great arguments for why this makes sense. I think
  there are also some good and simple nutritional guidelines e.g.
  eliminated trans fatty acids, eating more fiber, using more olive
  oil, etc. Mixed in with some well researched conclusions are Dr.
  Weil's opinions. For example, he recommends a fairly simple
  supplementation regimen. While it is true that not everything he
  says is necessarily supported by corresponding studies, it is
  also probably that some of it is on the mark, but the data is not
  all in or all of the variables are not possible to isolate. At
  the least, I don't see where this level of supplementation would
  do harm to most people. I also like that Dr. Weil takes a
  holistic approach to health. He not only looks at and talks about
  the body. He also addressed stress and relaxation, life attitudes
  and other ingredients of a healthy life that impact on health.
  While he is very commercial, he is also a Harvard trained
  physician and I do think that he has some very good insights to
  share. While in some ways I think this book can be better. I
  would still recommend it to almost anyone, especially people who
  are intimidated by the idea of exercising and changing their life
  habits. While not every suggestion might be on target, I am sure
  that if someone implemented ALL the suggestions over eight weeks,
  they would undergo a big positive change in the state of their
  health. I have certainly found this to be true and I cheat on
  some of them ;</Text>

  <Text category="book">At first, I found this book to be difficult
  to digest because it appeared to be heading in a direction that
  was in sacrilegious conflict with my beliefs as a Christian and a
  catechist in the Catholic Church. Yet a part of me was also
  highly fascinated and captivated by the story, especially since I
  work as a mental health professional. As I keep reading, I
  discovered that it wasn't sacrilegious at all but rather a story
  of general faith and hope, of the extent a mother would go
  through to protect her child, and of the intrusive nature of the
  media. I particularly liked the strength Mariah showed during
  this conflict, despite her past history of nervous breakdown. And
  I like the way the character of Ian evolved from a sleazy
  teleaetheist to a caring and more moral man. The secondary
  characters were all wonderful, in particular Mariah's mother and
  the lawyers on both side. I thought the trial was once of the
  most interesting parts of the story. As with all Picoult books,
  this was a deep and heavy novel which wasn't easily breezed
  through, but it was definitely a compelling and awesome book to
  read!</Text>

  unnecessarily long. The authors were meticulous in explaining
  everything about the deal and those involved - from the history
  to every single meeting and telephone conversation. The two
  authors never mentioned whether they were present during every
  conversation or not, but did an incredible job at recreating all
  that happened nonetheless. For someone interested in pursuing a

  <Text category="book">Noah Webster's book is fascinating reading
  for today's students and teachers alike, as well as for the
  average citizen, as there is much to learn from it. While it may
  be inappropriate to resurrect it as an official school text, it
  certainly has a place in every school library. One of the most
  notable features is the comprehensive phonetic system used, with
  diacritical marks (accents) applied to all relevant vowels and
  consonants; words are divided according to syllables and stress.
  It also spells the names of letters of the alphabet; something
  which tends to be ignored in modern teaching. The terminology of
  traditional grammar is used, and there are copious word lists,
  with words grouped according to common factors. I have no
  hesitation in recommending this book to all students of the
  English language for the above reasons and for many other
  interesting aspects (now-archaisms:thy/thou...; foreign words and
  phrases; abbreviations explained; punctuation; etc). This book
  should remain a spelling classic</Text>
  <Text category="book">Thankfully, this is NOT littered with
  platitudes and meaningless anaologies, the hallmarks of 99% of
  the latest-and-greatest business books. Especially since it was
  written in 1999, Moore's is an incredibly insightful and
  prophetic book on strategy for the high-tech industry. He was
  predicting cutting edge changes then that are coming into reality
  today in 2005. The book is much more descriptive than
  prescriptive though, and is best used as a tool to instigate
  discussions about corporate strategy, rather than as a checklist
  for strategic implementation. I help run an online software
  development company and although it isn't exactly "high tech" I
  still found the vast majority of it very helpful and the rest of
  it fascinating. Market shifts are demanding broadband wireless
  Internet everywhere--free. Companies are shifting towards
  web-basing software applications. All very relevant to my
  business. The book is well written, an easy and moderately fast
  read, and very accessible by anyone who is technology-savvy
  enough to at least hold an email address. Yes, buy it. Buy the
  paperback and save money. Short Synopsis: In the infancy of a
  market, products need to be highly tailored to meet the
  psychological and technical needs of leading edge techno-geeks;
  nothing new here. When a company wants to take that product and
  make it marketable to the middle majority--where the biggest
  money sits--it requires a commitment to discipline and shift its
  strategy in order to do so. The emphasis shifts intially to
  identifying a single niche segment and creating a comprehensive,
  tailored product, that meets all of their needs--create the
  "whole product" by using partners and 3rd party services to
  patchwork the thing together. Then, stop tweaking the product. If
  that works, pick related niches and go after them the same way,
  creating the "whole product" for each of them. Once people at
  large are comfortable enough to make the paradigm shift for that
  market (this all deals with new, high-tech changes) and start
  doing so en masse, the strategy must completely shift again to a
  ship-first / fix-the-product-later mentality in a mad, market
  share scramble. At this phase, you are "In the Tornado." Lots of
  examples of successful and abysmal strategies used by high tech
  companies whose names are familiar to everyone, at each stage
  mentioned above.</Text>
  <Text category="book">It doesn't sound like the people you list
  as reasons "not" to read this book, actually read "this" book.
  There is a big difference, in my opinion, of putting positive
  affirmations in your mind, versus a witch doctor. And quite
  honestly, it seems the positive affirmations could and should be
  used in "conjuction" with medical care. Does it say anywhere in
  the book to forego medical care, because you will most definitely
  be healed? No where. So in my opinion, one has to have a "sound"
  mind, and not view the book as a "cure all" for all the ills in
  life, but rather a positive way to "enhance" your life. It is
  just plain stupid to to avoid getting medical care, when you have
  a terminal illness, or any other illness for that matter. But
  according to what I gather from the book, you CAN use positive
  affirmations, and "believe" that you are getting well, to help
  keep yourself in a positive state, rather than filling your head
  with negative thinking that you will never get well. Studies
  aside from this book have PROVEN that a healthy and positive
  attitude and mental outlook, have done wonders for recovering
  patients, along with their medical care. Your review did not
  address any of those people that read this book, because the two
  examples of people you list, it is apparent they didn't read the
  book either, (not sure what compelled you to post here?)
  therefore you are not qualified, in my opinion, to critique this
  book, as they were using apparently some form of faith healing
  from a televangelist, did they prescribe drinking snakes blood,
  too? Anyway, this book in no way says to forgo medical treatment
  if you are sick, and those that do, probably won't be addressing
  their medical problem. Can the positive affirmations and power of
  suggestion help you through your medical crisis? I imagine it
  can, (studies prove it can) in addition to proper medical
  treatment. Anyway, you might want to actually read the book,
  instead of making comments of what happened to "so and so" who
  didn't even read it or apply it, including yourself.</Text>

  centers of the brain, but many sections cry out for a diagram
  among all the verbiage. Pinker's lively, humorous style is often
  commented on but I sometimes found it wearing. He will illustrate
  a point with an amusing newspaper cutting, then list a few more,
  then add "I could not resist some more..." and so on. I sometimes
  wished he would just get on with it. A major problem with his
  nativist approach, which other reviewers have commented on, is
  that many examples he lists of usages that English speakers would
  never employ are nothing of the kind. Most of them are
  conceivable and since the first publication of this book,
  linguists have been busy recording them in the field. The thesis
  also becomes somewhat unraveled in the penultimate chapter, where
  he argues that 'you and I' and 'you and me' are equally correct
  in all circumstances, because 'the pronoun is free to have any
  case it wants'. But if this is so then what has become of the
  innate awareness of correct usage that the whole theory is about?
  If 'between you and I' sounds instinctively wrong to me and
  'between you and me' sounds instinctively wrong to someone else,
  does that mean one of us has a mutant grammar gene? I doubt it.
  The title itself is problematic. 'Instinct' is not a word much in
  favor among biologists nowadays and whatever language is, it is
  certainly not instinctive in the traditional sense. Early in the
  book, Pinker admits as much, but determines to use the word
  anyway, a use that owes more to marketing than to science. Still,
  this is probably the best introductory linguistics text currently
  available. If you are new to linguistics, start here rather than
  with Chomsky, but please go on to read Geoffrey Sampson's work,
  perhaps starting with his website, to get an alternative view. As
  with most academic disputes, the answer no doubt lies somewhere
  in the middle. Since Chomsky's early work, the nativists have
  toned down their claims considerably, while their opponents have
  made concessions. On page 34 of this book, Pinker says, "No one
  has yet located a language organ or a grammar gene, but the
  search is on." More than a decade later, the search is still on.
  Good luck with that.</Text>
  <Text category="book">A well-researched look at aviation that
  reminded me of the novels of Nevil Shute. My favorite chapter was
  Friday Norton QA 11:50am. A perfect description of the working
  methods of a certain veteran TV newsman who just retired at age
  88. Of course there are plot holes. The heroine a single mom
  researching the cause of an air incident is in jeopardy from
  union thugs and has initially has guards. But as the jeopardy
  increases, the guards aren't there. No followup mention. What
  happened to them? Some vulgarity in language. But all in all, a
  great fun read.</Text>
  <Text category="book">I disagree with several of the reviews here
  which cite several specific points of contention as making the
  book entirely worthless. I think it easily earns 4.5 - 5 stars.
  It IS over a decade old now, and I don't think it is intended as
  a source for scholars of English. But, for the amateur linguist
  and even the wannabe linguist it is a great read. I can't compete
  with some of the above reviewer's scholarly points, but I don't
  think replacing some of Bryson's dogma with their own is
  worthwhile. Mother Tongue is a great starting point and very
  educational. "Bryson's Dictionary of Troublesome Words" is also a
  great introduction and gets 5 stars from me.</Text>
  <Text category="book">I read Desperation and enjoyed it immensely
  much like i did with The Regulators also. This book is filled
  with suspense from page one. The book never drags in my opinion.
  This book though is not for the faint of heart. If you don't
  enjoy high body counts and gore then you will not like this book
  and will most likely put it down by the second chapter. But if
  you don't mind it at all like me you will enjoy the suspense he
  gives you and the twists and turns this book takes. The ending is
  by far the most suspenseful part. I also recommend reading
  Desperation first because you will probably understand it better
  and get a better look on what Tak is all about. The journal
  entries and newspaper articles are a very nice touch to the story
  and it lets you understand what is going on alot better also. I
  wish there was a part three to this but sadly there isn't. I
  can't choose between Desperation and Regulators because their
  both great but The Regulators does have the more suspenseful end
  to it. Although it is alot bloodier and may you even get a brief
  lump in your throat like i did when a tragic thing happens in the
  end. Keep up the good work King</Text>
  <Text category="book">I DEDICATE THIS Review TO WOMEN ALL AROUND
  THE WORLD OF ALL COLOUR,RACES,RELIGIONS,NATIONALITY AND
  CREED...(ALL WOMEN ARE EQUAL,IN MY EYES....Nigel..) In this
  remarkable novel,SK makes his debut.An unlikely but good book.It
  has a good dose of horror/suspense and it is one of the best
  books I have ever read... It is simply about a teenager from
  Maine,named Carietta White(Carrie).From the beginning of the
  story we see who her mother(Margaret white)takes advantage of
  her,making her feel stupid and left out.Similiarly in
  school,Carrie is always the "Black sheep",she has not friends and
  she is always picked upon.She is very unusual and strange,at
  least to most people,especially the ones in the book(story).(but
  I would say quite frankly that I didn't see here as anybody but a
  normal healthy teenage girl.) At the beginning of the story we
  also see that Carrie has her first period while taking a shower
  at school.She is laughed at and all the other girls throw toilet
  paper and tampons at her.This is her first big humiliation.(I am
  a guy,I know not much about a period,so please forgive my use of
  the term openly) Anyway,back to the plot:Carrie soon realizes
  that she is Psychic.She starts to practice using her powers
  gradually.It seems as though she had the powers since birth,but
  the powers were dormant until puberty or at least she was unaware
  of it. So,so far we see this:a very unusual girl with psychic
  powers and a stupid mother. The story initially and mostly
  circulates around these facts but things get a little messy
  towards the middle and end. Allow me..... It is later revealed in
  the story that the psychic gift is sort of genetic.Carrie's
  mother explains alot of things,but she is still a bad mother.
  (but I still can't hate carries's mother,because most mothers are
  sort of protective over their children) Soon Carrie gets her
  first friend Sue.Sue feels sorry for Carrie and helps her to get
  a date for the prom. This date is Tommy Ross... Meanwhile,one of
  the bad girls,Chris,is unable to attend the prom.So,she sets up a
  nasty revenge against Carrie.Believe me when I tell you,Chris is
  a very jealous girl and if she can't have something,no one else
  can,especially Carrie. So Chris arranges a trap for Carrie.(Two
  buckets of pig blood) She sets it up for the pig blood to fall on
  Carrie's and Tommy's head while at the prom... The plan
  eventually succeeds. Tommy is badly injured. Drenched in pig's
  blood,Carrie is laughed at,for the last time.She runs out of the
  building.She then remembers her psychic powers and decides to use
  it for revenge. She starts to close all the doors.She then turns
  on all the water sprinklers,wetting everyone. But with a
  combination of water and electricity(from the appliances)....some
  were electrocuted. Eventually a fire gets started.And things
  start to burn! She walks toward her home,burning everything
  within a certain radius of her powers. When she reaches home her
  mother tries to kill her,telling her that she is the spawn of
  satan.She eventually uses her powers to stop her mothers' heart
  beat,killing her. Eventually(this is the good part of the
  book),while Carrie is walking on the streets(going I don't know
  where)she seens Chris and Chris's boyfriend driving towards
  her,to bounce her. Carrie uses her powers to diverge to
  car,killing Chris and her stupid boyfriend. Sue eventually
  catches up with Carrie.Carrie doesn't kill her because she
  realizes that it wasn't Sue's falt but Chris's. (During the
  battle with her mother,Carrie was stabbed,I forgot to mention
  it,sorry.) So,now,talking with sue Carrie eventually breathes her
  last breath and speaks her last words and just,dies.(this is the
  sad part,I guarantee you that it would bring tears to your
  eyes,or maybe not) But this book is definitely good,I recommend
  it with all my "Psychic" powers. Enjoy.............This review

  believe what the 1 Star writers are saying. They don't want you
  to know the truth! The Left claims that Bin Laden would never

  adamant that Osama bin Laden was funded by the United States. Go

  <Text category="book">Hard to figure why Sean Stewart isn't one
  of the most beloved writers in America, given the virtuoso
  performance he's demonstrated here and the remarkably sympathetic
  character he's created in Will Kennedy. A combination
  horror/fantasy work which is as reminiscent of A Confederacy of
  Dunces as it is Ghosts, by Hynd, this novel is filled with so
  much warmth and life that it's hard to remember that this
  actually is a story about a man who understands that the past,
  too, can be a ghost, and perhaps the worst kind. Perfect Circle
  is everything every other supposed 5-star horror novel featured
  on Amazon is supposed to be: well-written, compelling, with rich,
  empathetic characters and a driving force and tension all its
  own. It's a wonderful introduction to Mr. Stewart's work</Text>

  understand, use and remember the "BE's". It does not anti with

  <Text category="book">I've skimmed a number of popular books
  published in the last few years on the problem of sexless
  marriage, and this is by far most interesting contribution to
  date. First, there is no recommendations for drug therapy
  anywhere in the book. Second, the author frequently brings into
  the discussion a European-influenced view of some particularly
  American style predilictions and assumptions reguarding sex,
  parenthood, gender politics, and relationship expectations. Her
  fundamental premise is that eroticisim requires seprateness, and
  in the course of building and sustaining security, we can
  frequently lose the "me" and "you" in us. But even more
  important, she sees the very contemporary marital impulse toward
  an egalitarian union -- while great for chores and child care --
  can be a neutralizer in the bedroom. You may or may not find
  strands of your own dilemma in her case histories, but you will
  not walk away from them empty handed, either. There are many
  aspects of the book which are highly nuanced, and won't survive
  well in the O'Reilly world of broadcast media interviews. I can
  just hear some producer-fed talking head asking something like,
  "You advocate couples go to Vegas for swinging? Why?" (She
  doesn't). So don't pay attention to that noise. This is an
  intellegent, respectful, contemplative work of original thinking
  that confronts a subject too often approached with superlatives
  and pabulum. Buy one for yourself and one for your best friend --
  more than likely, they're suffering, too</Text>
  <Text category="book">This book depicts the essence of the

  <Text category="book">First published in 1936, this is the 12th
  Poirot book, the 3rd Superintendent Battle book, and the 2nd
  Colonel Race book, and has no narrator. It's the first case in
  which Superintendent Battle, Mrs. Oliver, or Col. Race appear
  together with Poirot or each other, and the only case in which
  *all* do so at once. The story opens at an exhibition of
  snuffboxes, where Poirot encounters Mr. Shaitana, a collector
  with a catty manner and a knack for gossip. Shaitana deliberately
  cultivates a Mephistopholean pose, which at first makes him seem
  like the potential quarry in the case - but it becomes clear that
  he's a victim waiting to happen. For Shaitana, like a few other
  collectors in Christie's universe, has succumbed to a foolish
  temptation, and begun collecting *people* - and not just people
  of talent or genius, but murderers. And being a connoisseur, he
  collects only the best: those who have gotten away with it. He
  amuses himself on this occasion by boasting to Poirot of his
  hobby, without naming names, and inviting him to a little supper
  party to meet his collection of "tigers" (Poirot having just
  pointed out that he himself could admire a tiger, but would do so
  from outside the tiger's cage, having respect for the danger.)
  Poirot accepts the supper invitation, however, to find that there
  are seven other guests, including the three other detectives as
  well as four guests who are presumably the murderers: explorer
  Major Despard, a strong silent type; Mrs. Lorrimer, a middle-aged
  widow who is *very* serious about bridge; timid young Anne
  Meredith; and Dr. Roberts, a loud and jovial general
  practitioner. Shaitana drops hints referring to four possible
  methods of murder, but otherwise the subject does not come up,
  and the guests proceed to play bridge after supper - arising from
  the final game to find their host dead, stabbed sitting beside
  the fire in full view of the players! This is, of course,
  Poirot's fantasy case, as he once remarked in THE ABC MURDERS -
  because there is no tangible evidence against any one person more
  than another. There are only the people themselves, and their
  memories of the evening, and the bridge scores reflecting how the
  evening progressed. Solving the case depends entirely on being
  able to understand the people involved. But how to get them to
  reveal their true selves to an interrogator - or to uncover the
  crimes that Shaitana believed they'd committed and gotten away
  with? Rather than following Poirot's viewpoint in third person
  throughout, some chapters follow Battle, Race, or Mrs. Oliver as
  they conduct their own enquiries into the case. Each represents a
  different style: Battle is a professional police officer, Race an
  empire-builder-type secret agent, and Mrs. Oliver a writer of
  detective stories. Battle, of course, has a duty to investigate
  Shaitana's murder, and does so in an orthodox style, cultivating
  an image of plodding hard work that tempts one to underestimate
  him. Race deals with checking out Major Despard, the explorer
  who's most clearly his kind of person. Mrs. Oliver, for her part,
  works on worming information out of not only Anne Meredith, but
  her roommate Rhonda (whose attitude is that Anne could've lived
  like a duchess for the rest of her life on blackmail if she'd
  been paying attention). And, of course, there's Poirot. He's
  really fascinating to watch in this one as he interacts with each
  suspect in turn, pursuing two major lines of questioning: (1)
  Describe how the bridge games played out, and (2) Describe the
  scene of the murder (the elaborate collector's room in Shaitana's
  house where the bridge games were played). See if you can figure
  out where Poirot's questions lead before he reveals his reasoning
  to his colleagues, and what he learned from the responses he
  received</Text>

  appreciate what a fantastic collection of art, both colour and
  black and white, has been compiled into this collection. But it's

  <Text category="book">The purpose of Nessus is to provide an Open
  Source Solution for network auditing on all Unix like systems.
  This book not only details using Nessus but also comes with a CD
  containing the program, as well as Ethereal, Snort, and Newt (a
  port of the program to the Windows environment). What is a
  network assessment? At its basic level it is an attempt to detect
  a live system and then identify the computing environment,
  services, applications, and vulnerabilities on that system.
  Basically there are two types of assessment - internal and
  external. An internal assessment is done over the local network
  and external is done from outside the LAN. Nessus will do both
  types and the book details how to do either, or both of them. The
  authors do an excellent job of detailing installation, setup, and
  how to interpret the results of a scan as well as various factors
  that can affect the report. One of the parts not to be missed is
  the discussion of not only the benefits but also the potential
  problems of scanning your system. Some of the vulnerability types
  scanned for include buffer overflows, default passwords,
  backdoors, information leaks, and denial of service. The Nessus
  scripting language is covered in detail in Appendix A instead of
  the main portion of the book; a choice I appreciated very much as
  it allowed the flow of the book to not be interrupted by such a
  highly technical section. With Open Source products there
  generally is no organized technical support phone number you can
  call of help. So, the authors include information on how to get
  help via the Nessus User Community, mailing lists, and archives.
  Nessus Network Auditing is a highly recommended book for anyone
  interested in auditing their network to find potential problems
  before they become reality</Text>
  <Text category="book">Eoghan Casey's text is immediately useful.
  It's not theory, it's practical. It's not biased to one operating
  system, but covers several technologies. Finally, Eoghan and the
  book's contributors do not gloss over today's most offensive
  topics, they address them with vigor and solutions. I would share
  one concern: the chapter-long product/vendor discussion. Some
  reviewers label it marketing; other reviewers don't mention it at
  all. I'll just forewarn you that you will learn much more about
  EnCase or NFR than about their competitors. As a security
  consultant for Hewlett-Packard, it seems my bookshelf fills up
  entirely too easily, especially as of the last few years.
  Therefore, I've gotten fairly selective with new book purchases
  (until I can get a new bookshelf). However, Casey's text is
  DEFINITELY worth getting - worth knocking another book off to
  make room. :) I hope you enjoy this comprehensive text at least
  half as much as I do</Text>
  <Text category="book">Did you ever know someone whose life was
  just "perfect" ?? Someone who went to college, got married at age
  23, found a great job with valuable stock options... Someone who
  settled down in a house in a nice city at age 25 or 26, started a
  family a year or two later, and who now seems to "Have it All" ??
  Well, after World War II, this happened to JUST ABOUT EVERYONE in
  the Silent Generation, and it happen to MOST in the boomer
  generation, and it's happening to JUST ABOUT NO ONE in Generation
  X. This books speaks to members of Generation X and describes the
  suffering and coping mechanisms for these people. This book, now
  15 years, is about a generation that was sold down the river by
  its elders - Generation X. The book describes 3 young people,
  Andy, Dag, and Claire, who visit palm springs and tell stories of
  their lives and of their friends who are suffering in life. The
  author Douglas Coupland is actually telling stories from
  Vancouver British Columbia, one of the first cities in North
  America to be sold out to foreign economic colonizers from Hong
  Kong (who escaped to Vancouver to avoid the 1997 mainland
  takeover.) In this city, the worst 1100 square foot fixer-upper
  house costs a third of a million dollars, or 10 years of
  take-home pay for a mid-career household. Economic success is
  impossible in the physical confines of the city - the system is
  rigged against everyone except rich immigrants and the existing
  upper class of blue-collar boomers who purchased homes in the
  1970's and 1980's. Many aspects of the book (such as "Reverse
  Sabbatical", "McJobs", etc.) reflect the severe economic
  conditions faced by high-achieving intellectuals who go nowhere
  economically in that city. In my grandparents generation, all you
  had to do was to go to college. In my parent's generation, you
  needed to go to college and become a successful professional. In
  my own generation, you need to co-found a startup company and be
  among the 10% of founders who can sell off the company or have an
  IPO. Do you notice something here? Yes, it's getting more and
  more difficult to be marginally successful in America. Because
  Gen X'ers find that traditional paths to success - hard work,
  taking chances, saving and investing - don't work any more, they
  resolve to live like their parents by either living WITH THEIR
  PARENTS or by borrowing money endlessly and hoping for a miracle.
  Fiscal irresponsibility is at an all-time high, and has
  squandered everyone's future! In this environment of perpetual
  economic slavery, Coupland counsels Generation X'ers to break
  free of the traditional career models that have been rigged by
  their elders for failure. Coupland counsels us all to re-examine
  what is success in our life and how to achieve it. This book is a
  call to enlist in a class warfare between gen-X'ers and their
  elders! In many ways, this book is similar to "The Razor's Edge"
  by W. Somerset Maughen or "The Monk and the Riddle: The Art of
  Creating a Life While Making a Living", in other words, redefine
  your notion of success in the world, while waiting for our evil
  society to implode in upon itself, which must surely happen in
  the near future ..</Text>

  <Text category="book">I was a little wary about the title but
  this was not at all about weight gain and/or loss; weight was
  incidental. In this fiercely intelligent novel, Dorothy and
  Justine are both desperately lonely women, both victims of abuse,
  and yet are different in other ways. Their parents often failed
  them, their childhood was often full of shame and self-sabotage,
  but Gaitskill writes this with complexity, always aware that a
  victim can also be a victimizer. Gaitskill is never sentimental.
  Underneath her narrative, underneath the pain and the sex scenes
  (which are never fully loving) and the disappointments and
  loneliness, is a raging anger at the inability of human beings to
  connect - on race, on class, but mostly on gender. I sensed that
  Anna Granite, the intellectual whose shadow dominates this
  narrative, and who is the reason Dorothy and Justine first meet,
  is Gaitskill's platform for displaying her keen intellect; and
  sometimes there is a hint of didactism. But this is a minor
  quibble. The last section moved me very much and proved that
  although Gaitskill abhors sentimentality, she can certainly do
  sentiment well. `Humanity' is a word often found in this book.
  Our sexuality is connected to our humanity. Our ability to treat
  other human beings like human beings is what makes us human. In
  the end, Gaitskill's brilliant, wonderfully feminist novel was,
  for me, about how easily we strip each other of our
  humanity.</Text>

  <Text category="book">Like most of the reviewers, i went into
  this book expecting the humor and absurdity of the website. And
  it's all there, in it's ridiculous glory. However, this book is
  almost like two books in one. Upon reading the footnotes a much
  deeper tale begins to unfold. Beyond the nonsensical ramblings of
  Robert, the book tells a tale of a lonely kid using ninjas as an
  escape from his sad life. His parents hate him, he has no
  friends, and nobody else listens to him, except his babysitter

  <Text category="book">This book, "The Relatives Came" by Cynthia
  Rylant and illustrated by Stephen Gammell, was a delight to read.
  I found myself smiling as I read the words that made the artwork
  come alive. Likewise, I found myself recollecting over the
  memories of the past when my relatives would come to visit. And,
  I felt as if I, too, were a part of this book. Having experienced
  growing up in a small town where you don`t see that many people,
  I believe that when relatives come to visit, it almost seems like
  Christmas. As a result, when the book expressed the joy,
  laughter, and celebration of family, it stirred up these memories
  of the past. Unquestionably, almost anyone, from children to
  adults, could find themselves reminiscing and longing for the fun
  they had when their relatives come to visit.</Text>
  <Text category="book">Firstly, I have not seen the film
  adaptation of 'Single White Female' and so this review isn't
  tainted one way or the other. This book, about the stolen
  identity of a young woman by her psychotic flatmate, is written
  is very easy style. Characterizations, prose, and dialogue are
  all straightforward. I can understand why a film was made based
  on it since the book reads more like a screenplay than a novel.
  And the book's "feel" is anything but original. 'Sliver' by Ira
  Levin does a better job of capturing the essence of life (and
  danger) in Manhattan for a single, white female. Still, 'Single
  White Female' is an entertaining read. Bottom line: a very
  enjoyable, suspenseful read that doesn't tax the brain.

  <Text category="book">Walzer's historical approach to examining
  just war theory is, I think, the most useful way to understand
  morality in war. That is so because empirical facts back up all
  the philosophical evaluations. Walzer describes experience and
  draws conslusions here; he is laying a philosophical foundation
  and implying, if not prescribing, moral norms from which the
  rules have been extracted. Be forewarned, he does not cut the
  reader any slack. This book requires some serious attention to
  the author's train of thought. Just war theory has two
  categories: the justice of going to war, and the justice of
  fighting once in a war. Walzer's discussion usefully and clearly
  separates the two and examines via historical events what we
  regard as right and wrong within each sphere. In doing this he
  has done the modern world a tremendous service. His logical
  breakdown speaks to thousands of years of tradition about what
  thinkers have considered right and wrong in war. One of the best
  outcomes of this landmark work is the complete debunking of the
  notion that "all is fair in love and war." That is the path of
  least moral resistance (or as Clausewitz would say, "friction"),
  yet we all know that soldiers are honored for fighting well and
  loathed for behaving like armed thugs and murderers. What is
  amazing from the discusion is the realization that Walzer knows
  he has to attack that age-old notion, something our collective
  sense of justice has historically always rejected. Yet it remains
  a prevailing idea for many. Originally coined by the Romans it
  seems (Walzer quotes them, "In war the laws are silent"), they
  themselves were self-consciously contrite over the fates they
  inflicted on the Greeks and Carthginians. The book rates five
  stars for rigorously addressing this issue alone. Some make the
  mistake of thinking Walzer is a pacifist--far from it. On the
  otherside some critics find his argument about "supreme
  emergency" a moral failure and a cop-out. The case of Nazi
  Germany is his paradigmatic case of supreme emergency, one where
  normal rules may be relaxed, if ever so little, because of the
  especially pernicious nature of state-sponsored genocide. The
  same relaxation of restraints would likely apply to Islamic
  terror. In contrast Walzer does not see Imperial Japan, for
  instance, as having represented a supreme emergency, and so the
  atomic bombings and the fire bombings of cities could not be
  morally justified. Readers may want to compare his view to Paul
  Fussell's perspective in the essay "Thank God for the Atom Bomb."
  Significantly for current events, readers interested in the
  distinction between pre-emptive and preventive war will find a
  well articulated argument here. The US attack on Iraq was and
  still is often justified as pre-emptive. That impulse on the part
  of the neo-conservatives who devised or whipped up the casus
  belli reflects, I think, a need to cloak a morally questionable
  war in the robes of legitimacy. There is no way that attack can
  be justified under the historically accepted norms of
  "pre-emption." Michael Walzer's well-thought distinction between
  pre-emption and prevention makes sense even in the milieu of
  asymmetric warfare against terror and Islamic radicalism, and it
  clearly shows why the Iraq war was a moral mistake from the
  start, regardless of its practical success down the road, if we
  are fortunate enough to see that. The moral precedent of engaging
  in preventive war will continue to haunt America long into the
  future. The fact that Iraq was not even on the spectrum where the
  fine line between pre-emption and prevention exists is a telling
  aspect of the overall ongoing strategic fiasco. Where one fails
  to recognize the moral high ground, one is doomed to moral
  failure. Walzer was vocal about the run-up to war in 2003, and
  those who read his book would do well to find his comments about
  the Iraq invasion; they are edifying in terms of understanding
  the overall argument and where we are going in this role as the
  world's police force</Text>
  <Text category="book">Malphurs does an excellent job of laying
  out the strategic planning process step by step and in great
  detail. I really appreciated the fact that he takes into account
  things like church patriarchs/matriarchs and other church
  dynamics that are often not addressed practically in ministry
  books. He almost makes the process seem easy, and maybe it is, IF
  you are starting a new church or are in the very early stages of
  a church plant. However, much of the material seems practically
  impossible to implement in a "plateau'ed" or "downward spiraling"
  church that has been around for 100 years. The principles are
  easy and make sense IF you have 100% support of the congregation.
  That's pretty hard to do in most of the churches I've been in
  that need strategic planning the most. That's no fault of
  Malphurs; the book itself is a great book</Text>
  <Text category="book">On a recommendation from a friend,
  Heimgest, DCG-OR, (who rarely recommends any book), we found this
  book to be one of the absolute best on the subject of our Gods

  Rydberg's and Grimm's Teutonic Mythology</Text>
  <Text category="book">This is a charming little book. It's very
  concise, profusely illustrated, and it covers the basic geometry
  of platonic and archimedean solids. It delightfully summarizes
  the work of Plato/Theaetetus, Archimedes, Euclid, Kepler, and
  Euler in only 57 pages, half of which contain only illustrations.
  As a model-builder who attaches no special religious significance
  to polyhedra, I was a little concerned when I looked at the other
  books in the series that this book might be about "sacred
  geometry." Fortunately (at least from my point of view) it does
  not contain a word about it, except for a cursory reference to
  the elements Plato associated with each of the Platonic Solids. A
  table at the end includes the dihedral and central angles and
  edge/radius ratios for all the platonic and archimedean
  solids--all the info a model builder needs! This book won't
  impress anyone with a mathematics background, but for a layman
  like me, it's a perfect introduction. Kudos to Sutton for putting
  this material in such an elegant and accessible format</Text>
  <Text category="book">In this book, Dulles offers a simplistic
  yet useful overview of the way the church has been viewed
  throughout its history. He focuses primarily on the Catholic
  church. From Dulles' analysis, there are five basic ways to
  understand the church. He explores how these models have been
  used over time, as well as their particular strengths and
  weaknesses. In the rest of the book, Dulles explores some of the
  issues surrounding ecclesiology. He has also added a new model
  which is a synthesis of the other five. My only complaint about
  the book is that it makes divisions too simple and
  straightforward. Rarely is there a church that fits all of the
  descriptions of one model or does not somehow combine several
  models. The book is helpful, however, to pastors who seek to
  understand the thought patterns of the members of their church.
  It is also helpful to congregants who desire to understand more
  fully what it means to be the church. All things considered, this
  book is an asset to pastors, students, and anyone involved in
  ministry</Text>

  <Text category="book">Dave Barry has written and selected an
  extremely humorous collection of his articles from The Miami
  Herald. There is a huge margin in difference of quality in
  Boogers are My Beat than in his initial non fiction books such as
  Dave Barry's Bad Habits. Boogers are My Beat is one of those rare
  books that once you start turning the pages you don't want to put
  down until the back cover. Dave Barry educates his fellow man on
  a diverse range of topics such as why you can't use the towels
  hanging in the bathroom, the Salt Lake City Olympics, babies on
  airlines, North Dakota, Bear in the Big Blue House and cell
  phones to name just a few. His article written the day after
  September 11 and one written a year after, about the Philadelphia
  crashed plane are also included which prove Barry could have been
  a serious writer if he had pursued that career. Thankfully he
  didn't because the rest of the book is hysterically funny as is
  his Carl Hiaasen style fiction novel Tricky Business. Big Trouble

  <Text category="book">Private eye Philip Marlowe is asked for
  help to get to Mexico by Terry Lennox. Marlowe likes Lennox and
  agrees to help him, but later Lennox commits suicide in the small
  Mexican town of Otatoclan. But why was Lennox driven to such
  extremes? Later on, Marlowe is asked for his assistance in
  keeping the alcoholic writer Roger Wade on the
  staight-and-narrow. This is not really Marlowe's line of work,
  but he becomes entangled in the case especially as connections
  with Lennox begin slowly to emerge. This is a longer, more
  ambitious novel by Chandler albeit displaying the same cynical,
  tough edge as the other Marlowe novels I've read. The greater
  length allows Chandler more space for character development and
  reflection. The danger of this is that the novel could have felt
  over-extended, but for me it didn't. The ending did not come as a
  total surprise, but as with every other Chandler novel I've read,
  enjoyment of the journey rather than satisfaction at the quality
  of the destination is the important thing. G Rodger</Text>

  explanation into early Christianity is wonderful. It is
  definitely worth the time to read this. She delves into the
  politics of the early church, the Passion, the resurrection, as
  well as the clashes between Gnostic and Orthodox thinking. Too
  often, we forget that what we call the canon is not the only
  writings available. She just reminds us that there is this whole
  other world of writings that did not make it into the bible for
  one reason or another. If you want to get an idea of who the

  what a long, fun ride it's been. Wordy, and a little confusing,
  this book has to be taken in the right mood, or else you'll miss
  the humor. The places that the main character travels to are
  memorable and exciting, and I found myself getting through a
  hefty portion, without thinking that I had ever started.
  Some....no, more like most of the satire is cryptic, and hard to
  find. However, I read up on the book, and it immediately popped
  out at me, and made alot more sense. This is an excellent book,

  <Text category="book">Truly the author's pen is mightier than the
  sword as he takes on Christmas, parents, children, evangelical
  Christians from Kentucky, television, Macy's, the result of a
  dalliance during the Viet Nam War, and "keeping up with the
  Joneses". This short book is much funnier than his best-selling
  "Me Talk Pretty Some Day" as the author's humorous cynicism is at
  its best. One can't put it down for fear of missing some insight
  into the American psyche. Three of the stories appear to be
  autobiographical (with obvious changes made to "protect the
  innocent") wherein the author "tells" the others in the guise of
  another. Regardless, Sedaris pulls no punches and will have the
  reader in stitches, even if there's a little guilt attached to

  <Text category="book">His first novel, THE KNOWN WORLD, won the
  Pulitzer Prize. This is the book he wrote first, a short story
  collection that I've been looking forward to reading for a long
  time. It was a National Writing Award finalist and a Hemingway
  PEN winner. With a pedigree like that, do I really need to review
  it? Sure, why not? When I reviewed his novel, did I mention that
  he has an amazing ear for dialogue? He does. I believe it shines
  brighter in this setting than in such a sweeping and breathtaking
  saga as his novel. These are stories that you will feel in your
  heart, your mind, your soul, your gut. You'll pause between each
  story so you can ride the wave of awe before you eagerly read the
  next. Jones is an amazing author. He's why we read, and he's why
  some of us try to write. Very few will ever reach this man's

  years. I will be watching for it</Text>
  <Text category="book">This book is a somewhat linear history of
  the past 13,000 years across the continents. Diamond seeks to sum
  up history across various societies on all the continents in a
  relatively short volume. The impetus for this search starts with
  a question from a friend of his from New Guinea named Yali.
  Yali's question was, "Why is it that you white people developed
  so much cargo and brought it to New Guinea, but we black people
  had little cargo of our own?" Reading the book, I think I gulped
  at this point. This sounds like a classic, loaded question. It
  sounds disturbingly close to why have we (Europe and its former
  colonies) succeeded where they have failed. Diamond does not
  descend into that territory though, but he does not evade
  criticism for skirting it completely. There are references to a
  culture's success in industrializing or condensing populations
  that Diamond brushes off as a mixed blessing, for instance. The
  advantages of a hunting/gathering culture are not really explored
  outside of the remarkable sustaining nature of southeast Asia.
  This history can probably be described (or perhaps is most
  successful) as based around environmental causation (as opposed
  to the racial/ethnic/social causation that the lump in my throat
  had been fearing). Descriptions of climate (note: that the
  history begins with the cessation of the last great ice age),
  longitudinal or latitudinal axes, elevation and landmass
  differences play a strong role in determining the fate of
  humanity. Still, it is interesting to look specifically at the
  items gathered in the title. Guns. Europe's refinement of this
  technology was based on China's innovations with gunpowder.
  Today's dominant society is a product as much of what it has
  swallowed and thus incorporated as by what it has innovated. As
  an interesting counterpoint, Japan had owned more and better guns
  in c. 1600 CE, than any country in the world. Samurai rulers
  first limited then outlawed the technology. Japan wouldn't resume
  manufacture until mid 19th century. Obviously, there is an
  indisputable importance in the weaponry's influence in shaping
  the geopolitical world of today. Germs. Epidemics left people
  from cultures based on cities with who could resist smallpox and
  those dense populations more easily replaced those who didn't
  survive. Smaller groups have a distinct disadvantage versus the
  interdependent and consequently more interchangable larger
  cities. Epidemics develop out of these civilizations as germs
  jump over from domesticated animals (and smaller groups may not
  even have animals to domesticate). Interesting note: the emperors
  of the Mayan and Incan civilizations both succumb to disease
  (likely smallpox) rather than guns. Steel. Technological
  advancement is keyed on innovations brought about by dense
  populations and the possibility for abstraction of
  responsibilities. A hunter-gatherer culture lacks the abstraction
  necessary to divide responsibilities to allow for such
  developments as literacy and mining, as the energies that would
  fuel these are directed toward survival areas. Diamond makes an
  interesting and controversial point that the hunter-gatherer
  culture may be more attuned to intelligence as an evolutionary
  necessity over civilized society, where the evolutionary energy
  may be directed at surviving these epidemic illnesses. There are
  many aspects of environment that serve as limiting conditions for
  the development of these things. First, there appears to need to
  be sustainable farming. Many of the staples of modernity are the
  crops first domesticated in the fertile crescent region (where
  today we invade, suck oil, and force the conquered to endure
  freedom). The western Asian breadbasket provided the means to
  bank food so that trades could develop. As a complete side note,
  the Genesis book of the bible can be viewed upon through this
  filter as it goes into great detail how Joseph set up a system of
  storing and meting grain in Egypt to greatly increase the
  population and avoid the calamity of drought and famine brought
  on by sustenance farming. Another factor in the civilizing of
  Eurasia is the landmass itself. Compared to Africa and the
  Americas, Eurasia is mainly west-east axis versus north-south.
  Movement of successes in cultivation and domestication could more
  easily occur because climate differences are easier on a
  latitudinal basis than on longitudinal. Something like corn
  (maize) which was domesticated in central Americas took a very
  long time to make it to North America because of geography.
  Llamas and guinea pigs (which could be useful for pack animals
  and food) never made it north. Conversely, all those fertile
  crescent crops and bigger domesticated animals like cattle,
  horses, pigs were able to spread from one tip of Asia to the
  opposite tip of Europe. To answer Yali's question, some of the
  answer is luck. Africa, Australia and the Americas may not have
  been afforded the botanical or zoological advantages that Eurasia
  had. Some other is environmental determinism, where you are helps
  make up who you become. For going forward, Diamond cites
  transportation, communication and information advances as factors
  that likely will obliviate these historical forces in the future.
  After word: Harpers Magazine tackles an issue that was brought
  up, but not as fully developed here, that of pre-Clovis Native
  American discoveries (pronouncements), knowingly confronting a
  loaded racial/ethnocentric question in a folio called "Might
  White of You: Are American Archaeologists White Supremacists?"
  The archaeological records supports people living in the Americas
  since about 9000-11000 BCE. There are scant scraps of evidence
  prior to that date, but plenty of theories typically more
  titillating than substantive. One wonders if the pre-Clovis
  discovery (especially all the business about "caucusoid" skulls),
  isn't so much about archaeology as setting up an imagined
  genocide to justify a documented genocide.</Text>

  down. I gauge the rating of a book by one thing; Am I able to
  truely come into the story? I am able to do this if the writing

  <Text category="book">As China re-emerges as a dominant power in
  the 21st century, much will hinge on the beliefs of the people in
  that country when it comes to the actions it takes and tolerates
  around the world. Oddly, the fascism of the Communist regime
  remains largely in place in the era following Mao's disastrous
  reign, even as capitalism and other Western ideals spread like
  wildfire through this huge, heavily-populated, and (from a
  Western perspective)oftentimes strange land. Aikman does an
  excellent job of covering the basic bullet points of the history
  of Christianity in China, as well as introducing readers to the
  many Chinese Christians who have led or continue to lead the
  church in their country. On a recent trip to China, I was highly
  impressed by the deep generosity, humility, resourcefulness,
  strength, perseverance, and kindness exhibited by Chinese of all
  ages. This spirit hums just below the surface in the stories
  Aikman tells of the Christian Chinese and their faith. This
  spirit is also, I believe, one of the major reasons why the life
  and teachings of Jesus seem to so easily take root in the hearts
  of so many Chinese. Also, those who are concerned that a
  "Christian China" would somehow gut the land of its culture and
  heritage while propping up a Westernized facsimile in its place
  should rest easy. It seems that the faith is spreading through
  this nation in a very distinctly Chinese way</Text>

  <Text category="book">This book, unlike Morris's work on Hillary,
  is actually worth reading, because its perspective and analysis
  of our 42nd president is fascinating. Though the title is a
  little tiresome (and becomes especially so when Morris continues
  to say throughout the book `Why? Because he could!') the book is
  a fast page turner. I particularly enjoyed Morris's portrayal of
  Clinton as one who only came to life around other people: if they
  were happy, he was, if they were in distress, he felt their pain.
  A master of reading people and changing according to their
  feelings, Clinton was perfectly suited to becoming a president
  who ruled by polls. Enter Dick Morris. As Clinton's chief poller,
  he also became, at one time, his chief political advisor. And
  Clinton needed one. As `My Life' by Clinton shows, the president
  had no overall strategy and failed to see events as
  interconnected. For him, each issue needed to be examined
  individually and with Clinton, that was a laborious endeavor: the
  prez had the painful habit of considering each argument with
  equal weight, and therefore was extremely indecisive and cautious
  to take action. Result? Fiasco's like Waco, Somalia, Bosnia and
  Health Care reform. More seriously for the future: the loss of
  the Congress to the Republicans (over ten years now and counting)
  and the failure to stop Bin Laden. Morris gives credit where
  credit is due though: Clinton's work on welfare reform cut the
  roll books in half and the tough work on deficit reduction
  allowed the economic boom of the 1990s to take place. Also
  interesting, was Clinton's use of the presidency as a bully
  pulpit for families and education: an issue that was local
  politics, and therefore cost Clinton nothing in the budget but
  brought in massive political capital. Read this book before
  reading Clinton's `My Life'. Why? Because Morris points out the
  inconsistencies and just plain untruths contained therein. Also,
  Morris says that the president's autobiography is the `Rosetta
  Stone' that decodes Clinton. If that is the case, then Morris is
  certainly the interpreter.</Text>
  <Text category="book">I have just finished reading
  &amp;amp;quot;The Power of Ethical Management,&amp;amp;quot; and
  I thought it was well written. In the past few weeks I have read
  several other books on business ethics and this one is my
  favorite. It is short and exact with great details on how to
  improve your corporation as well as yourself. This book not only
  can be applied to the work place but in your life at home,
  family, friends, and children. This book has helped me
  greatly</Text>
  <Text category="book">Here's a good litmus test to show how good
  a book like "Breathing Lessons" is--nothing extraordinary happens
  and yet I did not want to put the book down. There are no
  conspiracies to rule the world or cover up some dark secret.
  There are no car chases, explosions, sex scenes (barely even any
  kissing), or exotic locations. No one changes or has an epiphany.
  Almost NOTHING happens--Maggie and Ira go to a funeral and when
  they come back they try to reunite their son and former
  daughter-in-law but nothing changes at all. To the average reader
  this book probably would seem really dull. Heck, if someone told
  me the plot of this book I'd think it was really dull too, but I
  didn't want to put it down. The reason is that Maggie and Ira are
  so well-drawn and so familiar to me that they seem like people I
  know or COULD know. I think I could go to the supermarket and run
  into Maggie and Ira, that's how real they seemed to me. I suppose
  ther reason is that Tyler allows me as the reader to know just
  about everything regarding these two characters and their two
  personalities just come through so transparently in the story
  that they don't seem like CHARACTERS acting their parts; they
  seem like real people. Because of this, even though very little
  happens to Maggie or Ira and even though neither of them changes
  by the end of the book, I cared so much about them that I wanted
  to keep reading right through the end so I breezed through the
  novel in a few days. In all honesty, what I really appreciate
  about this book is that it seemingly disproves almost everything
  I've ever read about how to write a book. This is purely a
  character-driven novel with very little "plot" except for the
  death of Maggie's friend's husband that gets the ball rolling.
  Everything else seems to happen so naturally as an extension of
  Maggie's personality more than any artificially-generated plot
  twists. It's hard for me to find any real faults with this book,
  except for the lengthy flashback near the end that perhaps goes
  on too long. Some people may call this boring or dull, but I
  would call it purely exceptional. I LOVED this book and highly
  recommend it</Text>

  <Text category="book">It seems as if it is impossible for A.S
  Byatt to write a bad or even a mediocre story. After this novel,
  she is one of my new absolute favorites and I have vowed to read
  everything this amazing author has written. I began to read The
  Virgin in the Garden, and could not put it down. I was enraptured
  by the beautiful descriptions of the two contrasting
  "Elizabethian ages" and the characters. Frederica has to be one
  of the most despicable, and yet intriguing literary characters in
  years. My breath was also taken away by the story of Marcus
  Potter--a haunting, amazing character that will stay with you for
  days. The way Byatt writes, she transports you to 1950s England
  and the lives of the Potters. I felt as if I knew these
  characters like family, and could almost sit down to lunch with
  them by the end of the book. Her style, timing, and subtle
  metaphors of passion and life are irresistible and amazing. This
  is truly a writer who will stand the test of time to become an
  icon in the likes of the Brontes, Jane Austen, and Kate Chopin. I
  cannot wait to share this book with everyone I know. Highly,
  highly reccomended. Go to the bookstore or your local library,
  ignore the new glossy bestsellers that try and cheat you out of
  your money and instead pick up this gorgeous, powerful read that
  new authors cannot hold a candle to.</Text>

  haven't read "Caught Stealing" and "Six Bad Things", head to

  <Text category="book">This text was assigned reading in a
  Psych101 back in 1970, but its themes have stayed with me so
  strongly I am now ordering it for my personal library. I was born
  with a club foot, and experienced the power of being different,
  even though my personal defect was so minor as to be rarely
  noticed by others. STIGMA gave me an appreciation of the force
  behind my own shame and the reaction to my difference of others.
  More importantly, I learned about the degrees of identity-- which
  differences make the most difference (sex, race, disabilities...)
  and the increasing intensity that comes with breaking the most
  closely held norms. A classic study</Text>
  <Text category="book">I loved the core knowledge curriculum. The
  reason I switched my children to a charter school is that they
  started out teaching CK. I also switched them back to the public
  school when the principal got away from CK and made it just like
  a public school. I agree that a teacher should supplement what is
  in the CK books to give their students a better understanding of
  the material. Teaching the information exactly how it is
  presented in the books would be very dry. However CK is a great
  outline of what should be taught. It covers a tremendous amount
  of knowledge including the fight for civil rights, all religious
  ideology, multicultural literature and more. If there is a
  problem with the books, it is that many children would not be
  motivated to learn the wide variety of topics covered. For many
  it would be too much. Also weak teachers would be overwhelmed
  trying to cover everything. Hence, anyone claiming that CK
  supports a racist philosophy has never read the books. Also I
  want to point out that the reviewer who called the books racist
  misspelled the word. It is not spelled rasist. I also find it
  disturbing that the reviewer is supposedly a teacher. When
  attending school, maybe that teacher would have benefited from a
  core knowledge foundation.</Text>
  <Text category="book">Polanyi sets forth an incredibly relevant,
  radical, and all too plausible theory in this book. Going beyond
  a mere analysis of how the market system functions, Polanyi
  endeavors to answer the question as to how the market came about.
  Polanyi's answer will not be pleasing to libertarians, he argues
  that a free land and labor market can only come about through
  government intervention, and must be sustained through further
  intervention. He also argues that the market ransforms the nature
  of social relations. Usually, economic relations were a result of
  social relations, under the market, it is the latter. Polanyi
  attempts to show how a market for land and labor came about in
  Britain. His argument that government "enclosures" created it
  through dislodging the poor and turning their land into sources
  of economic production is convincing. However, other arguments
  Polanyi advances simply demonstrate a central government
  repealing the interventions of subaltern governments. Polanyi's
  argument that there was no "rent-seeking" (he doesn't use that
  term) involved in the enactment of state intervion in the economy
  ("proving" that this intervention was objectively necessary is
  suspect. One 19th century investigators conclusions don't serve
  to overturn the implications of public choice theory. The
  greatest problem with this book is that Polanyi doesn't do too
  much to back up his arguments. He fortunately has a section
  called "notes and sources" where he lists his research material,
  but I'd wager that most of this is difficult to find 60 years
  later</Text>
  <Text category="book">I first encountered this gem of a book when
  I decided to home educate my children for a few years, and it
  came with my daughter's fourth grade Calvert School kit. Yes, it
  is European ethnocentric and there are the references to god, but
  our family was and remains enlightened enough and able to explain
  *context* even to children. Whether you are a bible thumper or
  dedicated atheist, or somewhere in between, don't discount this
  book just because of your beliefs! There is much that is amazing
  and simply golden in this book. As a historian, I cannot think of
  a better way to introduce Western Civilization to a child. The
  storybook format is a real winner with kids, and if you're
  reading it to them aloud, as I did, well, play editor as you go
  along! Or take the time to explain the context of the times in
  which it was written. I will be ordering another copy of this
  book, as my original copy was stolen by some rather sneaky and
  acquisitive ex-inlaws (you know who you are!). This book is a

  <Text category="book">Clinton's old friend and key Russia advisor
  provides insight on a number foreign policy topics as they
  evolve. As deputy secretary of state, his accounts provide
  personal, scholarly and practical accounts. The reader might
  determine both that Talbott was an invaluable resource as the
  post-Cold War era evolved, and that in the end, Clinton was his
  own &amp;amp;quot;Russia Hand.&amp;amp;quot; The primary theme of
  the book is the relationship between Clinton and Russian
  President Boris Yeltsin. As they address issues such as NATO
  expansion, the Balkans, economic difficulties, and each
  president's own personal troubles, a number of lessons emerge.
  First, great power politics takes place between human beings, not
  merely among structural or organizational frameworks. Second, the
  blending of idealism and realism is thorough and complex, they
  are not either-or options. Third, political, military, economic,
  domestic and international issues all impact each other, often in
  surprising ways. Fourth, watch out for the u in trying to explain
  policy making: in the generic Y=Ax+By+Cz+u, that u (for
  unexplained/unexpected) can often play a large role. The Russia
  Hand is valuable to students of foreign policy, Russia and
  U.S.-Russia relations, and the emergence of the post-Cold War
  era.</Text>
  <Text category="book">A surprisingly tiny book. (The picture in
  the upper-left corner is nearly actual size.) After receiving it,
  I immediately looked up its dimensions in the description on this
  page. It says 4.7 x 3.3 x 0.6. I had not noticed that before I
  ordered it. The book seems much smaller than that. Not that that
  is a problem; it was just somewhat of a shock to find such a
  minuscule book when I opened the box. I believe it is intended to
  be carried with you in your pocket or glove box or the locket
  around your neck so you'll have a chance to pick out a few choice
  topics of conversation before you enter a party or whatever. It
  certainly is not intended as bathroom reading. For one thing, the
  pages are much too small for emergency TP use. Not that I am
  complaining, mind you. This is a gem of a book with over 200
  interesting bits of trivia listed more or less alphabetically
  from "The Amish" to "Zero". (This is not to imply that the title
  of each page has much to do with the text, but who cares - the
  book is fun.) Each page has its stated "Fact" and a follow-up
  paragraph to expound on the subject. Also, there are a number of
  pages randomly strewn through the book with three "Instant
  Personalities" each - little tidbits of info about famous people.
  (Although, Thomas Jefferson got his own page, as did Alfred
  Hitchcock.) And unlike another trivia book I purchased recently
  (Bla Bla), the information here is actually correct. Will and
  Mangesh research their topics, not just publish un-provable
  "facts" gathered from the Internet. Use the contents with

  these days, it's easy to forget that what's really important is
  the relationship, the energy, between students and teacher. When
  the teacher closes his door and is face-to-face with thirty
  kids--THAT'S where it's at. It's not test scores or textbooks or
  innovative curriculum--it's what happens between PEOPLE in a

  eager, active kids and a caring, active teacher. It's not all
  pleasant, and successes are sometimes small, but a pervasive

  In addition, Johnson talks about natural remedies rather than

  <Text category="book">A mind-opening look into the vicious
  thought patterns depressed people suffer from, this book has been
  more helpful to me than years of therapy *and* a degree in
  psychology. (Although I'm not giving up the meds just yet). I'm
  amazed by how clearly Yapko explains the cognitive distortions we
  have. The case histories he describes are priceless. On the
  &amp;amp;quot;negative&amp;amp;quot; side, Yapko can be just a
  bit condescending at times; it's clear he thinks his way is the
  only way. And although he mentions other theories of depression,
  he favors the &amp;amp;quot;nurture&amp;amp;quot; theory of
  ineffective learned thought patterns, claiming that only a small
  percentage of depression is biochemical in nature. (Maybe next
  lifetime he'll be a woman and get to experience menopause. ;)
  Yapko also has an unfortunate habit of calling depressed people
  &amp;amp;quot;depressives,&amp;amp;quot; which is the kind of
  labeling we could do without. The most serious criticism I have
  is that his &amp;amp;quot;Learn by Doing&amp;amp;quot; exercises
  are sometimes impractical, if not downright silly. For example,
  to learn about perceived control, Yapko writes,
  &amp;amp;quot;spend a few days asking [a partner] for permission
  to do everything, such as 'Can I go to the
  bathroom?'&amp;amp;quot;. (Can you imagine how much your spouse
  would enjoy that after the third day?) Other exercises tell you
  to &amp;amp;quot;interview at least a dozen people&amp;amp;quot;
  or &amp;amp;quot;sometime when you feel playful, experiment with
  trying to motivate people to do impossible things&amp;amp;quot;
  like flying. What depressed person feels playful? Many of these
  exercises would be highly embarrassing, and certainly not within
  the realm of a depressed person's capabilities--especially those
  of us who are &amp;amp;quot;older&amp;amp;quot; and have physical
  disabilities. However, I do plan to complete the written
  exercises. Having outlined these minor drawbacks, I have to say
  it's an excellent book--after all these years, I finally have
  hope about rising from the ashes of depression.</Text>

  <Text category="book">This unforgettable story illustrates the
  crazy, life-changing adventure of a seventeen-year-old boy who
  struggles to let go of his fading childhood and accept the
  phoniness of the adult world. Holden Caulfield's loneliness and
  lack of motivation combined with a traumatic childhood cause him
  to leave behind his youthful days at Pencey Prep to venture into
  the dynamic adult world of New York City. Holden tries to hide
  his youthful innocence as he mirrors the habits of other adults,
  going to bars, drinking, and purchasing prostitutes. However, his
  bickering and sarcastic attitude suggest a hidden desire to stay
  young, a desire he stubbornly buries beneath his new, mature
  lifestyle. Holden, like many others, longs to live in a place
  that is simple and motionless, a place where one needn't worry
  about the past or the future. Holden also hopes to preserve the
  innocence in others, such as his sister, so they don't turn out
  like him, depressed and regretful. Through Salinger's vibrant
  attitude towards Holden's experience in New York, we readers
  learn to stop running from our past to prevent losing our youth
  altogether. The Catcher in the Rye has survived generations as
  one of the world's best bildungsromans, not because it
  illustrates the fading youth and growing maturity of a memorable
  character, but because it demonstrates the confusion of a
  character as he fights desperately to protect what remains of his
  childhood</Text>

  Maura to a mental institution to confront the woman who gave the

  <Text category="book">The novels in this series are not the
  escapist fantasies that many associate with the Arthurian
  legends. They are, in fact, historical fiction at its best. Whyte
  has gone to great lengths to not only ensure historical accuracy,
  but to weave the stories into historic events. The first six
  novels in the series (that is all I have read, though it appears
  that there are two or three more) give a wonderfully plausible
  explaination for the genesis of the Arthurian legend. But the
  beauty of the books is in Whyte's prose. A Scottish poet, he uses
  the language beautifully and creates characters so vivid and
  multidimensional that we forget the 1600 between their time and
  ours. These books will not insult your intelligence, and they
  prove that one does not need to suspend the laws of physics or
  distort the facts of history to find magic in the Arthurian
  legend.</Text>

  <Text category="book">This is a cleverly constructed book of
  several parts and a few recurring motifs. Jones, a Welsh
  Methodist, Everton FC supporter, London hack and Oxford (Arts?)
  graduate, goes to live in Parma, Italy where his beloved has
  established herself. He divides his book into nine separate
  chapters and tries to weave them together as well as his
  excellent English and his motifs will allow. The first chapter
  discusses nuances of the Italian language and he uses those
  nuances to propound that Italy is a much more nuanced country
  than England and that its culture is infinitely more refined. An
  entire chapter brings the nuances of Italian culture to bear on
  football and he waxes very lyrical about the local youth and
  whatever immigrants are around playing ball as the sun goes down.
  The football allows us to place Italian village life in our minds
  and to empathize very much with it. The last chapter is an entire
  ode to Italy. It is written largely in the second person and it
  tells of "you" going through the village and everything there
  appealing to the aesthetic in "you". The English is beautiful and
  it achieves its purpose in making you close the book with a warm
  glow. Mission accomplished. The chapter on Italy's Catholic
  religion and its Protestant and other minorities could have done
  with much improvement. Italy's Catholicism is more complicated
  than the Padre Pio cult and the Protestants of the north surely
  have their faults as well. The chapter looks like it came from
  several previous publications he wrote. The politics chapters
  build on the hypothesis that the fascist and proto communist
  factions are still at war with each other and that politicians
  like Berlusconi exploit this for their own nefarious ends. He
  does a good job of tying the warring World War Two factions in
  with the protagonists and antagonists of later squabbles. He does
  not like Berlusconi and his polished prose does not quite hide
  this fact. My opinion of this book is that Jones sat down with
  his material and tied it all together into a very passable but
  rather superficial book which is nevertheless well worth the
  money being charged.</Text>

  Yes, I worked. But not until they were in school, almost always
  part time and I did not use 'working' as an excuse to not
  volunteer at school, sports, and generally be in my kids lives.
  The point is really about your priorities. Do you instinctively
  put your kids needs first? It's been interesting to see how
  things have worked out with families in our area. We have a large
  group of kids who have been together since kindergarten; now they
  are seniors. You can instantly tell which parents were connected,
  involved and had their priorities straight. Not all of them
  stayed home the whole time. On and off I used to listen to Dr.
  Laura, frequently agreeing, but many times not. What I love is
  that she has an unpopular point of view and she's not going to
  let social, financial, or industry pressure dilute her message.
  Yes, she's frequently abrasive; so were many people who have made

  Captain Jim is so sweet and perfect, you can nearly see him. Miss
  Cornelia is funny and Susan is great. Anne has to deal with
  tragedy and joy that makes the books so wonderful. The only thing
  I don't like, is that i wish Marrilla and all the Avonlea people
  would be in it a little more. In my opinion, this should be where
  the series ends</Text>
  <Text category="book">This book provides a fine introduction to
  the myths of Northern Europe. The book examines the few remnants
  we have in the forms of epic poems and prose, written by
  Christian writers after the fact - the Eddas, Beowulf, and the
  Viking sagas. From these sources, especially the Edda, the author
  reconstructs the myths and stories relating to the Norse gods and
  their subsequent twilight in Ragnarok. Then, the author seeks to
  answer various questions about this myth and determine whatever
  relation it may have had to the original religion of the Northern
  European peoples. The figures of Odin, Thor, Loki, Balder, and
  the rest of the Norse gods play an important part in our European
  cultural heritage and it is nice to see them presented in an
  introduction as here. Whatever underlying mental constructs are
  behind such accounts as that of Ragnarok (the Twilight of the
  Gods) they certainly appear to be universal to the human race, as
  revealed in all forms of apocalyptic literature. Ultimately these
  beliefs died a rather easy death at the hands of the Christian
  worldview. Whatever your personal opinion about the replacement
  of the pagan beliefs by Christianity and whether or not the pagan
  beliefs should be resurrected or remain buried, you will
  certainly profit from reading this book and it will help you to
  better understand Northern Europe in pre-Christian times.
  Finally, it must be noted that in many ways, at least in my
  opinion, the society of the Vikings was superior to our own. I
  admire the strong sense of individualism that the Vikings
  expressed and enjoy greatly reading about their heroic
  feats</Text>
  <Text category="book">This was a fabulous resource for
  understanding the evolution of the Marian cult. The one weakness
  of this book is that it did not deal with the pre-Christian
  origins of the Marian cult. Other resources, however, cover the
  evolution of the Anatolian fertility cult of Cybele into the
  Roman Magna Mater and later into the so-called
  &amp;amp;quot;BVM&amp;amp;quot;. The author does a good job of
  showing the origins of various aspects of Mariology and
  contrasting these developments with Christianity in the West. The
  author has done a great service to those who wish to more fully
  understand the syncretic process which blended Christianity with
  various pagan religions and medeival political structures to
  create the Roman Catholic Church</Text>
  <Text category="book">While previous guides for the serial drama
  "Lost" have often left something to be desired, the book "Finding
  Lost: The Unofficial Guide" more than makes up for it. Nikki
  Stafford's attention to detail (and believe me, *all* "Lost" fans
  should have a great attention to detail) is thus far unparalleled
  in any other guide book. You name it, this guide book has it. In
  addition to the usual episode synopsis, Stafford provides readers
  with all the information they can handle, including keeping track
  of the appearances of the "numbers", discussing theories,
  pointing out bloopers and continuity errors, illuminating
  connections, and just generally proving that she has watched way
  more "Lost" than any of us. In addition to all that, Stafford
  gives the low-down on each of the "Lost" cast members, before
  they became Losties. Even if you have watched each episode of
  "Lost" 4 or 5 times, and think you have caught every little
  nuance and clue hidden within it, I guarentee you'll read this
  book and discover things you didn't catch, or never thought of.
  One of my favorite features in this book is the essay that
  details and explains everything on the "invisible" map that Locke
  briefly gets a glimpse of in season 2 during the episode "Lock
  Down" when the blast door comes down on top of his legs, and a
  black light switches on, illuminating the secret map. Bottom
  line, this book is a must have for serious "Lost" fans. It would
  also be a great aid to anybody who is just now beginning to get
  into "Lost".</Text>

  <Text category="book">Timothy Hart lost his B-25 over Germany in
  1942 and is spending the rest of the war as a guest of the Third
  Reich in Stalag Luft 13. In 1944 Tuskeegee airman Lincoln Scott
  arrives in camp and is promptly accused of cutting the throat of
  smuggler Vincent Bedford. The prisoners demand a trial, their
  jailers agree, and ex-Harvard law student Hart is appointed to
  defend Scott, who appears inexplicably less than grateful. In
  fact their German jailers are more helpful to the defense than
  either Scott or the American officers, or so it seems, as Scott's
  trial for murder progresses against a backdrop of class conflict,
  racial hatred and world war. Atmospheric to the point of
  claustrophobia, a perfectly paced plot, and one of the few times
  I've been completely blindsided by a novel's climax. PS--The film
  adaptation starring Bruce Willis is truly gagworthy, stay away
  from it</Text>
  <Text category="book">As a librarian and a lover of all things
  relating to Arts &amp;amp; Crafts style, I recommend this book to
  anyone desiring a greater knowledge of this furniture's history
  and design evolution. With clear color photographs and just the
  right amount of text, this book illustrates the origins of Arts
  &amp;amp; Crafts furniture in England and its progression, first
  to our East Coast, and eventually Westward across America. In
  fact, my only 'complaint' about this book is that the photographs
  are good enough that they leave you wanting for more. Because of

  consider it one of the most compelling and important books I have
  ever read. Besides being completely absorbed by this man's life
  and experiences, I learned so much valuable information about
  Cambodia from it that I wish it was required reading for anyone
  traveling there. Blended seamlessly with the narrative you will
  learn of the history and culture of the Cambodians, the
  groundwork for the rise of the Khmer Rouge, the horrors and
  fallacies of life under a Communist regime, and the story of Pol
  Pot. I also gained an insight into Buddhist thought and daily
  life in Cambodia, all of which prepared me well for my trip
  there. Haing Ngor's life story also helped me understand the
  damaging psychological consequences endured by the victims of
  this Holocaust, and of the difficulties Cambodians have had in
  trying to adjust to life in America. There are a lot of lessons
  to be learned from this book, and many which can give us a better
  ability to analyze current international events. If you read no

  <Text category="book">This work will be regarded as a classic. It
  is the best work to date on the First Crusade</Text>
  <Text category="book">With relations between the West and the
  Islamic world worsening rapidly, a better understanding of Islam
  and its roots is badly needed in the West. One major barrier
  between understanding Islamic culture is the key sacred text, the
  Q'uran, has been little studied in the West, and until recently,
  good translations were unavailable. Many Qurans were translated
  into the same sort of english as the King James Bible, and not a
  glint of the Quran's revevered poetic beauty was reflected in
  such translations. Thankfully, better translations in modern
  English are being made by leading Islamic scholars who have a
  more sensitive ear to the poetry of the Quran, as well as a
  better understanding of the influence and appeal this text has
  for believing Muslims. Like all great works of literature,
  especially a poetic one like the Quran, its power and beauty can
  only be appreciated in its original language. This is why Muslims
  often say the Quran is untranslateable, but when one hears a
  verse of the Quran being sung aloud with a little knowledge of
  Arabic, the beauty (while unfortunately not fully understandable)
  does start to become apparent. But, even in translation, when
  read carefully the Quran still has great beauty from a literary
  viewpoint. The most beautiful part of the Quran in my view is the
  'Light' surah, which compares God to a light whose glory fills
  the entire cosmos. This surah has been a favourite with Sufis,
  Islamic theologians like Al-Ghazzali, and also Muslim
  philosophers as well. While the Quran does contain descriptions
  of violence and its style is often difficult to read for the
  Westerner, it is important to study this work with patience and
  try and see it as an organic whole rather than a fragmented
  jumble of poems. It is in this sense the deep underlying unity of
  the Quran and its theology (which reflects the unity of Allah,
  the divinity in Islam) becomes apparent, especially in the names
  of God. A good knowledge of this religious classic is becoming
  indispensible in a world where Islam is becoming more important
  to understand from a global perspective</Text>

  <Text category="book">Having read this book as well as Barnet
  Schacter's on New York during the Revolution, both works I find
  are flawed in different ways. The likeable thing about Gallagher
  is that he manages to convey the story in less than half the
  time. The hard thing to realize about the battle of Brooklyn is
  that it really wasn't much of a battle. The author here makes
  some grandoise statements about a new age of citizen warfare
  being ushered in with the advent of this battle. If that is so
  then the complete defeat of Washy's army bodes ill for that
  development! Gallagher is on better ground when he provides a
  nice overall of tactics and warfare in the 18th century. He gives
  a good account of training and recruitment in both armies. One of
  the more interesting things he mentions is that due to the
  two-rank line used by both sides in the Revolutionary War,
  casualties from musketry and artillery tended to be light. This
  is an interesting point, and one not brought out by many
  historians of the period. In europe stronger lines of 3 and
  sometimes 4 ranks were employed, which provided greater strength,
  but also more density. Hence increased loss from fire. A point
  well worth considering when looking at the battles of the
  Revolution. Most historians miss this completely, or are not
  interested in it. Gallagher provides more of a military history
  in general on this subject, but he does waste a lot of time with
  preleminaries. More than half of the book is spent providing the
  standard background for the causes of the Revolution, etc. While
  certainly required for the general reader; when a book is as
  short as this one is it seems almost pointless. When we get down
  to the battle itself Gallagher gives us not much more than
  Schacter does. The British flank march completely compromises
  Washy's position, the outlying forces are swept away clear and
  simple. The confusion of command between Putnam and Sullivan no
  doubt made a bad situation worse. Washy's complete lack of
  strategic perspective shows up totally here. The defense of
  Brooklyn, much less Manhatten itself was a foregoon conclusion.
  Washy was mad to consider defending Brooklyn, much less manhatten
  in the first place. He committed his ill-trained army to an
  impossible task. That he did not lose completely was due more to
  how the British under Howe chose to wage their campaign. Most
  American authors try to put a bright light on what is essnetially
  a dark canvas. At Brooklyn the Americans ran. Period. A few units
  stood their ground, in particular the Marylanders, but no one
  else really did. The reason why American losses were not greater
  was because they did run. Some authors try to say that British
  losses in killed and wounded were greater than Americans at this
  battle. This is true partly because the British had to attack
  some strong positions that held for a time until pireced by the
  assault. British losses were often greater in this regard because
  Americans usually ran once the British bayonet began to strike
  home. Still, of the 1,000+ casualities sustained by the Americans
  here, more than most US historians care to admit fell to British
  musketry and bayonets. The British loss was still well below 400.
  As the great Maurice de Saxe said in his memoirs of warfare in
  this period, more of the enemy can usually be despatched when he
  runs as opposed to when he stands. To reserve fire until the
  enemy line breaks was considered the most effective tactic of
  this period. In that respect many dozens of rebels must have been
  shot down as they ran before British bayonets. Gallagher provides
  some understanding why the British did not storm the heights
  right away. This has often been one of the major criticisms of
  Howe's victory. Why didn't he follow up? After marching all night
  to outflank the Americans, the British were disorganized, and
  tired. They had also foght a running battle with a fleeing enemy.
  Howe did not believe his army was in any condition to storm
  Brooklyn heights, memory of Bunker Hill or no. Of course this
  does not explain why it was not done the following day. If we
  look more closely at Howe's position we can perhaps explain his
  rationale. His commission was both a general and peacemaker. He
  wanted to convince the rebels to come back into the royal fold.
  He could best do this by showing how futile their resistence to
  the crown was. To have destroyed Washy's army in Brooklyn would
  have been gratuitous, excessive. Such loss of blood would have
  defeated the purpose in mind. In restrospect it is easy to find
  fault with this strategy, and it would prove to be the only
  chance the British really had to crush the Revolution in its
  infancy. The battle of Brooklyn needs to be looked at from
  several perspectives. Gallagher gives us a good start, but I
  think a more comprehensive work still needs to address all the
  issues here.</Text>

  <Text category="book">This is a nice compact hardback edition of
  Dashiell Hammett's five novels, which he wrote between 1929 and
  1934. A veteran of Pinkerton detective agency in several cities,
  Hammett turned his intimate familiarity with crooks, low-lives,
  and the seedier side of life into hard-boiled, hard-hitting
  detective stories. This was a time when urban corruption was the
  rule, and private detectives, journalists, and police officers
  shared information. Two of these novels, &amp;amp;quot;The
  Maltese Falcon&amp;amp;quot; and &amp;amp;quot;The Glass
  Key&amp;amp;quot; are American classics. Another,
  &amp;amp;quot;The Thin Man&amp;amp;quot;, inspired one of
  Hollywood's best-loved movie franchises. Hammett's novels lift
  the veil of propriety from the subcultures in which they take
  place, laying bare violence, corruption, and pervasive cynicism.
  But they're not dreary. The sharp prose crackles, and the heroes
  stand apart from the corruption while swimming in it, steadfast
  in their own codes of conduct, their iconoclastic ideologies
  rooted securely in realism. These five novels all appeared as
  serials in magazines prior to being published as novels.
  &amp;amp;quot;The Thin Man&amp;amp;quot; appeared first in
  &amp;amp;quot;Redbook&amp;amp;quot;, the others in
  &amp;amp;quot;Black Mask&amp;amp;quot;. &amp;amp;quot;The Maltese
  Falcon&amp;amp;quot; (1930) and &amp;amp;quot;The Glass
  Key&amp;amp;quot; (1931) are flawless. &amp;amp;quot;The Maltese
  Falcon&amp;amp;quot; features private detective Sam Spade, a
  irresistible femme fatale, and the ruthless pursuit of an ancient
  gold statuette. The last pages of the book are some of the most
  hard-hitting and cynical in all of noir fiction. And they're
  brilliant. &amp;amp;quot;The Glass Key&amp;amp;quot; explores
  political corruption that leads to personal tragedy in an unnamed
  American city. Oddly, the detective is the right-hand man of a
  crime boss. &amp;amp;quot;Red Harvest&amp;amp;quot; (1929)
  features the adventures of Hammett's most popular detective, the
  Continental Op, in a town called Personville, or Poisonville to
  those who know it better. The always unnamed detective for the
  Continental Detective Agency finds himself responsible for
  cleaning up a mining town that is ruled by violence and mob
  warfare. The novel's opening paragraph deserves to be read
  several times. &amp;amp;quot;The Thin Man&amp;amp;quot; (1934) is
  an attempt at humor among New York's blue-blooded, cold-blooded
  upper crust. Hard-boiled humor is interesting in concept. But I
  find the characters in this novel more pitiful than funny, and
  Hammett's style was in decline at this point. At least his
  characteristic cynicism wasn't. &amp;amp;quot;The Dain
  Curse&amp;amp;quot; (1929) is another Continental Op novel. This
  one is melodramatic, absurd, and not up to Hammett's usual
  standards. Hammett fans shouldn't miss it, but others may find it
  pointless. I described the novels in order of descending quality.
  &amp;amp;quot;Complete Novels&amp;amp;quot; organizes them
  chronologically. Five novels is a lot to pack into one book. But
  &amp;amp;quot;Complete Novels&amp;amp;quot; doesn't resemble a
  door stop. It's a handy size actually. The print is not too
  small, but the pages are quite thin. Editor Stanley Marcus, a
  literary critic and frequent admirer of Hammett's work, has
  included a Chronology of Hammett's life and several pages of
  notes on the novels in the back of the book. The chronology is
  informative and provides all of the apparently significant events
  in Hammett's life. The notes are mostly definitions of
  colloquialisms used in the novels, which are useful. The notes
  also contain an introduction to &amp;amp;quot;The Maltese
  Falcon&amp;amp;quot;, written by Hammett in 1934, in which he
  explains the origins of that novel's characters. It's quite
  interesting. For those who prefer to own these novels separately,
  Vintage Crime/Black Lizard hs published some handsome trade
  paperback editions. But if you want hardback and don't mind all
  five novels in one volume, this is quite a nice book</Text>

  <Text category="book">As a former history major and teacher I am
  very familiar with the history of the Crusades from the Western
  point of view. They have been portrayed in literature, movies,
  and history. They have been glamorized and vilified by Westerners
  for centuries. Reading Amin Maalouf's rendering of this familiar
  story from the view-point of Arab chroniclers was like looking
  through Alice's looking glass at a world that is backwards from
  the one we know. Here we don't have just Crusaders, advernturers,
  or even the evil conquerors that deconstructionists portray, but
  invaders, barbarians, and enemies of God Himself. This book is a
  must read for everyone who is concerned about events in the
  Middle East today. It sheds light on a crucial time in history
  that affects the psyche of Muslims who are living right now.
  Especially helpful is the epilogue in which Maalouf explains how
  the collective memory of the Crusades colors the way many
  Middle-easterners see the West. It is not riveting, but very
  readable considering it is a translation. I enjoyed it and

  <Text category="book">An amazing resource to the odd world of
  Chick collecting. Mr. Fowler has crafted an exhausting, almost
  overwhelming guide to all of Chick's works and articles about

  reader is nearly overwhelmed with information. Minute details of
  publishing histories and changes to individual tracts are
  documented down to the smallest letter. The book (presented in a
  distinctive computer printout style, possibly due to its origins
  as a self-published work) is packed with charts of pricing info
  and catalog numbers. But even casual Chick fans will enjoy the
  &amp;amp;quot;History of the World&amp;amp;quot; segment, which
  ties all of Jack's wild theories into a cohesive narrative, and a
  segment devoted entirely to fun trivia (there's a list of every
  instance of the term &amp;amp;quot;haw&amp;amp;quot; for
  instance). Each tract and comic is described, and info is given
  on various parodies and rip-offs. This is a must for all Chick

  <Text category="book">Although everything is shown in silhouette,
  there is plenty of color and action and my kids (boy and girl;

  steaming machines, flowers, critters and more. As the first
  spotlight reviewer did a good job of summarizing the assortment
  of critters and things that one can find I won't say more. But in
  regards to the use of silhouettes instead of pictures or detailed
  line drawings at least one reviewer has said that they didn't
  like them. But I think they miss the point. The book is about
  *shapes* and how much you *can* identify without the `advantage'
  of a detailed picture. And looking at the silhouette and
  identifying the item/creature is part and parcel of the mental
  exercise, just like the rhythm and rhyme of the story. If you
  used pictures you'd hardly learn anything about `shapes' would
  you. No, the use of shadows is just right for exercising young
  minds. For reaching for that Aristotelian abstract (LOL) of what
  is `skunk'. And it is amazing how even the littlest of people can
  tell a skunk from a cat even with Seuss' odd artwork. Five Stars.

  <Text category="book">Seventeen-year-old Catherine Morland has
  always been preoccupied with three very important things:
  dancing, dressing, and reading sensational novels. But doing
  these things won't get you a husband, or acquaint you with other
  young ladies, such as yourself. So, upon request from a neighbor,
  Catherine is invited to spend some time in Bath - a fashionable
  town, where Catherine will have the opportunity to interact with
  people of her own age and stature, who are not related to her.
  And that is where the naive Catherine meets up with the Thorpe
  family. Quickly becoming friends with Isabella Thorpe, Catherine
  begins spending much of her time with the illustrious, yet
  conniving family. And it is only when Catherine is rescued by
  Henry Tilney, along with his charming sister, Eleanor, and
  whisked off to their ancestral home, known only as Northanger
  Abbey. There, Catherine's choice of reading material - mysteries
  and ghost stories, that is - comes back to haunt her; for
  Northanger Abbey is victim to terrible noises in the night - such
  as creaking, and frightening winds, that leave Catherine feeling
  as if she is residing in a haunted place herself. The fact that
  the enormous house is filled with various locked doors, and a
  curious history only heightens young Catherine's suspicions, and
  makes her question what mystery and secrets are lurking within
  Northanger Abbey, and the Tilney family, in general. Jane Austen
  has been a favorite of mine since I was very young, but it was
  not until this past weekend that I happened upon NORTHANGER ABBEY
  while browsing through the bookstore, and decided to purchase it.
  I will admit that, hands down, this has become one of my favorite
  Austen books. Catherine is an enchanting character, whose
  innocence, and naivete make her charming from beginning to end;
  while her overactive imagination leaves the reader chuckling in
  delight at the many crazy notions she creates within that bright
  head of hers. Catherine's interactions with Isabella Thorpe, and
  the rest of the Thorpe family are intrepid, and truly make you
  feel strong emotion towards those particular characters; while
  the charming Henry Tilney - like Mr. Darcy - makes you root for a
  romance to blossom between our dashing businessman, and our young
  heroine. A wonderful, satirical piece of fiction, that should
  certainly be discovered by anyone who calls themselves an Austen
  fan. Erika Sorocco Book Review Columnist for The Community Bugle

  <Text category="book">I wrote this review because I felt that
  none of the reviews so far really got the main cause of this
  book. This is NOT a book about cosmology (as people would expect
  from Roger Penrose). In this tiny book, Penrose summarizes his
  idea that the mind cannot be understood by mathematical processes
  (something much different from the opinion of 99,99% of
  neurobiologists, such as Steven Pinker). This view is near to the
  Nobel laureate Murray Gell-Mann. The book is easy to understand
  and the ideas are very concise and its recommended for the ones
  that are interested in intelligence theories (thus, the author
  assumes that the reader know what a neuron is and how it works!).
  Some may think this is a difficult to understand book because
  they didn't had in mind that this book is about Penrose's point
  of view on intelligence. In fact, I'm not a physicist, nor a
  biologist, simply a high school student and I found the book very
  easy to understand, although I do not agree with Penrose's point
  of view. I think he forgot something very important. Read it and
  read the other point of view and you'll find what it is! :</Text>

  <Text category="book">Not many writers can characterize children
  realistically. Somehow a stylized silhouette emerges and the
  child fades in the background and the plot or adult characters
  take over the storyline and the children characters end up being
  nothing more than fluff. This is definately not one of those
  novels. Carson mcCullers writes almost with artistic persicion on
  her two most elaborate characters, F. Jasmine and John Henry
  West. I really cannot think of another story, maybe, A Good Man
  is Hard to Find, by Flannery O'Conner, where the writer can get
  inside the mind of a child; evoking their unique thoughts and
  feelings with a sense of ease. John Henry West is one of the most
  well rounded and well written children I have ever read, and that
  is a great homage to her writing ability. *I first read this at

  <Text category="book">This book has a lot of insights about
  various ways in which the ' pace of life and learning' have since
  the Scientific Revolution accelerated. In other words it is a
  book which gives one much to think about. The problem is that it
  also suggests that given the vast increase of information
  available to us, the vast increase in 'possible alternatives' for
  our attention, that we will probably have our minds moved away
  from the insights so rapidly as to not even absorb them. The
  obvious reply to such an intense barrage upon our consciousness,
  is to withdraw. And when we withdraw and close out all that is
  accelerating around us, we begin to try and make a pace and story
  of our own within ourselves. The faster we are forced to go, the
  slower we may need to go. I think a companion volume , or perhaps
  a contradictory volume should be written on all those human
  activities which might be aided by our ' going slower in them'.
  And along with this volume should be advice and recommendation of
  how to keep out of our life these seemingly endless intrusions
  which disrupt our living by our own rhythm. "Run slowly, slowly

  <Text category="book">After talking to several pharmaceutical
  reps I know, I decided to shoot for a sales rep job myself. This
  book gives some very good insight into what it takes to land a
  job in the industry, what kind of people you'll be dealing with,
  what the hiring pricess is like (with particular emphasis on the
  interviews), and then what the job is like for people who manage
  to get hired. I'm very glad that I took the time to read this
  book because, after finishing it, I realize that being a
  pharmaceutical sales rep sounds like one of the most horrible
  careers imaginable. Obviously this is simply my own opinion, and
  I know there are plenty of people out there who enjoy this kind
  of work, but nearly every single thing about it, from the
  superficial way applicants are screened, to the shameless
  pandering that sales reps must do on the job, sounds simply awful
  to me. If you are considering a career as a drug rep, you should
  definitely do your homework to make sure it's really something
  you would enjoy. This book may very well convince you that you
  would love it. If so, that's great, and I hope you are
  successful. But if this kind of work is not right for you, this
  book can be equally helpful because you'll find out by reading it
  what the job is really like. There are a lot of books on this
  subject on the market right now, and although this one was
  helpful, I have to say that I think Insider's Guide to the World
  of Pharmaceutical Sales by Jane Williams is far more
  comprehensive and detailed than this one. If you only buy one
  book, definitely buy that one instead. But if you buy two books,
  Pharmaceutical Landing is a good second choice. One more thing:
  There's some sweet irony about this book that I just have to
  report. The author goes to great lengths describing how he
  scrutinizes every single thing about job applicants, from their
  shoes to their body language. He also stresses well-written
  resumes and cover letters. One obvious piece of advice is that
  job applicants spell check everything before submitting it.
  Imagine my surprise, then, when on the very next page it says
  candidates should "...right a short paragraph..." about their job
  experiences. It seems to me that someone who is going to be as
  critical as this author is about job candidates ought to take the
  time to spell check his own book</Text>

  <Text category="book">Janet Browne's far-reaching biography
  misses little in bringing us the life of the 19th Century's most
  controversial biologist/geologist. The first volume of a
  two-volume set, "Voyaging", begins (as you would expect) with his
  youth in the English town of Shrewsbury under his father's care.
  We meet his father - a Doctor and businessman, his brother -
  intelligent but unfocused, and his late grandfather Erasmus
  Darwin who was well known at the time for his eccentric and
  agnostic views. From his early days, Browne depicts a Darwin
  struggling to find himself, first as a medical student in
  Edinburgh, then as a student of theology in Cambridge. Though we
  know better what Darwin is to be, Browne's portrait of him
  manages to evoke the doubt that he must have felt when faced with
  adequate but uninspiring career options. But the story often
  returns to Darwin's love of the outdoors and of biology - a theme
  which underpins all of his early feints and mis-steps at life. He
  is seen as a frequent hunter, and an avid collector and
  cataloguer of insects and beetles. Despite this, and despite the
  benefit of hindsight, at times I felt some tension - finding
  myself unconsciously wishing to offer advice to this young man
  who seems adrift and unaware of the great role that history was
  preparing him for. We finally catch a glimpse of that future as
  he fortuitously receives an offer to travel aboard The Beagle, a
  vessel bound for South America on a surveying mission. I won't
  spoil the rest, other than to say that Browne does an excellent
  job of building Darwin, showing in detail each moment of
  discovery upon which the next is laid, capturing his excitement
  about the natural world as he slowly sheds his amateur standing
  and gains confidence - finally attaining acknowledged scientific
  stature. And yet even then, Darwin holds his boldest work out of
  sight of the world, privately developing the theory of natural
  selection out of sight of a straightjacketed Victorian society.
  In tenor, it's clear that Browne, a Professor in the History of
  Biology greatly respects her subject. But she does not allow him
  to pass through her pen unscathed. Darwin was a man of his times
  and of a certain station, and held certain prejudices that the
  author doesn't hesitate to point out - such as his not wholly
  humanitarian attitudes about slavery. She also reveals what some
  may find Darwin's less endearing traits such as his anti-social
  tendencies and his lack of any real passion for any subject but
  science (When approaching the subject of marriage, Darwin's
  priority on research causes him to discard several eligible but
  too learned women who, he feared, might place demands on his
  time). She does seem to soft-pedal Darwin's poor treatment of his
  companions on The Beagle, many of whom contributed significantly
  to his efforts on that seminal voyage, and whose contributions
  went largely uncredited and unrecognized. (For those curious,
  this theme is well-explored in Robert Wright's "The Moral
  Animal") Also, it was difficult for me to follow the various
  people who pass through his life and their relationship to him,
  more my failing than the author's I think, as she provides ample
  details on the many individuals who made an impact on Darwin's
  life. If you do decide to read it, it might be helpful to keep a
  pen and paper handy for jotting down a few notes (although the
  author does append a fairly extensive family tree at the front of
  the book). Certainly, the book is well worth reading for anyone
  with more than a passing interest in exactly how the theory of
  evolution (and the legend of Charles Darwin) was born. I've read
  few biographies better</Text>

  <Text category="book">Having just spent the last few months
  reading all five books in the Three Musketeer series, the
  following are my suggestions. 1. Read all five books in order.
  The Man in the Iron Mask is probably enjoyable on its own but
  reading the four books that proceed it help place the story in
  its proper context. Think of the Man in the Iron Mask as the
  dessert in a five course meal. Dessert is great but the four
  proceeding course are also enjoyable. Getting to the end of the
  book was especially enjoyable knowing that I was finishing a
  3,500 page experience. 2. Read the Oxford University editions.
  There are wonderful end notes that help the reader keep track of
  the characters and events. When you read 3,500 pages you need
  that type of assistance to keep things straight. The
  Introductions are also very well written and help the reader get
  back into focus before beginning the next chapter. 3. If you
  really like any one book in particular, go to the internet and
  purchase a well illustrated used hardback edition for your
  collection. I purchased a used Three Musketeers with
  illustrations by Maurice Leloir. The three hundred plus
  illustrations make that edition especially enjoyable. Along with
  Sir Walter Scott, Alexandre Dumas created the genre of the
  historical adventure novel. I have been reading these types of
  novels my entire life. Beyond a doubt, Alexandre Dumas is the

  <Text category="book">The sun shines, planets orbit, corporations
  lie voraciously, humans consume mindlessly and Noam Chomsky - the
  pre-eminent intellectual of the modern era - churns out
  knowledge, elucidates the times and refutes the notion that it is
  our manifest destiny to perpetually suffer indignity. In a
  wide-ranging series of question and answer sessions Chomsky
  tackles a myriad of seemingly disparate topics, which ultimately
  pertain to and concern the economic and political system and the
  welfare of humanity. Unlike books authored by Chomsky himself
  which tackle specific topics Understanding Power - The
  Indispensable Chomsky is the transcript of sessions traversing a
  decade during which Chomsky takes questions from the audience on
  a number of topics ranging from US foreign policy, imperialism,
  trade and the third world to propaganda, corporate media,
  solutions to the collective malaise and the march towards a more
  just system and society. Expounding on his legendary
  encyclopaedic knowledge and command of logic, Professor Chomsky
  manages to offer the questioners, and by extension the readers, a
  radical approach distinct from the boilerplate and mind-numbing
  discussions of the corporate media. Refuting the suitability of
  handling our problems by working within the system and nibbling
  at the edges Chomsky offers an alternative to the broken system
  without resorting to the expected customary answers like a broken
  record. As thoughtful and brilliant as the discourse is, the
  book's editors also deserve much praise not only for the
  compilation, but also for the easy to read format and the lively
  pace of the book. Understanding Power could easily have been
  entitled Understanding The System and is a brilliant book based

  at one point that film had surpassed literature as the

  his life to that arena. His interview "On Screenwriting"
  describes both the benefits and the frustrations associated with

  <Text category="book">Some long ago inventer discovered that if
  you place carefully shapped rocks just so they will remain in
  place as an arch, dramatically reducing the amount of stone you
  need to hold up a bridge, an aquaduct, or the entrance to a

  that a bunch of arches next to each other would yield an arched
  ceiling to a room. My guess is that it then took a very long time
  for someone to recognize that if you made a series of arches in a
  circle you could make a domed room. But as soon as one was built,
  I suspect that a priest of some kind looked up and immediately
  saw that a minature version of the sky had been created, and that
  an artist could transform this sky into a 'Vision of Heaven.'

  <Text category="book">Alliterative Analogies, assertively
  assembled, appear aplenty, appropriately, apt and artful,
  absorbing attention ad infinitum. This could be a fitting summary
  of Abish's stunningly &amp;amp;quot;now&amp;amp;quot; novel,
  written almost a quarter of a century ago with a linguistic
  device concocted between Kabbala and alliteration. Chapter 1 is
  composed with words beginning only with the letter A, Chapter 2
  with A and B and so on until chapter 27, when Z first, then
  chapter by chapter all other letters, are progressively
  subtracted. In spite of a scheme tracing back to the beginning of
  written literature, the novel tells of deeds and characters so
  surprisingly contemporary, they may have been culled from today's
  headlines: polysexually inclined thugs hide in Africa after a
  crime spree, with the Author in pursuit of the woman who betrayed
  them. Chasing after the thugs from country to country, we are
  introduced to a ruler queen transvestite, war and genocide,
  corrupted burocrats and soldiers, rampant corruption in a
  landscape still in hot air, where sparsely assembled people
  wollow in African Indolence. All is narrated with poetic
  detachment, in a dimension between joke and dream that implies
  social, political and historical commentary with what appears
  linguistical accidentality: it is just that the words were
  limited by my artifice, reader, the Author seems to smile. No
  harm intended. Perhaps: the scenario may have seemed so far
  fetched in 1974, to have been deemed the product of unabridged
  fantasy. Great art, when unhindered, relates to the whole of
  time, in all tenses. While amusing, Abish has managed a ponderous
  read, which meandering on through verisimilar everyday history of
  attitudes and practices, inserts deep philosophical reflections
  as light as the puns enclosing them and extends like a prophecy
  to contemporary events. Attentive readers will delight in finding
  the one slip from the add-subtract letter scheme. And wonder: was
  it accidental? &amp;amp;quot;In order to be perfect, all I lack

  <Text category="book">Although I'm not new to WWII histories, the
  First World War is one of my favorite historical periods to read
  about and one of my favorite books from that war is Alistar
  Horne's "The Price of Glory." Since I enjoyed reading about one
  if WWI's most epic battles, I did not hesitate to read
  "Stalingrad: The Fateful Siege" by Antony Beevor. In both works,
  comparisons are made between the battles of Verdun and Stalingrad
  and for good reasons. Both battles were initiated by German
  forces that underestimated the tenacity of their enemy, the
  course of battle spun wildly beyond their commander's control,
  and both battles cost a near unimaginable loss of life and human
  suffering. Beevor is especially keen on the amount of human agony
  throughout the battle of Stalingrad, which makes the book
  gutwrenching but at the same time the reader is unable to put it
  down. From the well-documented cold, lice, and hunger that
  haunted Russian and German soldier alike, to the disease and
  desperation experienced by the Sixth Army as they were slowly
  strangled in Zhukov's trap, it seems that Beevor has overlooked
  nothing. Unlike many battle histories that may focus on stategy
  or political fallout of the conflict, the emphasis on human
  suffering and heroism in Beevor's work makes the reader
  sympathize for Russians, Germans, Romanians, and anyone else
  unlucky enough to get caught in the battle. Not only does Beevor
  shed light on the plight of ordinary soldiers, he also examines
  the more famous players in the battle; including a paranoid
  Stalin, a dreaming Hitler, a finger-pointing von Manstein, and a
  indecisive Paulus. Indeed, the reader gains perspective from
  Rastenburg and Moscow all the way down the heirarchy to the
  frozen bunkers of Stalingrad. Overall, "Stalingrad: The Fateful
  Siege" is an excellent book that is recommended for anyone
  interested in World War II or just any hard-hitting military

  Linux beginners. But it fails in small, maddening ways when
  speaking to this audience. After a lot of discussion of disk
  partitioning and install, page 65 tells you to run the "man"
  command in a shell session. It offers no clue that the only way
  to terminate a "man" command is the letter Q - a completely
  unintuitive action. So a new user can flounder forever, or at
  least until they get frustrated and reboot. But I don't mean to
  slam just this book. That same problem exists in most other
  beginning Linux books, even O'Reilly's pocket guide. All these
  knowledgeable authors seem to think that noephytes will somehow
  magically gain access to information that the authors have in
  their heads, but haven't committed to paper. Except for that,
  it's a very good book.</Text>

  <Text category="book">This book has a wealth of information for
  any practitioner of yoga, from beginner to advanced. The content
  is concise and practical, and the poses are sequenced in a way
  that allows for a gradual and safe progression in the practice.
  There are also dozens of practice sequences given for both
  improvement and how to treat common ailments through yoga. The
  introduction is especially valuable, as it offers a no fluff
  in-depth commentary on the philosophical thought behind the asana
  practice. I pick it up again and again and am still referring to
  it after nearly 15 years of owing it. My copy is dog eared and
  loved, and was well worth every penny. An earlier reviewer
  mentioned that the photos and layout were not user friendly, and
  only gave the book two stars, which is a shame. This book was
  first printed in the mid 1960's - over 40 years ago! It was the
  first yoga book of it's kind to ever be printed, and it's content
  is timeless and as relevant today as ever. Mr. Iyengar even had
  to struggle with his then publisher to be allowed to include so
  many photos, as it was so expensive in those days to print such a
  book. I say hats off to the man who brought yoga to the west long
  before it was ready. He's a pioneer and a virtuoso of his craft,
  and his marvelous work should never be over overlooked just
  because it doesn't come in some glossy package fit for the
  masses</Text>
  <Text category="book">I haven't completed the book yet, but so

  <Text category="book">This was perhaps the best of Johannes
  Steinhoff's books, since it does not deal with his own stellar
  yet tragic WW II and post war career. The insights of the average
  person living in Germany are of great importance to both social
  and military historians alike. Steinhoff offered this collective
  testament as a warning to all of us regarding war and the rise of
  a dictator. As Johannes said in an interview, &amp;amp;quot;It is
  always the civilians who suffer the most, yet are remembered the

  <Text category="book">I have not been able to put this book down
  since I received it. I have always dreamed of visiting Italy, but
  until that time comes, I have been redecorating my home to
  reflect that dream. I now have a &amp;amp;quot;Tuscan
  kitchen&amp;amp;quot; that makes me very happy to be in. I bought
  this book for new ideas,and also to confirm that the elements in
  my home already are the correct ones. I was thrilled to find
  these &amp;amp;quot;Tuscan elements&amp;amp;quot; such as
  pottery, stones, tiles discussed throughout. And the photographs
  inspire me to pay attention to details. It's all about the
  textures of the walls, the colors, how you display your
  ceramics....the pictures are beautiful. I may not get to Italy
  any time soon, but this book helped bring my dream a little
  closer to home</Text>
  <Text category="book">This was actually the first Kellerman novel
  I read and I found it kind of dull at first, but that's only
  because I didn't know any of the situations or people among whom
  I was thrust. After reading a couple earlier books, I have
  re-read this one and I now find it interesting. So, I would
  really have to recommend that one tries to read the series more
  or less in order. This one starts out with Alex Delaware seeing a
  new girlfriend named Allison. Robin has married another man after
  some ten (?) years with Alex. [I haven't read the one where she
  actually leaves yet (unless this is the first mention of it), but
  if she broke his heart ... !] See, I had no idea who Robin was
  first time I read this - makes a difference. The cuuuuute little
  dog named Spike makes an appearance too. First time I read it, he
  was just an irritating little squirt, but now I know just how
  adorable he can really be and it was nice seeing him again.
  Alex's police pal Milo is a lieutenant now and can pick and
  choose his cases. He and Alex are together when they come across
  a grisly crime scene. A young couple has been brutally murdered
  and the woman can not even be identified. Milo draws Alex into
  the investigation and it gets complicated. Everything seems to
  lead back to the dead boy's psychologist and when she turns up
  murdered too, things really start cooking with gas! I adore
  Detective Milo Sturgis. I know Alex is the star, but I can't help
  it. Milo is such a great character</Text>
  <Text category="book">This commentary has many tremendous
  insights into the book of Romans. Romans is one of the richest
  resources of truth within the Bible and John Stoot does a good
  job of unpacking it. The book is written from a framework of the
  reader having a strong prior understanding of the Scriptures. It
  is probably not considered a highly scholarly work, but it is not
  for the average reader to pick up for light reading either</Text>

  <Text category="book">Billy Collins's original voice is
  delightfully accessible, often blending comedy and solemnity in
  one poem, and always with something new to say. The playful tone
  of these poems can be misleading; whether he is writing about
  eating a good plate of Osso Bucco or his favorite museum rooms,
  there is always a pathos lingering in the silence after the last
  line. Most relieving is the absence of pretentiousness or haughty
  language. This is simply, as Robert Bly writes in his
  introduction to the best American poems of 1999, Collins's
  skillful ability to &amp;amp;quot;bring the soul up close to the
  thing&amp;amp;quot; in every poem. Books such as
  &amp;amp;quot;The Art of Drowning&amp;amp;quot; threaten to
  change the face and purpose of poetry in the 21st century. Let's
  hope there is plenty more to come from Billy Collins</Text>

  <Text category="book">A wonderful wonderful book.Although the
  book was written some 150 year ago, Mary Eliza Rogers takes you
  into the intimacies of daily life in Palestine in the 1850's as
  if it was occurring today. She writes from her heart with
  honesty,integrity and a clear mind. And although written at a
  time of Victorian prejudicies and colonialism she writes without
  bias or judgement. From her beautiful and colourful descriptions
  one can envisage the Holy Land as it was before undergoing the
  process of modernisation and change. For anyone who has any
  attachment to this land it is a truly wonderful and personal
  experience to read this book</Text>
  <Text category="book">The working notes of this book are utterly
  staggering in their implication to ontology. What is being?
  Merleau answers in the manner of Lao-Tse, and alludes to
  something like a divine-feminine at the heart of wild perception.
  It was said by Sartre in his autobiography
  &amp;amp;quot;Situations&amp;amp;quot; that after Merleau's
  mother died who was like a &amp;amp;quot;goddess&amp;amp;quot; to
  him Merleau returned began the project anew. What is intimated in
  the working notes is invaluable to the true student of philosophy
  and life. And in the end, Merleau returns to the very object of
  his study. You can really feel this descent at the book nears its
  end. It is, however, an ascent of the entirety of the history of
  philosophy to a new level of comprehension. That I assure
  you</Text>
  <Text category="book">A quality photography book that visually
  recounts pertinent steps in the history of noir photography and
  more specifically, the creation of the term noir as it pertains
  to film and photography in the 20th c. in New York City. A breath
  of realism, history and fact that beautifully illustrates a fine
  curatorial example of the kinds of images published by the Daily
  News that made this paper a forerunner in the telling of real
  stories suffered and celebrated by real people. William Hannigan
  is to be commended for his fine selection of photographic and
  negative samples of a time not long past and still very alive in
  the movies and crime documents that inspire and fascinate us
  today. A necessary addition to any photo library of value</Text>
  <Text category="book">I'm a big Koontz fan and as is generally
  the case, I greatly enjoyed this story. It was a little strange
  but that's to be expected from this author and genre. That said,
  it starts off fairly quickly and flows well through most of the
  book. It had the curious sense of near-division in that the book
  almost seemed to be separated into two distinct sections that
  were not, in my opionion, as well-connected as in many of
  Koontz's other books. In addition, the ending seemed a little
  hasty. Thus I gave it four rather than five stars. That said, I
  would gladly recommend it to a friend as I would most any of this
  author's work</Text>
  <Text category="book">If you love Ludlum's over-the-top novels
  (and I do), The Matarese Circle has to be up there with the best.
  Not all of Ludlum's books are a good match of plot and style --
  the repeated &amp;amp;quot;Oh my God!&amp;amp;quot; declamations
  of one character after another can get silly when the goings-on
  aren't as riveting as they could be (the two Bourne sequels
  suffer from this problem, I think.) But Circle delivers on all
  fronts. Part One is a masterpiece all by itself -- the intricate
  cat-and-mouse game between Talienkov and Scofield plays out
  thrillingly. And these are two of Ludlum's most believably drawn
  characters; we feel empathy for both, and root for them to join
  forces from the get-go. Antonia Gravet, the inevitable gorgeous
  heroine/love interest who surfaces in Part Two, brings a
  well-crafted and believable backstory to the plot. One final
  bonus: some of Ludlum's zestiest minor characters appear in this
  book, adding to the fun in nearly every chapter.</Text>
  <Text category="book">This is the author's presentation of the
  Satipatthana Sutra, the basic sutra on mindfullness. As in all of
  his works he does the work of a good Dharma teacher very well. He
  keeps his own personality and teaching idiosyncrasies out of the
  way so that the student's understanding can arise naturally.
  There are more elaborate and academic descriptions of the Sutra
  available and more detailed descriptions of how to use the Sutra
  in meditation. But this is good basic information presented in a
  good manner with no frills or personal quirks. The author gives a
  good commentary on the Sutra and explains why he translates
  certain passages, but he also gives the alternate
  interpretations. This is a fine basic introduction to the central
  issue in Vapassana meditation. Highly recommended</Text>
  <Text category="book">This is a great book to have in your

  everything, drama, action, humor, and a few love stories to boot.
  There are few books that have made me laugh or cry like this book
  did. By the time your are done you will have new friends Woodrow,
  Pea Eye, Claire, Lorena, but especially Gus McCrea. and you will
  also have some new villains particularly the frightening Blue
  Duck. I can't recommend a book any more than this one</Text>
  <Text category="book">explodes upon the crime-detective scene.
  THE HUNDRETH MAN, his first book was excellent and THE DEATH
  COLLECTORS is as good and even better. Can't wait for the next
  one! Why this is an Amazon sale item befuddles me. But since it
  is , grab this bargain while you can because it is a terrific
  novel! The PSIT team of LAPD, Carson Ryder and Harry Nautilus are
  faced with a dual-time mystery. More than 30 years in the past, a
  serial killer with a following of mesmerized women who adore him,
  is killed in the courtroom the day he is sentenced. And NOW;
  starting with the grizzly find of a murdered prostitute in a
  seedy motel room...it seems as though the serial killer has risen
  from the dead to continue his reign of terror. Each time a new
  murder surfaces the killer is a step ahead and just out of reach
  of Carson and Harry. The touch of subtle humor adds bas-relief
  without taking anything away from the thread of the story and
  lightens it tension for brief seconds at a time.Perfect! The
  murders are freakish! Disgusting! Brutal! But the two PSIT
  detectives refuse to give up and what finally unravels the
  twisted cloth of this old/new mystery will knock you out of your
  chair. A truly masterfully plotted novel with two familiar and
  charismatic 'partners against crime'. A series to follow and
  enjoy. Get both of Kerley's books and double your pleasure! Try
  them, you'll like them and you'll love Jack Kerley. I
  promise!!</Text>

  <Text category="book">Shadowbred by Paul Kemp is simply an
  excellent book. The story is incredibly engrossing, the
  atmosphere set for each scene is really top-notch, and the
  journey Paul takes his character's through is really incredible.
  We see personal demons and struggles of the heroes. Struggles
  with faith, the journey of an anti-hero to a hero and whether he
  can really make this journey. The villains are equally deep and
  interesting and frankly human. If you are a fan of fantasy
  literature, definitely pick this one up - you won't regret it. As
  a side note, you might want to pick up the previous books by Paul
  featuring Erevis Cale as well</Text>
  <Text category="book">This is a GREAT book. Well written and

  <Text category="book">I really enjoyed this book. I could pore
  over the fashions, the interior decoration - it satisfied my
  desire to see all the details! At the same time, I got a sense of
  the passage of time in Virginia and Vanessa's lives. Read as a
  companion to any of Woolf's novels, I think the book would also
  convey a sense of the writing process. It evokes the time and
  place beautifully, and the text is not intrusive: the images are
  allowed to take centre stage as works of art in their own right.

  <Text category="book">I think the most striking part of this book
  is that you feel comforted by the fact that the problems you're
  facing in your own relationships are commonplace. They're not
  dysfunctional. Every family has its share of issues and you don't
  need to feel overly guilty for yours. The book's underlying theme
  is that families that honesty, consideration, character, belief
  and perhaps above everything else - resilience, can get you
  through the worst debacles and that at the end of the day it's
  probably (though not always) worth the effort. Stories include:
  Resentment about controlling parents who appear to display
  conditional loving and also about appreciating how much of their
  lives parents sacrifice to bring the kids up; the search for
  redemption after abandoning a kid or cheating on a wife, the
  courage required to break relationships that are dead and the
  perseverance required to bring one back from the dead (and the
  effect on kids), dealing with the families of your in-laws and
  family objection to marriage, how to deal with kids who are
  falling into bad habits when you feel powerless to influence
  their decisions because they no longer respect you or listen to
  you, dealing with the death of a child, how we feel obligated to
  spend time with our families rather than actually wanting to
  spend time with them and what we are losing, etc. Although it may
  seem that most people cannot relate to these situations...
  actually I felt an amazing amount of empathy for the families and
  came away with a renewed conviction that I can get the perfect
  family life (with all it's frustrations and headaches) and
  balance it with everything. If you have any relationship,
  friendship that you have a certain amount of frustration,
  resignation about then I strongly recommend this book. It is one
  of those books that if it hits you at the right time - it could
  change your relationships and your life</Text>

  <Text category="book">I'm not a huge fan of this genre of music,
  but as a very part-time musician, this book was recommended by a
  fellow friend and musician. I liked this book alot and found it
  education and entertaining, even if the subject matter was not of
  immense interest. This is definitely not the fault of the author,
  who did a fine job of making this subject engaging. Thus, I found
  the read illuminating to no small degree. I learned alot about
  the roots of punk, how it spread and rose, and the end of it. By
  correctly defining the terms of the book "The Indie Years", we
  only see what happens to the bands in their formative years. Once
  they sign with a major label, their story is ended. This was both
  a good idea and frustrating one, as we see the birth and growth
  of bands, but not what happens to them (in most cases) once they
  hit a major label. Frequently, signing with a major label
  creates/expands both the zeniths and nadirs for a band and I
  would have liked to have known what happened from there.
  Regardless, this book is well-written and a great read for any
  person who likes the bands included in the book.</Text>

  <Text category="book">The Miernik Dossier was shockingly good.
  Before this, I had never read anything by McCarry. In fact, I had
  never even heard the man's name. I was lucky to come across a
  review of this re-issued work in a magazine. Now I am collecting
  everything by him. The story follows an odd assortment of people,
  some of whom may or may not be intelligence agents, as they
  travel south through Europe into Africa. For the entire length of
  the book you will be wondering and guessing and probably changing
  your mind many times as to who is working against whom and trying
  to figure out if Miernik is who he says he is. The writers of the
  dossier themselves seem to be unsure. In that sense the Miernik
  Dossier has similar elements to a mystery or detective novel, but
  yet it goes way beyond that. It is also a highly compelling
  character study, with each of the group drawn intricately by the
  author so that you come to know the characters. This makes it all
  the more suspenseful because these people who you seem to know or
  possibly identify with in some way may very well not be who you
  think they are. The Miernik Dossier is a highly entertaining
  read. True spy literature, in the vein of Ashenden, that is
  enjoyable for those who enjoy spy stories, mysteries or simply
  great writing. I cannot wait to read this book again</Text>

  <Text category="book">Dr. Amen has changed my life and the lives
  of several members of my family. The stigma associated with
  mental illness is deep-seated and difficult to overcome.
  Understanding the root causes, particularly the genetic
  predisposition within families, is the indispensable first step
  in coming to grips with dealing with life-long problems. These
  problems are often not adequately addressed via behavior
  modification or cognitive therapies because they get the cart
  before the horse: they do not deal with the biological root
  causes. Once those are dealt with, the learned behaviors and
  habitual patterns can be peeled away to create a whole new start
  on life. However, without the understanding of the causes and
  types of underlying brain conditions, one is often doomed to the
  roll the rock up the same hill only to see it roll down again as
  we watch. Take my advice. If the brain pattern descriptions look
  all too familiar, get help as recommended. You will become a new
  person, the one you were created to be. And that is a wonderful
  thing</Text>
  <Text category="book">We have used this book as a text for
  discrete math courses in our undergraduate Computing Engineering
  and Systems program (University of los Andes, Colombia). There
  are a lot of advantages using this approach instead of the
  classical one (e.g., people really learn to prove and learn to
  write correct proofs). However, to grasp these ideas you have to
  be patient and open minded. When other reviewers give 1 star to
  the book it is clear for me that perhaps they were expecting
  something magical that did not occur. This presentation of logic
  and its applications to informatics provides an excellent way to
  learn and really use the knowledge in the praxis. In Chapter 8
  you go seamlessly from propositional to higher order logic. Sums
  and logical quantifications are, for example, treated in an
  uniform way. Maybe the type concept is not so fine explained, but
  one has to remember that this is an introductory book. 5 stars,

  <Text category="book">This is the best book. I was writing a book
  about my son who has SI Dysfunction. He is 23 years old now. I
  was in Barnes and Noble looking for another book when I found
  this. I was blown away. I never knew there was a book like this.
  I could have really used this book when Marcus was little. It is
  so wonderful. I opened it and started reading about my son. My
  book is called What's Wrong With My Child? Struggling With
  Sensory Integration Dysfunction. It is only a mother's story of
  how my child coped with this thing. It is not meant to be a book
  like Carol Stock Kranowitz's. Her book is wonderful. Anyone who
  has any questions about their child who has SI Dysfunction. This

  <Text category="book">I love this book! It is a terrific blend of
  hand-holding and concrete advice for writers. Each chapter takes
  the writer/reader through the tough questions we face when we sit
  down to write: How do we begin? Where do ideas come from? Is
  there a ritual we can create that will help us begin? I like the
  fact that I could use this book as a resource. In other words, I
  did not have to read it cover to cover. Rather, it truly serves
  as a guide, a mentor's guide, that can serve me as I continue to
  write. I really liked the movie section, where Cathleen Rountree
  uses movies to make points about the writing process. I found
  those sections inspirational and useful. If you want to be a
  writer or if you are already writing, I urge you to Buy this

  <Text category="book">As other reviewers have stated, Ludlum
  passed away at the time of the publication of this novel.
  Unfortunately, we may never know what other voice has been
  mingled with Ludlum's to complete this tale. Honestly speaking, I
  believe this to be the case because the story is actually better
  than I have come to expect from Ludlum. No disrespect intended,
  but I feel this work is actually above his standard. There is
  certainly a few moments of unbelievable plotting and
  characterization, but who cares when the ride is such a rip. At
  first you think you're reading a typical espionage thriller and
  eventually come to realize it's more than that, much more. For
  New World Order conspiracy fans you're in for a treat. Ludlum et
  al's take on an old plot is so fresh and intrigueing you are left

  <Text category="book">This fantastic re-imagining of the Avengers
  is best consumed in this form. Yes there are too many pop culture
  references, yes the hulk is a little goofy and the Ultimate Nick
  Fury has virtually nothing in common with his regular universe
  counterpart but I think once your done with this gigantic,
  thirteen issue epic powerhouse you wont have much left to
  complain about. This story arc takes the Alternate Universe
  Avengers from their creation to their first major victory, ill
  let someone else spoil it for you but its good. The second volume
  is juuuust about complete as of november 2006 and is pretty
  amazing as well. This is the best that the Ultimate universe has
  to offer, is one of the few titles exploring fairly original
  ideas and has not been reworked specifically to appeal to
  teenagers, no inline skates, teen angst, or first love in this
  one. Millar and Hitch are a great creative team but their ability
  to make deadlines is positively absurd. These thirteen issues
  took the better part of three years to be released and I read
  every one of those issues as it was released on the news stand.
  My wife got her MSW in the time it took the skrull war to unfold,
  it sucked and the new series isnt much better. Thankfully it has
  only one issue to go, hopefully well get it before theres a new
  president in the whitehouse. Removed from the delays the series
  is a pretty impressive achievement, the art is top notch and the
  story is positively crackin! Yes it's "just" a super hero comic

  <Text category="book">According to Charles Kimball, religion is
  the most powerful and pervasive force on earth. Religion inspires
  humans to transcend their self-interests, while at the same time,
  more evil has been committed in the name of religion than any
  other human institution. Using a comparative religious approach,
  Kimball uncovers five warning signs that increase the likelihood
  of a religion becoming unhealthy or evil. Kimball argues the word
  `religion' is amorphous and difficult to define. As a result, the
  author believes a comparative religious methodology is necessary,
  one that sees the similarities and interconnectedness of all
  religions. Kimball, next, asks if religion is the cause of evil,
  and he answers both yes and no. A religion that is arrogant,
  condescending, and requires adherents to "disconnect their brain"
  is problematic. On the other hand, religion opens up humanity to
  a universe of purpose and beauty and teaches how to live
  meaningful and moral lives as individuals and in community.
  Kimball seeks to discover the signs that increase the likelihood
  of religion becoming evil. The first warning sign that religion
  is displaying tendencies towards evil is the belief and adherence
  to absolute truth claims. When conceptualizations of God are held
  with certainty and rigid doctrine, the propensity towards evil
  increases dramatically. Sacred texts, sources of wisdom and
  guidance, become abused when selective readings of the text are
  used to reinforce these absolute truth claims. Christianity and
  Islam have missionary mandates, but these become imperialistic
  when conversion is forced because of absolute truth claims.
  Kimball argues for a "human view of truth", one that is dynamic
  and relational, allowing adherents to affirm truth without
  solidifying truth claims into absolute propositions. Another
  pivotal point when religion becomes evil is blind obedience: when
  adherents abdicate personal responsibility to religious
  authorities. When a charismatic leader demands total obedience,
  has unrestricted power, and has total control, religion is
  unhealthy. Uncritical acceptance of doctrine is also unhealthy,
  as authentic religion encourages questions and reflection. Strict
  segregation from the larger society, combined with a leader with
  unlimited power is dangerous. Kimball asserts that religious
  inquiry and freedom of thought are necessary for responsible
  religious adherence. Every religious tradition believes that
  something is awry on earth, while some believe that an ideal time
  will arrive in the future. When adherents believe they can speak
  for God and wish to usher in this time, the likelihood for
  disaster increases. Many Muslims embrace the hope for an all
  Islamic society, zealous Jewish settlers dream of a time when
  Israel will be returned to its divinely promised status, and the
  Christian Religious Right believe that America should be
  politically structured with Christian principles in mind. Kimball
  opines those who narrowly define temporal structures of the state
  and those who believe they are God's agents to usher in a
  theocracy are dangerous. Religion also becomes a force for evil
  when the ends justify any means: when one theological component
  gets elevated, thus becoming an end, and adherents become
  consumed with achieving or protecting this end. All religions
  have notions of sacred space, but an unhealthy religion becomes
  obsessed with protecting this space. Reinforcing or protecting
  group identity against an `other', or protecting group identity
  from within the group, are also potentially dangerous signs.
  Institutional structures develop in all religious traditions, but
  corruption occurs when the protection of the institution becomes
  the end. Kimball asserts that a healthy religion preserves the
  connection between means and ends. The last warning sign occurs
  when religious leaders believe their struggle is a "holy" war.
  Kimball outlines the history of pacifism to the just war theory
  and crusader ideals within Christianity, and he shows how each of
  these views were represented in the Gulf War of 1990-91. Islam is
  a peaceful religion, which asks adherents to build a just and
  peaceful social order. The word jihad means "struggling in the
  way of God," but in a narrower sense jihad is understood as a
  struggle in a military sense - with rules similar to the
  Christian just war theory. Because of socio-economic disparities,
  some Muslims openly advocate violent means to achieve
  revolutionary ends, and some leaders declare this revolution as a
  holy war in order to legitimize their cause. Kimball believes
  both that Christian and Muslim adherents should not speak of war
  but of peace and that the call for holy war is not holy. With the
  knowledge of when religion becomes evil, religions have a clear
  understanding of healthy praxis. Faith, hope, and love should be
  the guiding spiritual compass for all religious adherents, so
  that in times of conflict unhealthy religious mechanisms can be
  averted. Against secularism, Kimball finds validity in religious
  traditions because of the time-tested wisdom and ethical
  standards, and he believes that religions should embrace
  religious diversity. With religious diversity Christians have
  three options, exclusivism, inclusivism, and pluralism, but
  Kimball believes each position has value if adherents from
  different faiths work together for the common good of humanity.
  Finally, the Middle East represents a microcosm for the world
  community: if peaceable solutions are not found in the
  Arab-Israeli-Palestinian conflict, then the future for the world
  community and world religions are bleak</Text>

  <Text category="book">Arrogance by Bernard Goldberg is a truly
  enjoyable read. Goldberg doesn't waste time trying to create a
  vast left wing conspiracy tied to Islam or Communism, he just
  presents the facts as he sees them. As a former insider, he's got
  the dirt on media bigwigs, and he's not afraid to dish. The
  liberal bias in the news is causing many people to flee the big
  three networks and turn on cable to find an escape. Goldberg
  offers up several examples of this bias and then goes further by
  coming up with several suggestions (some tongue in cheek) for
  correcting this slant. He also includes surprisingly frank
  interviews with Tim Russert and Bob Costas. Goldberg's other
  books Bias and 100 People Who are Screwing Up America are also
  excellent reads. He doesn't attack people on a personal level
  (although you can tell he has a bit of a grudge against Dan
  Rather) or use hyperbole or vitriol to get his point across. Some
  books written with a conservative slant make you want to throw up
  your hands and give up on this country, but Goldberg's books
  don't have that effect. You can tell he not only loves the
  country he lives in, but also the profession that he's chosen,
  and he has hope for the future.</Text>

  <Text category="book">Why read a book from 1857 which flopped so
  badly as commercial literature that Melville stopped writing and
  ended his career as a customs official? Because this book
  masterfully explores the entire nature of trust, confidence and
  cons. Though the setting is a riverboat on the Mississippi River
  just before the U.S. exploded into Civil War, its insights cross
  cultural boundaries. This is not an easy book to read for several
  reasons. First, it is undoubtedly one of the first "post-modern"
  novels which breaks from traditional narrative storytelling. (
  Another example: Dostoevsky's Notes From the Underground.) The
  Confidence-Man is a collection of 45 conversations between
  various people on the riverboat--beggars, absurdly dressed
  frontiersmen, sickly misers, shysters, patent medicine hucksters,
  veterans (of the Mexican-American War) and the "hero" in the
  latter part of the book, the Cosmopolitan. In typical Melville
  fashion, you also get asides--directly to the reader, in several
  cases, as if Melville felt the need to address issues of fiction
  outside the actual form of his novel. The lack of structure,
  action and conclusion make this a post-modern type book, but if
  you read each conversation as a separate story, then it starts to
  make more sense. For what ties the book together is not a story
  but a theme: the nature of trust and confidence. In a very sly
  way, Melville shows how a variety of cons are worked, as the
  absolutely distrustful are slowly but surely convinced to do
  exactly what they vowed not to do: buy the "herbal" patent
  medicine, buy shares in a bogus stock venture, or donate cash to
  a suspect "charity." In other chapters, it seems like the con
  artist is either stopped in his tracks or is conned himself.
  Since the book is mostly conversations, we are left to our own
  conclusions; there is no authorial voice wrapping up each chapter
  with a neatly stated ending. This elliptical structure conveys
  the ambiguous nature of trust; we don't want to be taken, but
  confidence is also necessary for any business to be transacted.
  To trust no one is to be entirely isolated. Melville also raises
  the question: is it always a bad thing to be conned? The sickly
  man seems to be improved by his purchase of the worthless herbal
  remedy, and the donor conned out of his cash for the bogus
  charity also seems to feel better about himself and life. The
  ornery frontiersman who's been conned by lazy helpers softens up
  enough to trust the smooth-talking employment agency owner. Is
  that a terrible thing, to trust despite a history of being
  burned? The ambuiguous nature of the bonds of trust is also
  explored. We think the Cosmopolitan is a con-man, but when he
  convinces a fellow passenger to part with a heavy sum, he returns
  it, just to prove a point. Is that a continuance of the con, or
  is he actually trustworthy? The book is also an exploration of a
  peculiarly American task: sorting out who to trust in a
  multicultural non-traditional society of highly diverse and
  highly mobile citizens. In a traditional society, things operate
  in rote ways; young people follow in their parents' traditional
  roles, money is made and lent according to unchanging standards,
  and faith/tradition guides transactions such as marriage and
  business along well-worn pathways. But in America, none of this
  structure is available. Even in Melville's day, America was a
  polyglot culture on the move; you had to decide who to trust
  based on their dress, manner and speech/pitch. The con, of
  course, works on precisely this necessity to rely on one's senses
  and rationality rather than a traditional network of trusted
  people and methods. So the con man dresses well and has a good
  story, and an answer for every doubt. The second reason why
  Melville is hard to read is his long, leisurely, clause upon
  clause sentences. But the book is also peppered with his sly
  humor, which sneaks up on you... well, just like a good
  con.</Text>

  <Text category="book">Thirty five years ago my high school
  (Thomas Jefferson, in Federal Way, Washington) held annual
  competitions in mathematics. They did it in the form of a test
  that came bound in a small white booklet, just was a few pages
  long. There weren't many questions, perhaps a dozen or two
  (usually in the form of story problems), but they required deep
  thought and concentration (at least for me). I still remember the
  feeling of excitement and trepidation as I took the "white book"
  and opened it to the first problem. Several hours later I'd
  consider myself accomplished if I'd managed to completely answer
  more than half the questions. Ian Stewart's book reminds me of
  those tests. Here's a sampling of what's inside: 1)Mrs. Anne-Lida
  Worm decides she wants a new couch, and tells Mr. Worm to get it
  for her, while she goes shopping for a new tight for baby
  Wermintrude. But Anne-Lina doesn't want just any couch. She wants
  the biggest possible couch that can be carried down the hall in
  their house, and around the 90-degree hall at the end. What shape
  does the couch have, and how big is it? This is a truly riveting
  story. Will Mr. Worm solve the couch problem in time? 2)Alberto
  wants to conduct tests on grapes, evaluating the influence of
  different soils. He wants to conduct experiments to see how
  different soils and exposure to the sun affects the quality of
  wine. His land is on a hillside, though, which is narrow, so he
  can plant only three varieties of grape on each plot of land. How
  can he arrange things so that he tests all seven varieties of
  grapes when they are arranged so that each plot contains exactly
  three different species, where any two plots have exactly one
  variety in common, and any two varieties lie in exactly one
  common plot? Sixteen chapters make up this book. Though their
  titles are whimsical, the mathematical problems aren't. Some are
  still unsolved. Even though these problems fit in what would
  probably be called recreational mathematics, they are fiendishly
  cleaver with solutions, and developed insight along the way, that
  are at once challenging and rewarding. Here's a sample of some of
  other topics discussed in Stewart's book: How might one transport
  a lion, llama, and head of lettuce in a boat, across a lake,
  without leaving any two species where one might eat the other in
  the absence of a caretaker? How can you calculate the temperature
  and entropy of a curve? How can one even talk sensibly about a
  curve having temperature and entropy in the first place? Suppose
  that you need to tile a room, and the tiles come in odd shapes.
  Is there anyway to know if the tiling problem has a solution? Can
  mathematics tell us things about evolution, such as whether or
  not evolution comes gradually or in spurts (or both)? This is a
  fun, lighthearted book, but the mathematical problems and puzzles
  it discusses will really make you think. I enjoy reading as I
  exercise on my elliptical machine. I get double the sense of
  accomplishment when I can read and workout at the same time.
  Ordinarily, I can estimate how long I've been on the machine by
  how many pages I've read - 20 pages in 40 minutes is about
  average. But with Stewart's book I had to be careful. Several
  times I found that I'd worked out for an hour and only managed to
  cover half-a-dozen pages or so. If you love mathematics,
  particularly mathematical puzzles, then this is a book you'll
  really enjoy. It has many problems for the reader, with answers
  at the back of each chapter. If you do the problems and
  understand everything in the book, in detail, it will occupy many
  hours of your time. All in deep thought and utter
  enjoyment.</Text>
  <Text category="book">Of all of Willard's books, this one was my
  favorite. Willard offers a systematic study of the nature of
  being, and then proposes a pragmatic approach to setting the hear
  back on course to purity and submission to God. A human being, he
  says (p. 30), is composed of thought, feeling, choice, body,
  social context and soul. He states plainly (p. 41), "It is the
  central point of this book that spiritual transformation only
  happens as each essential dimension of the human being is
  transformed to Christlikeness under the direction of a regenerate
  will interacting with the constant overtures of grace from God.
  Such transformation is not the result of mere human effort and
  cannot be accomplished by putting pressure on the will
  (heart/spirit) alone." Fundamental to this project is first dying
  to self, taking up the cross, and living in self-denial (chapter
  4). We must then go through a process like learning a new
  language. The general steps he summarizes in the acronym VIM:
  vision, intention, means (p. 85). These are a vision for kingdom
  life, the will to do it, and the means to carry it out. The rest
  of the book is structured around a look at the transformation of
  the mind (chapters 6-7), will (8), body (9), social context (10),
  and the soul (11). The work of the mind involves being cognizant
  of the ideas and feelings that drive our society and our personal
  lives. Instead we should be renewed with love, joy, and peace in
  the inner life. The work of the will involves surrendering our
  will to God's, and then moving from abandonment to contentment.
  Here the spiritual disciplines bring to light our duplicity on
  these matters. The work of the body means realizing the
  over-emphasis we place on it and the need to cease idolizing and
  misusing our bodies. The work of our social context involves
  noting the use of assault and withdrawal that characterizes our
  relationships (p. 181). Lastly, the work of the soul, which
  Willard defines as the unifying factor of them all, is best
  summarized in Psalm 1. We are to be renewed into new beings who
  happily fulfill the law of God. Again, I said this was my
  favorite of Willard's works. I'm not sure any of the rest of them
  so thoroughly transcend from the theological to the practical
  without missing a step. The systematic study of human nature is
  all-inclusive. He lays out a blueprint of a kingdom vision of
  what the human being (emphasis on being) is. The very nature of
  humanity, from the state in which we find it to the place it is
  supposed to be, is spelled out here. The enormity of the work is
  amazing for such a readable text</Text>

  <Text category="book">Never Be Sick Again offers a major
  breakthrough in medical thinking regarding health and disease. I
  am a biochemist doing medical research at UCLA. A friend gave me
  this book to read, and I was very skeptical. After reading it, I
  couldn't stop thinking about what it was saying. I even lost
  sleep thinking about it. After many weeks, I have come to a
  conclusion - the author is right. There is only one disease and
  there are only two causes of disease - revolutionary! Once you
  understand this simple concept, it changes everything. If your
  mind is not closed to new ideas, the profound insights in this
  book will change your life for the better. It will give you the
  power to both prevent and reverse almost all disease. With this

  <Text category="book">I will start this review by noting two
  things. I greatly appreciated Nussbaum's 'Upheavals of Thought',
  and I am uncomfortable with the way sex sits in the society I
  live in. (But, then, I recognise things in myself that - for good
  or bad - change my perspective from that of the society I am
  embedded in.) But Wedekind's play 'Springtime Awakening' should
  raise alarm bells for most of us. We are sexual beings (most of
  us anyway) and we have to deal with that - learn to accept it
  within ourselves, learn to share it with others (it is, of
  course, the quintessential sharing experience), learn to grow
  with it, learn to let it go .... The easy path to take is to
  grasp a social 'norm' and follow it regardless of the morality of
  that path. Societies do present many 'norms' to a young person
  developing sexual awareness but not all of these are equally
  desirable. If Nussbaum's book does nothing else but diminish the
  acceptability of some of the undesirable 'norms', and enhance the
  more socially responsible ones it will have achieved a great
  service. There are curious things in this book for me. Nussbaum
  refers to many sources but many of them are male - Aristotle,
  Seneca, JS Mill, DH Lawrence .... To be fair, the last chapter is
  about 'To the Lighthouse' by Virginia Woolf, and other writers
  such as Andrea Dworkin are prominent. However I was surprised
  that some powerful women writers are totally ignored - where is
  Mary Wolstonecraft, where is Emma Goldman, where is Mary Shelley?
  Why is 'Maurice' (Forster) referred to but not 'The Well of
  Loneliness' (Hall)? The chapter on female genital mutilation
  (FGM) is an appalling indictment on the behaviour of some
  societies. Nussbaum has a glancing reference to circumcision; not
  surpringly it is glancing for someone who was converted (so I
  read) to Judaism. While I would never compare what happens to
  baby boys with what happens to young women in severity or risk,
  nevertheless I think the motivations for both practices come from
  the same source. If, for cultural (religious) reasons it is
  appropriate for Jewish boys to be circumcised, I think it is a
  very dangerous position to take to expect other societies to
  abandon the practices they see as legitimate, if not mandatory.
  The chapter on Equity and Mercy impressed me immensely - it is so
  balanced I expect many feminists will hate it. But for me, her
  rare use of a Christian quote ('Forgive them, for they know not
  what they do.') was a revelation. Never before had I seen how
  compromised that plea is. (Compare with Tolstoy: 'It is a
  wonderful thing to be loved because of oneself, but it is a far
  more wonderful thing to be loved in spite of oneself.') The fact
  that often I have other feelings than Nussbaum expresses does not
  concern me, because she often has perspectives that broaden or
  hone my own thoughts. In the chapter on prostitution and its
  illegality I had to agree with most of what she writes simply
  from a libertarian point of view rather than one of morality. The
  morality issues are complex - perhaps irresolvably complex. Just
  as there are men with 'dangerous' sexuality, so there are women.
  Perhaps it's only an issue for men because they demand or expect
  control. For me, all of Nussbaum's discussions seem to centre on
  the effects on women that prostitution entails - this is not
  inappopriate even though it may not be balanced. The problem I
  see with prostitution is that it panders to the man's 'need' to
  have sex. They can get it on demand. This reduces their
  sensitivities to the needs of the women in their lives, including
  the need (wise or not) for a woman to have a faithful partner. In
  Australia we had an advisor on women's affairs to the Federal
  Government write a piece in a newspaper where she expressed the
  view - based on her own practice - that a woman should always
  make sure her husband knew where the red light district was in a
  city they were visiting, so he could satisfy his 'need' when she
  herself felt incapable. For me this is an appalling suggestion -
  as if men cannot have self-control and should not be expected to.
  But, for all of that, like Nussbaum I would not see prostitution
  as worthy of being made illegal. For me this was a
  thought-provoking read. It had some incredibly ugly things to
  describe, to consider. But it helped me to structure my thoughts
  in this difficult area - perhaps it will help me guide my boys as
  they reach maturity. Other recommendations: 'Springtime
  Awakening' - Wedekind 'The Well of Loneliness' - Radclyffe Hall
  (I hated the outcome of this) 'Matilda' - Mary Shelley (her
  biographical details are worth exploring too) 'Godwin on
  Wollstonecraft' - William Godwin (Mary Shelley's father; Mary
  Wollstonecraft was her mother) 'Upheavals to Thought' - Nussbaum
  'Living my Life' - Emma Goldman 'Let Me Alone' - Anna Kavan

  summer vacation assignment. In all, I do not enjoy reading books
  , but I was surprised by the humor in this book. When I was
  reading it, I would have to stop reading and I would start
  laughing. It would take a while to calm myself down. It first
  started with John and Lorraine, then a lot of strange things
  started to happen to them. The old man that they where trying to
  prank call, was actually going to give them money. When they meet
  him it all changed. They where worried because they lied to him
  and did not know what to do. They told him the truth and became
  good friends with the Pig Man. They called him the pig man
  because his name was Mr. Pignati, and he collected hundreds of
  little pig statues. John and Lorraine learned a lot about the

  <Text category="book">This is one of the finest popular histories
  I have ever read. Whether it is a book about 5th and 6th century
  British history using Arthur as a organizing principle, or a book
  about the "real" Arthur using 5th and 6th century history as a
  backdrop, this book is wholly convincing concerning the reality
  of Arthur and the historical context in which he lived. The book
  may actually be too good. The most convincing evidence it cites
  -- the so-called British Easter Annals -- appear to have been
  called into question by subsequent scholarship; and the link
  between Arthur and Mount Badon is not quite as convicing as it
  seeme to be when Alcock wrote the book. In short, this
  masterpiece needs updating. But a masterpiece it is. No one who
  reads this book with any care can fail to come away from it
  without a vastly improved understanding not only of the British
  dark ages, but of the nature of historical evidence, scholarship,

  <Text category="book">This story drew me in at once because of
  the strong voice and the good writing. It clearly establishes a
  sense of time and place (modern day Madison, Wisconsin) and
  offers the "promise" of an intimate look at daily life during the
  last stages of ALS (Lou Gehrig's Disease) from the perspective of
  a personal caregiver. While we learn to understand the struggles
  of the patient, Kate, this is more about the struggles of a
  college student known as "Bec," as she travels an emotional path
  of coming into her own. Author, Michelle Wildgen, fulfills the
  promise. This story is character-driven, and what made me turn
  the pages wasn't the story, which was, at times, a bit slow and
  uninspiring. With the exception of the "blue butterfly," the
  additional sex scenes felt extraneous. Further, one can guess
  from the beginning that in terms of Kate's condition, there
  wouldn't be a `happy' ending. Regardless, Wildgen paints a very
  realistic picture of ALS, and definitely puts you in the room.
  What made me turn the pages was Wildgen's ability to make each of
  her characters come alive. I cared about them and wanted to see
  how they'd handle Kate's progressive and ultimate demise. Bec is
  the narrator who learns as she goes (both how to take care of
  Kate and how to cook for her guests/staff/family). We see
  everything through her eyes, particularly as she becomes Kate's
  voice. The title, "You're Not You," comes from Kate, as she asks
  Bec to speak for her in a manner beyond mere translation. The
  secondary characters are also well developed, including Kate's
  husband, Evan, Bec's roommate, Jill, and to a lesser degree,
  Bec's lover, Liam. Liam, a married faculty member, represents
  another dimension of Bec's floundering, and her search to, in a
  sense, pick a major. Ultimately, the story becomes a vehicle for
  Bec's eventual direction of career choice. I recommend as a
  thought provoking read, and for the strong writing and character
  development. Additionally, if you know (or have known) someone
  with ALS, I believe you'll appreciate the author's knowledge and
  sensitivity. From the author of "A Line Between Friends," McKenna

  <Text category="book">I recently re-read ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA
  prior to attending The Colorado Shakespeare Festival's
  performance of the ambitious play under the summer stars here in
  Boulder. Drawn from Sir Thomas North's 1579 English version of
  Plutarch's Lives, William Shakespeare (1552-1616) produced this
  romantic tragedy late in his career, around 1607, and published
  it in the First Folio in 1623. It tells the story of a doomed
  romance between two charismatic lovers, Roman military leader,
  Marc Antony, and the captivating Queen of Egypt (and former
  mistress of Julius Caesar), Cleopatra. When his wife, Fulvia
  unexpectedly dies, Antony is summoned from Egypt to Rome to mend
  a political rift with Octavius by marrying his recently widowed
  sister, Octavia. Of course, this news enrages passionate
  Cleopatra. She vents her anger on the messenger, but is quick to
  realize that Octavia is no real rival to her when it comes to
  beauty. However, Antony soon follows his heart back to
  Cleopatra's arms, abandoning his new wife in Athens. This leads
  to war, when Octavius declares war on Egypt. After Octavius
  eventually defeats Antony at Alexandria, Cleopatra sends a false
  report of her suicide, which prompts Antony to wound himself
  mortally. Antony dies in his lover's arms, and rather than submit
  to Roman rule under the new Caesar (Octavius), the heart-broken
  Cleopatra asks to have a poisonous snake delivered to her in a
  basket of figs. In the end, ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA is as much about
  new sparks re-igniting the flames of love as new political forces
  supplanting old political regimes. It is a play that reminds me
  that it is perhaps better to re-read and understand Shakespeare
  than to devour one bestseller after the next. G. Merritt</Text>

  <Text category="book">Carson McCullers, one of America's greatest
  Southern writers, was often misunderstood, as many people were
  put off by or unwilling to deal with her (at the time)
  controversial subject matter. MCCullers used the grotesque as
  exaggerated symbols of everyday experience. The loneliness and
  isolation of her gothic-like characters were merely extreme
  examples of feelings we all have, though magnified and
  intensified to the nth degree. Tennessee Williams, in his
  introduction to MCCullers' "Reflections in a Golden Eye", posed
  the question (in a mock dialogue) most people asked about writers
  of the 'gothic' school such as Carson McCullers, Flannery
  O'Connor, Katherine Anne Porter and Eudora Welty: "Why do they
  write about such dreadful things?" Williams replies, " In my
  opinion it is most simply definable as a sense, an intuition of
  an underlying dreadfulness in modern society.. Why have they got
  to use..symbols of the grotesque and the violent? Because a book
  is short and a man's life is long... The awfulness has to be
  compressed." McCullers, unlike any writer I have ever read,
  pierces the heart of themes such as love, isolation, and
  loneliness with her lucid, poetic prose. Tennessee Williams, in
  Virginia Spencer Carr's biography of McCullers summed up
  McCullers' writing as follows: "I have used the word 'heart', but
  it is not an adequate word to describe the core of Carson
  McCullers' genius....I believe, in fact I know, that there are
  many, many with heart who lack the need or gift to express it.
  And therefore Carson McCullers is what I would call a necessary
  writer: She owned the heart and the deep understanding of it, but
  in addition she had that 'tongue of angels' that gave her power
  to sing of it, to make of it an anthem.</Text>

  <Text category="book">For the English-language reader Wedgwood's
  book, which has been in print for over sixty years, is still an
  excellent introduction and synoptic narrative of this lengthy and
  turbulent period of European history. It gives brief and
  judicious biographical sketches of the major political and
  military actors of three generations: The principal antagonists
  at the outset -- Ferdinand II of Austria and Frederick V, Elector
  Palatine; the condottieri-style generals - Spinola, von Mansfeld,
  Tilly, Wallenstein, Piccolomini, Christian of Halberstadt,
  Bernhard of Saxe-Weimar, the duc d'Enghien (Conde); the
  contentious minor rulers -- Maximilian V of Bavaria, Johann Georg
  of Saxony; the northern monarchs -- Christian IV of Denmark and
  Gustavus Adophus of Sweden (and his daughter Christina and prime
  minister, Oxenstierna); the "spoiler", Cardinal Richelieu; the
  new Emperor Ferdinand III and his cousin, the warlord
  Cardinal-Infant Ferdinand of Spain; and many others. This book is
  written in a traditional English historian's prose style that is
  clear, eloquent and totally lacking the jargon of concurrent and
  later social and economic histories, while still covering these
  aspects of the period. In spite of some reviewers' claims of a
  "Protestant bias" in her interpretation, the author seems
  extremely fair when assessing responsibility for the long-running
  disaster of the war, taking the position that it was the
  self-serving political interests of the participants (dynasties,
  rulers, generals and paymasters) that kept the war going at the
  expense of the social and economic welfare of the vast majority
  of inhabitants of Germany and Bohemia. Although I am not familiar
  with this new edition (and Grafton's introduction) I emphasize
  that any reissuing of this book should have a brief scholarly
  introduction which supplies more details on the constitutional
  arrangements and crises of the Holy Roman Empire during the
  sixteenth century, with a special emphasis on the composition of
  the Bohemian estates and the conflicts between the estates and
  the Habsburg king-emperors. The extent and internal organization
  of "the Bohemian crown lands" should also be outlined. A succinct
  review of the political status of Lutheranism, Calvinism, the
  Bohemian Brethren, and other Protestant confessions throughout
  all of Europe around the year 1600 and a note on how their status
  had altered by 1700 would also be useful in "setting the stage"
  for the events of 1618 and understanding the
  relgious-denomination consequences of the war. The author
  supplies sufficient details on the major battles, but this is not
  a work of military history. As Wedgwood knows, battles were only
  significant in the larger view as a result of their political
  consequences. And it is in the elucidation of the underlying
  politics of the war (including how political prospects shifted
  with the waxing and waning of military fortunes) that Wedgwood
  excels. In her analysis of the general European situation at the
  outset of the war she proposes that there were three sets of
  forces which underlay and drove contemporary events. Each was a
  source of conflict and each might cross-cut the others,
  complicating the declared interests and objectives of the
  dynasties and nations involved. In brief, the forces were: (a)
  Religion, with three major competing factions (Catholic,
  Lutheran, Calvinist; she notes that the conflict between the
  latter two forms of Protestantism was often as extreme as it was
  between each of them and the Roman Catholic Church). (b)
  Nationalism (French, German, Czech, etc.), which was a new force
  on the scene, crystallizing the idea that political entities
  might be defined by nationality (which here equals some
  combination of ethnicity and native language) rather than
  conceived of as polyglot territorial agglomerations brought about
  by dynastic interests. (c) Monarchic-constitutional issues, which
  were especially complicated and ambiguous within the
  "constitutional" grouping of major and minor powers known as The
  Holy Roman Empire (HRE). The constitutional problem was twofold.
  Within the small arenas of developing nation states and the yet
  smaller ones of traditional rulerships throughout Europe
  (duchies, counties, "free-city" areas ruled by town councils and
  mayors) contests over the basis and extent of the rulers' powers
  and privileges were taking place. Aristocrats, oligarchs and
  merchants had traditional corporate bodies (estates) reluctant to
  cede their own powers (taxation, the organization of military
  service) to a central authority. The same conflict was also being
  played out on the larger scale of the Hly Roman Epire, that loose
  grouping of special obligations and exemptions which was the
  final residue of an earlier system of vassalage binding together
  the elected Emperor (who had been a Habsburg for several
  centuries) and the smaller rulerships of Central Europe. The
  religious reforms, rebellions and wars of the sixteenth century
  had produced a system that appeared to resolve some of the
  potential problems through the won privilege of cujus regio, eius
  religio ("whoever rules, his religion [is the religion of the
  ruled area]"). In the year of the war's inception, 1618, this new
  balance was very fragile, comprising four Catholic and three
  Protestant imperial Electors. In Germany the special arrangements
  regulating relationships between the Emperor (resident in Vienna
  or Prague) and local rulers and guaranteeing a great deal of
  political autonomy to the locals, especially the Protestant
  Electors, had been somewhat codified by the Augsburg Treaty of
  1555, and were known as the "German Liberties". These would prove
  to be especially important to the three Protestant Electors at
  the outset of the war. In the developing continental war one
  could be pro- or anti-Habsburg based on any one of the above
  factors or any combination of two or three of them. For example,
  a Catholic ruler (including the papacy) might seek Protestant
  allies in order to combat Habsburg territorial expansion in his
  direction or to combat constitutional changes in the Empire which
  affected his position adversely. Or a Protestant power might
  accept the Habsburg "program" in any given case because it did
  not wish to disturb constitutional arrangements that were to its
  advantage (this characterization is apt for Saxony and
  Brandenburg during the first twelve years of the war.) As
  Wedgwood notes, all three considerations (religion, nationality,
  constitutional relations) could be and were used cynically to
  advance the positions and interests of individual rulers and
  factions. From the point of view of rationality or
  predictability, political choices and commitments were often
  self-contradictory (e.g., a Catholic power supporting a
  Protestant venture; a German Liberties party accepting occupation
  by the army of a foreign power, etc.) or temporary expedients
  that made the overall European situation more chaotic. The war
  began locally in Bohemia, but its complications and consequences
  radiated outward as far west as Spain and England (even farther,
  to the Caribbean naval theater), as far north as Sweden and
  northeast to Poland, as far south as Italy and southeast as
  Transylvania; in other words, it was a European continental war
  with global impact. When the war broke out in 1618 it was over
  the Habsburg violation of a "constitutional guarantee" of
  religious freedom in Bohemia (the concessions stated in Rudolf
  II's Letter of Majesty). And here is where individual
  personalities and beliefs played an important role. Ferdinand II,
  who had knowingly violated the terms of the Letter soon after
  being selected by the Bohemian Diet as King (and therefore the
  first in precedence of the HRE Electors) was determined not only
  to expand the political powers of the Habsburg dynasty in Bohemia
  and elsewhere, he was firmly committed to the goals of the
  Catholic Counter-Reformation (i.e., re-Catholicizing all of the
  areas within the HRE which had become Protestant during the last
  one hundred years). When he was deposed by a special convention
  of the Bohemian estates (the defenestration of his deputies in
  Prague being the signal event of this deposition), the crown of
  Bohemia was offered to the Elector of the (Rhineland) Palatinate,
  Frederick V, who considered himself a champion of the Protestant
  cause. The religious zeal of these two antagonists led to extreme
  fixed positions at the very outset of the war. Given the other
  major conflict hovering in the background -- the Spanish Habsburg
  determination to recover the now Protestant area of the
  Netherlands which had become the successful and defiant (Dutch)
  United Provinces - the war soon became international. While the
  entry of France and then Denmark followed by Sweden, into the war
  during the 1620's changed its nature and extended its duration,
  Wedgwood concentrates much of her analysis on the behavior of the
  two Protestant Electors, Johann Georg of Saxony and Georg Wilhelm
  of Brandenburg and one Catholic ruler, Maximilian of Bavaria. It
  is her contention throughout the book that Johann Georg and
  Maximilian in particular could have prevented the war's spread
  and forced Ferdinand into a compromise very early in the course
  of events that acquired their own dynamism once they got out of
  hand. Despite their religious differences these two were always
  strong "German Liberties" proponents, and each had the same view
  of the Austrian Habsburg rulers: they should be kept for the
  broader protections they offered, but kept in place with respect
  to encroachments on the traditional rights of local rulers. In
  the end both of these rulers survived the lengthy war in spite of
  numerous diplomatic and military reversals (Saxony switched sides
  and joined the Swedes for several years, while Maximilian's
  position was constantly and secretly supported by his nominal
  enemies, the French, as their potential foot in the Habsburg
  camp.) Wedgwood believes that the price of their survival was far
  too costly for the rest of Germany. Wedgwood's gloss on the
  changing nature of the conflict is that by the year 1635 the war
  had become one of great-power politics, and that the earlier
  religious and ideological causes were losing their ability to
  motivate the antagonists. Her summary of the changes emphasizes
  the following: (a) Religion had discredited itself as a plausible
  source of political programs and a legitimate cause for war.
  Religion was becoming more interiorized and private, and losing
  ground philosophically and ethically to the new prestige of
  empirical and applied science (this was the era of Galileo and
  Kepler, with Descartes, Harvey, Hook, Newton, Huygens, etc. on
  the near horizon; a time of laboratory science and scientific
  societies.) As the basis of a political program religion was
  viewed cynically by those who saw the devastation it had brought
  about. (b) For thinking men, nationalism began to fill the
  emotional void in public life left by the withdrawal of religion
  as the underlying motive for political and cultural action. This
  was very obvious in France, but even true of Ferdinand III, for
  whom the new main cause was the construction of an Austrian-based
  hereditary monarchy whose additional obligations as the Holy
  Roman Imperial protector of far-flung German Catholics were no
  longer perceived as worthwhile. In the minds of both Germans and
  Austrian Habsburgs the Holy Roman Empire was becoming an
  honorific entity with ambiguous and weak political commitments in
  Germany. The Elbe-North German-Pomeranian ideal empire of
  Wallenstein was never again revived as a dynastic program.
  Austria began to move south and east (toward Italy, Croatia, and
  Hungary) in its expansionist aims. (c) The control of immense
  polyglot, multi-religious, mercenary armies and their huge camp
  followings had become a pressing matter of concern for all of the
  political authorities that hired them - they were neither
  religious nor national in their motives and aims and were in fact
  independent "mobile states" unto themselves, cynical and
  rapacious and often as dangerous to their paymasters as to their
  foes; whenever their immediate prospects for pay and maintenance
  looked bad, they changed sides. The most successful mercenary
  generals had become mini-sovereigns. Officers were all "out for
  themselves" and for their troops (rather than for the cause or
  nation of their paymaster), since without troop loyalty they had
  no means of personal advancement -- the most famous commanders,
  Ernst von Mansfeld, Wallenstein, Bernhard of Saxe-Weimar, the
  Swedish general Wrangel, all expected (and some received) grants
  of territory and titles of nobility as their rewards for service.
  The "national" armies of conscripts that came to the fore in the
  18th century was the answer to this problem. The pace of the war
  wound down during its last five years (although there were
  several major battles fought even then), which was a period of
  extended negotiatons in M&#239;&#191;&#189;nster and
  Osnabr&#239;&#191;&#189;ck, with the "final treaty" being signed
  late in 1648. For the next five years a series of conferences met
  at N&#239;&#191;&#189;rnberg to implement and enforce the peace
  treaty and to deal with difficult problems raised by demobilizing
  huge armies. Many of the loans of this period, which were raised
  to cover the demobilization costs, were not paid off for a
  century. Individual rulers such as Charles of Lorraine and the
  Duke of Savoy (who got nothing from the treaty) refused to vacate
  various fortresses for five or six years, but the war did not
  break out again. France and Spain continued at war with each
  other, but not in Germany. Numerous soldiers, especially
  officers, went into mercenary service all over Europe. Others
  took to the hills as professional bandits - for the next 20 years
  merchants traveled through certain parts of Germany and Bohemia
  in armed caravans. Wedgwood accepts the more recent (1900-1930's)
  historical estimate that the population of the Imperial German
  lands (excluding Alsace and the Netherlands) dropped from about
  21 million in 1618 to 13 million in 1648. The number of
  dislocated people was also substantial. While she acknowledges
  that the number of towns and villages destroyed and other
  "infrastructural" and economic losses were very large, she feels
  that all contemporary sources (e.g., the pamphlet literature of
  the next 100 years) exaggerated local losses, since all parties
  in the war continued to seek indemnities and restitution. The
  free peasantry benefited briefly, since landowners were desperate
  for manpower to restore their estates - prices fell while wages
  rose for a number of years, which increased the standard of
  living of peasants and artisans. But within a decade of the peace
  treaty the landowning gentry was pleading with Imperial, royal
  and local rulers to impose legal restrictions which would
  re-create bonded, serf-like conditions for peasants. Town
  councils now became pawns and bureaucrats of the dynastic courts
  of their rulers and also implemented restrictive legislations on
  peasants (e.g., prohibitions against mobility, domestic industry,
  and household craft production -- a trend which later historians
  refer to as "neo-serfdom"). Class stratification was as rigid as
  it was before the war started. There was a new, large class of
  mobile petty nobles and gentry seeking court-backed military and
  bureaucratic appointments, at the expense of town and peasant
  taxpayers. Germany and the Austrian-based monarchy and empire
  were totally excluded from the international competition to
  establish overseas colonies and from the developing "Atlantic
  trade". For a number of years the outlets of Germany's major
  rivers (Rhine, Elbe, Oder, and for Brandenburg-Prussia, Vistula)
  were controlled by foreign powers, reducing Germany's commercial
  strength. Hamburg was the exception, becoming the major maritime
  merchant city of the North Sea coast, at the expense of the other
  Hanseatic cities and the Scandinavian powers. The only
  medium-sized German state to emerge with positive prospects was
  Brandenburg, soon to become the administratively efficient and
  militarily powerful Prussia. The peace, while ending the "wars of
  religion", set the stage for a long series of "nationalistic"
  wars that subsumed dynastic and religious sources of conflict.
  France replaced the Habsburg Spanish-Austrian coalition as the
  menacing and tyrannical continental power willing to disturb the
  peace. Austria turned to the south and east and Spain lost its
  great power status and became an economic and cultural backwater.
  There was no politically or culturally unified Germany within the
  boundaries of the old Empire (French culture began to reign
  supreme) and the cosmopolitanism (its openness to outside
  influences) of this area during the 18th century, instead of
  being a source of pride over its achievements, became a source of
  lament for later cultural and ethnic purists of revived German
  nationalism. Author's Judgment and Conclusions: In terms of
  responsibility for the overall disaster, Wedgwood points to the
  futility and self-destructiveness of sincere religious zeal in
  the cases of Ferdinand II and the Elector Palatine. But, from the
  point of view of failures of practical (and ethical) politics,
  she highlights the behavior of Maximilian and Johann Georg, who
  could have prevented the spread of the conflict in 1620 and could
  have brought the war to an early end in 1635 if they had agreed
  to work together on a "unified German program" which would have
  forced Imperial compromises and concessions had they both stood
  behind it. Between these two she sees the Saxon as the greater
  victim of military circumstances (pressed by the Swedish
  juggernaut) and therefore less culpable for the mess, while she
  judges the Bavarian as too subtle and too ambitious in pursuit of
  his own dynastic and territorial ambitions at the expense of a
  general settlement good for his fellow Germans, thus identifying
  him as the more culpable. Beautiful in its style and concision,
  Wedgwood's final summary is also gloomy (as one might expect of a
  work completed in 1939, on the verge of World War II): "As there
  was no compulsion towards a conflict which, in despite of the
  apparent bitterness of the parties, took so long to engage and
  needed so much assiduous blowing to fan the flame, so no right
  was vindicated by its ragged end. The war solved no problem. Its
  effects, both immediate and indirect, were either negative or
  disastrous. Morally subversive, economically destructive,
  socially degrading, confused in its causes, devious in its
  course, futile in its result, it is the outstanding example in
  European history of meaningless conflict."</Text>

  Little Red Book". I enjoyed it so much that I had to apologize
  about my delay in submitting a positive comment on the seller's
  feedback page. But the book was that enjoyable! I read the book
  because I was told it is a good example in marketing and business
  management ideals. I don't even play golf! I was able to apply
  Harvey Penick's words to attitudes and approaches to life though!
  He not only teaches what he has learned about golf during his
  long rich life, but he also teaches a philosophy in how to live
  one's life. His methods of evaluating the actions of his students
  and sharing what he has learned in an effort to improve thier
  lives is obvious to me. He refuses to use negative impressions in
  his teachings. Instead, he accentuates the positive. He educates
  by guiding his students instead of "teaching" them. I love his
  ability to teach with images, parables and metaphors. His chapter
  "First Things First" about the golfer who wanted to get out of
  sand traps is great! After all, the problem is not always what
  you think. I challenge anyone to read "Harvey Penick's Little Red
  Book" and share with me how they can apply his knowledge to thier
  business and personal lives. Whether you play golf or not, this
  book is good reading</Text>

  <Text category="book">The book is not 'really' on Christ in the
  Etheric, but more several - "unrelated" - lectures about Etheric
  Life. Sometimes Christ only gets mentioned at the very end of a
  lecture. The book can be summed up as an accumalation of lectures
  of "cosmic life" if you like: the spiritual life that is
  connected with, and influences, life as seen only from/with
  physical senses. In the book is recorded about several "ages"
  (Golden Age, Silver Age, Iron Age and Dark Age), and that how in
  each age clairvoyant abilities - [or really spiritual
  consciousness] - diminished with each age, and that the Dark Age
  has ended in 1899AC and that in this current Age people need to
  become spiritually aware again to the point where they have a
  "Damascus experience" (experience of Saul - later Paul - in which
  he saw Christ in Etheric form). People who do not become
  spiritually aware will be bound into the Earth
  consciousness/sphere and could cause disturbances in the Earth.
  In this light, Rudolf Steiner communicated about the brotherhoods
  - in Western and Eastern countries - and how they try to prevent
  people from developing spiritually to the point where they will
  be able to meet Christ in the Etheric (= 2nd coming of Christ
  (coming in the Etheric)... and in future times coming of Christ
  (i.e. manifestation/presence of Christ in the astral)). In the
  book is also recorded about the Sermon on the Mount - with the
  Beautitudes (recorded in Matthew 5) where Jesus communicated
  about the development of the soul (as recorded in other books by
  Rudolf Steiner (sentient soul, intellectual soul, etc.)). In the
  book is also recorded about "the afterlife" if you like: life of
  souls who have passed away and are still Earthbound, and how
  those souls are connected to those souls that are incarnated in a
  physical body in Earth. In the book is communicated about
  different levels in the 'afterlife' and how feelings and will are
  active. It is recorded about astral plane, lower devachan and
  higher devachan in "Etherization of the Blood" and later on again
  in "Three Realms between Death and Rebirth" where is recorded in
  greater detail how activity in those realms is connected with
  life of souls incarnated in the Earth and how Christ is also
  present there and can be experienced in Earthly life as
  'destiny'... and how people are so focused on what is, or has
  happened, but don't pay attention to what is result of it not
  happening (e.g. getting delayed for an appointment, or coming
  ('unexpectedly') too early etc.). Destiny is at work, with Christ
  having its workings present in it according to Rudolf Steiner. In
  the book is also located about "the double" and how forces from
  within the Earth influence it [geo-biology]. Ireland was a place
  where those influences where most 'healthy' for spiritual
  development/cognition and Ireland was the place where
  Christianity was able to flourish and waver out from to Europe by
  Irish monks</Text>

  <Text category="book">First, the story takes place in the 1940s
  (Harold's brother is MIA in WWII, not in Vietnam, as the
  Amazon.com review erroneously states). Second, the writing is
  superb. Mr. Lawrence makes you feel emotions without telling you
  what to feel. His characters are very real. His setting (a small,
  struggling circus, traveling the western U.S.) is historically
  believable, peopled with 'freaks' who suffer as sideshows, unable
  to find any other way to live because of the bodies they were
  born with, but peopled also with 'normals' who are either afraid
  of or cruel to the freaks. Harold, the 14-year-old albino central
  character, tries to straddle both groups of people. He finds his
  niche in the circus as an elephant trainer. I am admittedly
  ignorant about such things, but Mr. Lawrence again makes the
  storyline with the elephants--crucial to the plot of the
  novel--seem believable. My only complaint about this otherwise
  very moving book has to do with the writing at a crucial death
  scene near the end. I do want you to read this book, so I will
  try not to give anything away here, but the writing at this
  important point becomes formulaic in the dying character's last
  words and even Gomer Pyle-like (People actuallly say "Gosh!").
  This did detract from the impact of the death, unfortunately, but
  I still very strongly recommend this book. Five stars for a book

  more generous to them than I would have thought from the initial

  Clockwork Orange" focuses on the nature of the individual in the
  future. Our protagonist is Alex, only 15 years old but already a
  habitual criminal, roving the streets with his band of friends,
  taking advantage of every opportunity to wreak havoc on the world
  around him. The boys have no qualms about attacking the helpless.
  In fact, the more helpless the victim, it seems, the more
  pleasure the boys take in the act. The most interesting and
  disturbing aspect is that the boys manage to maintain a strange
  sort of innocence even as they commit the most heinous and
  violent crimes. They aren't doing any of this out of malice
  toward their targets; in fact, it seems to matter very little who
  they pick as a victim. They are creating mayhem just because it's
  fun for them. Everything changes, however, when one particular
  break-in goes horribly awry and Alex finds himself sentenced to
  14 years in prison for murder. There, though he manages to create
  an illusion of good behavior, we see that the experience has no
  real impression on his sense of morality. Then, after two years,
  he is chosen for a new, experimental rehabilitation program,
  designed to rid him of any desire to indulge in, or even
  contemplate, any acts of violence. As we see, however, this
  "treatment" also leaves him without any choice in the matter of
  being good or not. He HAS to be good because he is programmed to
  be. This, of course, raises the question central to the book:
  Does good behavior actually mean you are a good person if you
  have no freedom of choice? The book can be a little difficult to
  get in to at first, predominantly because of Burgess's unique
  style. The story is narrated by Alex and thus, is written in the
  complex slang language, invented by Burgess for this book, that
  the youth of this society engage in. For example, a sentence
  taken from the opening chapter: "He looked a malenky bit poogly
  when he viddied the four of us like that" (pg. 5). There is no
  glossary, but if you stick with it, you will start to develop a
  feel for what most of the words mean after a couple chapters.
  However, if you find yourself having difficulty, a nice,
  comprehensive lexicon can be found on Wikipedia if you search for
  "English to Nadsat" (due to review guidelines I am not allowed to
  include a direct link). Unfortunately, it is alphabetized by the
  English equivalents, not by the slang terms, so looking up a word
  can be a little difficult. One final note of interest: The
  original British publication of "A Clockwork Orange" had 21
  chapters, as does the current American edition. However, when the
  book was first published in the United States, the last chapter
  was dropped. As Burgess explains in his introduction to the
  restored version, publishers considered this 21st chapter a
  sellout. Whether it is or isn't is up to you to decide, but I can
  tell you that the presence or absence of the last chapter makes a
  huge difference in the overall feel and message of the book.
  Without the final part of the story in place, the book offers a
  bleak message, implying that human nature cannot really change.
  On the other hand, reading the book with the final chapter in
  place gives us a little more hope. Beyond that, Burgess tells us
  in his introduction, interpretation is up to you</Text>
  <Text category="book">Renowned artist and tarot scholar/writer
  Robert M. Place has produced a masterpiece in his new tarot 384
  page companion book, The Buddha Tarot Companion: A Mandala of
  Cards. This book affords a rich unique perspective of the Tarot
  through the lens of the Buddhist paradigm. The companion deck
  comes in a beautifully illustrated box containing exquisitely
  designed cards that fit perfectly in my hand, a tiny black
  gossamer bag plus a bordered little white box with the
  instructions, "Embellish this box with protective and/or
  empowering symbols." Other suggestions that greet you as you
  begin your journey with the Buddha cards include: "Smudge with
  sage to cleanse and re-energize the cards after a reading." and
  "Store your deck with stones or crystals that absorb negative
  energy, promote healing, or provide protective energy." Also
  included in the box is a mini-book with guidelines on reading
  these particular cards. Both items are published by Llewellyn,
  who as always, have taken great care to ensure quality and
  aesthetics in the way the cards are packaged and presented.
  Robert has done an amazing job in correlating the life of the
  Buddha with the Tarot journey through the cards. He describes how
  the Major Arcana fits perfectly with the life of Siddhartha and
  his journey of enlightenment. Each of the tarot trumps is a stage
  on the mystic's journey to enlightenment. In fact, it is Mr.
  Place's belief that the creators of the Tarot were directly
  influenced by the life of the Buddha, and incorporated archetypes
  into the Major Arcana based on his journey. He teaches that the
  ancient wisdoms were not isolated from one another. Instead, "the
  classical world maintained communications with India and the
  ancient Western philosophers were familar with Indian
  philosophies." As well, the Islamic world introduced the
  Christians to the life of the Buddha during the Middle Ages. "The
  European Christians were enamored with the story, and they
  transformed him into a Christian saint - St. Josaphat." I was
  fascinated by the titles given to the Major Arcana cards. Each of
  the 23 cards reflect an important aspect of the Siddhartha's
  personal journey to become the enlightened one, the Buddha.
  Robert Place has created a deck and book that not only meets the
  needs of people who practice Eastern beliefs. He also acts as a
  mediator to help people of the Western world learn about and
  appreciate the noble tenets of Buddhism and its teachings for
  life. I highly recommend this deck - I found it very easy to
  follow, the graphics are amazingly detailed and artistically
  rendered and the companion book clearly helps you to learn to
  "read" using a Buddhist world view.</Text>

  <Text category="book">Though I usually go in for tough police
  thrillers, I sometimes mix things up by reading a light, funny
  mystery or- like this book- a quiet, thoughtful mystery set in a
  small town (a "cozy", I believe this type of mystery novel is
  called). "Still Life" nicely combines the easygoing attributes of
  a "cozy" mystery- quirky, eccentric characters, a small-town
  setting, pretty much no violence- with a little modernity, in the
  form of occasional well-placed profanity (though not much) and
  modern demographics (a gay couple is included among the main
  characters). The main detective character, intelligent and
  interesting, owes a little to Christie's Hercule Poirot, but not
  everything. The mystery itself is pretty interesting, too, though
  some aspects of its solution are a little broad and clunky, as
  are some of the explanations of why ultimately cleared characters
  were acting suspicious for a time. Any shortcomings are quibbles,
  however, and shouldn't deter one from trying out this nicely done
  mystery story set in a quiet little corner of Quebec</Text>
  <Text category="book">One reviewer claims that this is marred by
  some of Eliot's unfurtunate preducices. But how come you don't
  say something like that about O' Henry. We can't just stop
  reading authers because you we don't like their views. Someone
  calls hemingway looking forward? If that's looking forward I'de
  rather look backward. Hemingway has no concept of lyricism what
  so ever. Most of the people that reviewer named justly loved
  Eliot. Eliot is not looking nesscarily towards the past, but
  towards what we have made out of the present. In name of
  progress, we have destroyed nature and good part of our souls. To
  call Eliot Conservative at the time he wrote the poem would be
  redicoulous, the first draft according to one of Eliot's
  biographers, was absolutly a expression of Relavtism. One critic
  accused him being a Nihilist. On the Poem itself Eliot is truly a
  master at evocating mode and tone, not to mention his brilliant
  use of Imperfect rymthe. So it doesn't have the crepty
  sentimentalism and redicoulous forays of expression of eariler
  and later poets. So he looks at his poetry with a sense of hard
  classicism, we could use more of that. Yet what he doesn't right
  he evoces through mode and tone, giving us truly one of the best
  poems of this, or any other century.</Text>

  <Text category="book">Generally, my eyes glaze over as I reach
  chapter 3 of most business books as they provide the mastery of
  the intuitively obvious. Make Your Own Luck by Shapiro and
  Stevenson has broken the pattern. Written in punchy
  conversational style, the book is a delightful combination of
  anecdotes and useful tools geared to help the reader up the odds
  in personal and business decision-making. The process of setting
  goals and assessing risk is broken down into discrete aspects,
  allowing the reader to assess his own patterns of success and
  failure. This sounds as if it could be tedious, but it's not. The
  authors know you are not sitting in a policy course. They know
  that you make numerous bets in any given day and do it most of
  the time without focusing on the decision as a bet. The book
  makes you conscious of those bets and gives you the groundwork to
  move through those bets with speed and focus. In managing
  investments, I'm betting on a gestalt of macro economic factors
  and company specific performance as well as betting on the
  actions of other investors. The tools in Make Your Own Luck, such
  as the Prediction Map, are completely applicable to the
  inferential analysis I use in managing investments as well as
  life's major problems, such as how to seat guests at the next
  dinner party. This book is a good read. Shapiro and Stevenson
  incorporate topics from baseball to the Metropolitan Museum of
  Art. Make Your Own Luck makes you laugh, makes your think and
  gives you tools to improve your own lot.</Text>

  <Text category="book">IRONWEED by William J. Kennedy was the
  latest selection for a book club I've recently joined. The
  premise of the club is to read a novel and then view the movie
  (at the group meeting) that was based on the novel. As I
  expected, the movie paled in comparison to the book, despite the
  screenplay being written by Kennedy himself. Jack Nicholson plays
  the main character (Francis) and Meryl Streep is his "wanna be"
  socialite girlfriend (Helen), but this star power doesn't elevate
  the story beyond what Kennedy had already done in the novel. Set
  during the "Great Depression," IRONWEED is a great look at the
  underbelly of society: drunks, homeless, impoverished, and in
  that regard the story is timeless. I enjoyed the characters'
  quirkiness and the loosely connected plots, but more
  significantly to me were the themes of redemption, forgiveness,
  and love. The love aspect may be hard to spot, but it is there,
  unconventionally, in many of the character's interactions. This
  favorable recommendation comes with a warning: it can be a
  depressing read, definitely not a happy one, and while I found it
  inspirational, it will not conjure any blithe emotions. IRONWEED
  is definitely not a June beach read, being more apropos to a long
  winter night, indoor, by a warm fire.</Text>
  <Text category="book">This is a wonderful overview of a critical
  sector of the western front. Across the region known as Flanders,
  three particularly brutal battles were fought during the First
  World War with a horrendous loss of life suffered for minimal
  territorial gains. This book provides enough information about
  these battles to be informative yet unlike many military
  histories it avoids becoming boring because it is not overly
  detailed. It also discusses the battles from all perspectives
  including the high ranking politicians, the often inept generals
  but especially from the viewpoint of the poor infantrymen who
  suffered incredible hardships including shelling, bombing,
  machine gun fire, gas attacks and wretched weather conditions. In
  addition the author has a wonderful approach to writing making
  the book a very absorbing read that is difficult to put down. It
  is a shame so many historians, including such military writers as

  <Text category="book">I have written a lengthier review of this
  work elsewhere. But I did want to say to potential readers that
  the Peggy Antrobus book is a brief and welcome introduction to
  the global women's movement, that as such it fills a
  long-felt-want, and that it is to be recommended to those new to,
  unfamiliar with, or who feel they should be allied with, the
  women's movement. It would - it will - make an excellent text for
  those doing women's studies, as to those doing social movement
  studies, whether globally or more locally. Summarising, Antrobus
  shows the women's movement as political, as recognising women's
  relationship to social conditions, as processal, as posed against
  patriarchal privilege, as beginning where and when women
  recognise their separateness and even their alienation,
  marginalisation, isolation or abandonment within wider movements
  for social justice or transformation. One complaint, but which is
  much more widely spread than in this book alone. This is the
  avoidance of the word `capitalism' - even by feminists who are or
  were once socialists. Capitalism does not even get an index
  reference in Antrobus. Capitalists, mostly after all male, white
  and patriarchal, call it capitalism, and are proud of it. So why
  cannot it not be so named by feminists, who could and surely
  should condemn it? This cannot be solely because of their
  justified criticism of the archaic political-economic determinism
  of patriarchal socialists. So it has to be due to either a desire
  to be salonf&#239;&#191;&#189;hig (acceptable in the salons
  within which they have been speaking, to the funders they are
  dependent upon), or a restriction of their utopia to a kinder,
  gentler global capitalism, a global neo-Keynesian order - for
  which no convincing feminist case has been made. Pity</Text>

  coping with the brutal Minnesota winter when the unthinkable

  secret wife beater is found dead face down in Hannah's strawberry
  shortcake. His wife certainly has a motive, but is she the real
  killer? The police are inclined to think so, but Hannah certainly
  does not. With the aide of her sister, Andrea, she sets out to
  find the real killer. Many suspenseful twists and turns follow as
  Hannah and Andrea proceed on their relentless mission to free an
  innocent woman. Will they succeed and find the real killer? Only
  in the last few chapters will you find out the answer to this
  riddle. Once again, author Joanne Fluke has surpassed herself
  with another excellent novel. The cozy and inviting atmosphere
  found in the first novel continues here against the backdrop of
  the cruel Minnesota cold. Many delicious recipes are included so
  you can share the experience right along with Hannah and her

  <Text category="book">Luc Ferry raises some very important and
  pressing questions about the implied praxis behind deep ecology.
  Does the vision of society espoused by deep ecology depend on an
  authoritarian social structure? Does deep ecology demand a level
  of political correctness which places its premises beyond
  question? Ferry is not the first to raise these questions. The
  Institute for Social Ecology, led by Murray Bookchin, has made
  the critique of deep ecology its bread and butter. Of course,
  there are plenty of ideologues within radical ecology, but they
  do not make up the whole story. Particularly glaring is Ferry's
  one-sided depiction of eco-feminism. In fact, some eco-feminist
  work in the U.S. has been particularly sharp at questioning the
  orthodoxies of both radical ecology and feminism. The questions
  which occupy Ferry should be asked by every person who is
  involved in radical ecology, and many of his criticisms are
  on-target for a specific body of work. But he doesn't bother to
  see the whole picture, and readers should be careful to read
  beyond the quotes cited by Ferry and to study deep ecology and
  ecofeminism on their own terms</Text>

  attempted (which might be a good thing, after all!). If only

  <Text category="book">As I began to read this book, I was
  reminded of Jack Dempsey's observation that "champions get up
  when they can't." All of us have encountered professional
  setbacks of one kind or another and some of them are especially
  difficult to overcome. Most of the examples which Jeffrey
  Sonnenfeld and Andrew Ward cite in this book involve CEOs who
  either "fired back"and eventually prevailed after a career
  setback (e.g. Donald Trump, Martha Stewart, Bernie Marcus, Jimmy
  Carter, and George Foreman) or never fully recovered from them
  (e.g. Jill Barad, John Scully, Leona Helmsley, Jacques Nasser,
  and Linda Warnaco). The former demonstrate the importance of
  "seven lessons to turn tragedy into triumph" which Sonnenfeld and
  Ward recommend; the latter demonstrate the probable consequences
  of failing to understand and then apply those lessons on which a
  five-step strategy - "for rescuing and restoring a career and
  reputation after a devastating professional setback" -- is based.
  It would be a disservice to Sonnenfeld and Ward as well as to
  those who read this brief commentary if I were to list the
  "lessons" and "steps" which are best revealed within the
  narrative of this remarkably thoughtful, eloquent, and practical
  book. Each is anchored in a real-world context. Each is relevant
  to anyone now embarked upon or preparing for a professional
  career. I mention this last point because some who consider
  purchasing this book may incorrectly assume that its material
  will be of greatest value only to senior-level executives. On the
  contrary, all of Sonnenfeld and Ward's observations and
  recommendations can be of substantial benefit to anyone who
  wishes to (a) avoid "a devastating professional setback" or (b)
  recover from one. In essence, this book provides Sonnenfeld and
  Ward's response to this question: "How can I overcome a
  professional setback?" To their credit, at no time do they
  minimize or trivialize the impact of a professional setback.
  (Presumably each has experienced a few of his own.) They fully
  appreciate the difficulty of overcoming the debilitating
  psychological stress of failure, the challenges of failure to
  one's reputation (both personal and professional), social biases
  about failure, and other challenges which may be unique to one's
  company, its culture, and its industry. If not "tragic" or
  "devastating," a setback almost always lowers one's self-esteem,
  is embarrassing, and has adverse financial consequences. More
  often than not, there is collateral damage to one's family
  members and/or to one's close colleagues at work so guilt also
  comes into play. Recall the Dempsey quotation provided earlier.
  Presumably Sonnenfeld and Ward agree with Dempsey on the
  importance of courage and also with me that it is much easier to
  summon the courage to "get up" when you are convinced that the
  situation is not hopeless, and, that you can indeed recover if
  you understand what has happened, why it has happened, and how
  you can - and should -- respond to it. Of course, it is
  preferable to avoid a setback in the first place. ("If `ifs' and
  `buts' were fruits and nuts....") Most of us are not so fortunate
  and I, for one, have learned the most important lessons from
  failures (mine and others') rather than from successes. Whether
  or not a given failure is our "fault," it is certainly our
  responsibility to take full advantage of the learning opportunity
  it offers, and then to make positive and productive use of
  whatever truth has been revealed. It is interesting to examine
  the lives of "great leaders [who] rebound after career disasters"
  but, in my opinion, it is imperative to examine with rigor and
  candor one's own values, attitudes, and behavior - especially
  when struggling to understand and then recover from a
  professional setback which is invariably a personal setback,
  also. As Sonnenfeld and Ward make crystal clear, this journey of
  personal discovery is by no means easy. Nonetheless, it is one
  which must be initiated with commitment and then sustained by
  persistence throughout one's life. If and when setbacks occur -
  and they always do - the practical advice which Sonnenfeld and
  Ward offer in this book will enable those who absorb and digest
  it to understand and (yes) accept what has happened, understand
  why it has happened, and then leverage that wisdom effectively
  and productively, not only in their careers but in their personal
  lives</Text>

  returned from their mission on Gereon, a Chaos controlled planet,
  to Ancreon Sextus where war is also raging, in a continuation of
  the story of Gaunt's Ghosts. They have been changed which is
  frightening to those around them. They changed in order to
  survive on Gereon, but others think the transformation may be
  more sinister; therefore, they are put in internment camps and
  questioned. Finally, they are allowed back into battle as the

  which appears to be filled with the enemy. Not many people want
  to listen to Gaunt, even though he is an expert warrior with
  sharpened senses. Nothing is as it seems as the battle progresses
  and Gaunt must find a way to get his superiors to understand what
  he knows. Will Gaunt ever convince them that what they are seeing
  is not really what they are seeing? Dan Abnett has written a
  sequel to a story that I think you would need to read before
  tackling this one. After a spell, things did become clearer and I
  was able to pick up the storyline. The characters were well flesh
  out and the writing was smooth but the story did move a bit slow
  in places when some of the battles were taking place. There were
  many battles and a lot of dying on the battlefields. Strange
  monsters inhabited the land and only Gaunt knew where they came
  from. The monsters were fascinating in that they could not be
  killed in a normal way. Only Gaunt's Ghosts knew how to get rid
  of them. Reviewed by Alice Holman of The RAWSISTAZ

  across it again after so many years i felt compelled to buy it
  and read again. Oh Boy am i glad i bought it! Since last time i
  read it i have read many romance novels, many great one and many
  bad ones too. i thought i might not like it so much the second
  time around because of all the exposure i have got to romance
  novels since then but i was wrong. This book still made my heart
  race, made me smile at Joe's attempts to make Ronnie laugh and
  still made me sigh at that sparks of atraction flying between
  them. Joe's character was just amazing, and most endearing was
  his insecurities.Here was a Navy SEAL,one of the toughest
  possible guys, and he was insecure about his upbringing and
  background. He felt Veronica would be ashamed to be seen with a
  guy like him. He was sooooo sweet. He was so cocky, stobborn and
  arrogant but he was scared of rejection from Veronica. Just goes
  to show how a person's outward appearence rarely show what is
  really inside them. i can't find any more book of this series , i
  am still searching for them. i know i have to read all of
  them.</Text>

  <Text category="book">I give this book a 4 star rating, not
  because I believe in "The Necronomicon", but because this
  particular book has given some very interesting background and
  historical information on the occult scene in the 1970s. The
  Simon Necronomicon itself is an interesting tome (though I doubt
  it's "authenticity" per se). It is at least as valid a grimoire
  as any other, and more valid than some. "Dead Names" has provided
  a great deal of information on certain people whose backgrounds
  are generally not known as well as the unique "wandering bishop"
  phenomena and the so-called Slavonic Orthodox Church. Overall,
  both an informative and entertaining volume, whether you
  "believe" or not</Text>

  <Text category="book">Caine's book is by far the most practical
  book on acting I've read, and I've read a few. Some are very
  beautifuly written, poetic and psychological, but for someone who

  recommend this book first. It is at times bleakly honest but
  highly readable. If you've done any acting, you'll find yourself
  nodding frequently</Text>
  <Text category="book">This is the second book in the Wind Dancer
  series. The Wind Dancer being the first, which was excellent. I
  almost feel as if I liked Storm Winds even more than The Wind
  Dancer, and I believe it's due to a more comprehensive, abundance
  of history. I was absolutely and totally absorbed with this book
  from the first chapter until the last one. The characters were
  very individualistic and intriguing. I have to say I enjoyed the
  romance more between the two supporting characters: Catherine and
  Francois, more than the main characters: Juliette and Jean Marc.
  I was enamored by Francois and his strength, steeliness, and
  sensuality. Jean Marc was a dark, handsome man as well. Because
  of the way Juliette was treated in her youth, I see why she was
  so desperate for someone to need her; hence her demanding,
  take-charge attitude to care for her friend and others. Catherine
  was a delight. She was soft, caring, and sweet, but her terrible
  experience made her strong and even more beautiful in nature.
  Fascinating characters and historical background. I would
  recommend this book to all those who love romance that isn't the
  typical,dull Harlequin type and a love for important historical
  eras.</Text>

  to be a DaVinci Code knock-off, but gave it a shot since I

  it injustice; this is definately not an imitator and is worth
  reading in it's own right. I enjoyed the characters, plot, and
  switching between the past and present. I'm not sure it has
  literary value (I wouldn't argue that The DaVinci Code does,
  either), but it's certainly complex enough to make you think
  about the plot and character relationships without being
  difficult to follow</Text>

  <Text category="book">I have been planting flowers from seed in
  my home for almost 5 years now. Last year I had over 1400
  seedlings on multi-level shelves under flourescent and natural
  light in my dining room. (Boy do I need a greenhouse!) So this
  book was not a lot of new information to me. A lot of what is
  listed can be found on the back of a seed packet, but it's not
  practical to sit on the floor of my favorite garden supply store
  and read every seed package for suggestions before I buy it.
  (This is important, because I'm not interested in refrigerating
  my seeds 3 weeks before I plant them or doing other such
  preparations required for some seeds.) One major thing missing
  from this book was photography. There were drawings, but I'm
  sorry to say that they were mostly a way of breaking up the
  monotony of the text rather than a reference tool. On the good
  side, this book did an excellent job of providing the proper
  germination environment, and each plant had a quick reference in
  a shaded box that listed the type of plant (annual, perennial,
  etc), its hardiness zone, and its flowering season. This allowed
  me to quickly eliminate the plants that were inappropriate for my
  zone. The regular index wasn't very useful, but one wonderful
  addition was an index of the common &amp;amp;amp; latin names. I
  refer to this when looking at some of my books that include the
  full color photography I was missing. (Almost makes up for
  it....almost!) Of course, there is the standard hardiness zone
  map, but they also added a map each for the probable first and
  last frost dates. (Nice!) Also included was a directory of seed
  companies and their addresses. All in all, this book does a good
  job of covering the seed part, but a poor job of covering the
  bloom part</Text>

  <Text category="book">As a Social Worker in private psychotherapy
  practice, I find that sometimes the work can be isolating and at
  times I question whether I should make more of an effort to
  consider the latest trends in psychotherapy. Mary Pipher affirms
  that the classic skills that make a good therapist such as
  compassion, empathy, listening skills, reframing and the ability
  to induce a sense of calm are timeless. Furthermore, even if I
  wasn't a therapist I think I would still devour this book because
  her writing is a pleasure to read. I highly recommend it for
  anyone just starting their career in therapy or those who have
  been in the field for decades. This book is bound to become a

  something; this is not the case with this book! The programming
  of a robot is everything... and behavior based programming is the
  only way to go. This book provides a very good intro into that
  very subject. The only complaint I have is not about the book but
  his robot simulation program on is website which is referred to

  <Text category="book">Alien invasion stories have been done to
  death since H.G. Wells gave us The War Of The Worlds so it is
  extraordinarily difficult to come with a new slant to this
  time-honored genre. Well, William C. Dietz pulls it off with
  Death Day and the concluding volume Earth Rise. What sets Death
  Day apart from most of the invasion tradition is, first of all,
  the invading force being made up of different races. This makes
  an interesting dynamic and gives the enemy character as their
  squabbles, in-fighting and fight for freedom (some are slaves to
  others) make for something new, different and engaging. Also,
  using racism amonst the aliens as well as the surviving human
  population rings a true, and tragic, note. The surviving pockets
  of humanity withdraw within themselves, close off their borders
  and horde resources. The aliens favor people of color and place
  them as overseers as human slaves are forced to work building
  alien temples on Earth. And, sadly, collaborators work with the
  invading force to control the humans. But the seeds of rebellion
  have been planted. Humans and enslaved aliens are fighting back
  and this first book sets up an alliance between the enslaved
  races. All this is interesting stuff and makes for a fresh
  approach. I enjoyed this book and recommend it highly. Dietz is
  the best SF writer working today when it comes to letting
  character drive the story no matter the setting.</Text>
  <Text category="book">Harvey E. Goldberg is one of the pioneering
  sociologists in the study of the Jewish communities of North
  Africa, especially the Libyan-Jewish community. In this present
  work he brings to bear the experience and knowledge of a lifetime
  of study and practice as a Jew to provide an overall historical,
  anthropological view of the Jewish life- cycle. He opens with a
  chapter on 'Being Jewish' then considers Birth, Circumcision,
  Naming . He goes on to discuss 'Rituals of Education' and then
  has a central chapter on 'Marriage'.An especially innovative
  section is on 'Pilgrimage and Creating Identities'In this one he
  opens one of the central themes of the book, the way the
  increased importance of the Individual in Jewish life and thought
  has led to more varied religious practice. His chapter on 'Death,
  Mourning and Remembering' also includes a consideration of
  communal remembrance. This is not as might be expected his
  closing chapter, as he adopts the traditional teaching which he
  is reminded of by one of his many interviewees, and ends with
  something 'good' His final chapter is on 'Bonds of Community and
  Individual Lives'. This book is extremely well written and a
  delight to read. I especially enjoyed the instances where he
  brings in personal anecdote to illustrate and deepen a set of
  observations. Goldberg has a true command of traditional Jewish
  religious sources, and these texts form one real basis of his
  life. But what is especially exciting is his reading the communal
  variations across time in response the religious and communal
  demands. As one long familiar with much Jewish tradition and
  ritual I was surprised again and again by new observations and
  insights. Anyone who loves Jewish learning will love this work
  tremendously. I cannot recommend it more highly</Text>

  <Text category="book">James Moseley was the stereotypical rich
  orphan trust-fund kid, inheriting millions while still in
  college. He promptly left college and attached himself to a
  shady, Indiana-Jones-style South American graverobber. The
  graverobber wanted for some reason to do a book on the flying
  saucer myth, then only a few years old. Moseley was sent
  crisscrossing the US to interview anyone and everyone who had
  made contributions to that myth in the period 1947 - 1954. The
  book never materialized, but Moseley was left with extensive
  notes, and the indelible and accurate impression that, apart from
  a few people who had genuinely seen something in the sky they
  didn't recognize, and would have been expected to if it were
  anything familiar, the majority of the mythmakers were, as my old
  Grandma used to say, "crazy as a betsy-bug." Over the years
  Moseley kept his hand in, meeting and interviewing anyone who
  came onto the scene in what he sometimes calls The Field, other
  times (more accurately) "ufoology." He edited and published a
  long series of saucer fanzines and newsletters and still
  publishes one to this day. He met everyone and he shrewdly sized
  up everyone. He organized many flying saucer conventions and
  seems to have attended most of the others. Here's his
  information-packed account of about 48 years in The Field, and
  there is no more accurate word-picture anywhere in print in
  english (I've looked!) of the classic early 1950s contactees led
  by George Adamski, on to the 1960s abductees led by Betty Hill,
  on to the growth of the crashed-saucer myth from its humble
  beginnings with the 1949 Scully hoax, on to the full-blown
  Roswell hoax of 1985 - 90, and on to the "supernatural" abduction
  stories of the 1990s. Moseley was an eyewitness to the birth of
  many hoaxes, a few of which he perpetrated himself. Highly
  recommended, as a true insider's look at this nearly 60 year-old
  and seemingly immortal myth of "things seen in the sky.</Text>
  <Text category="book">Mark Liberman and Geoffrey K. Pullum could
  be accused of making the best of an already satisfactory
  situation in publishing this book that reiterates their ongoing
  blog on linguistics. But for this reader, having never visited
  their blog (until now), this book is a treasure trove of quips
  and oops and pooh bahs and evidences of the strangely twisted
  manner in which we communicate. Written in a casual style that
  makes the faux pas revelations more cogent, the authors share
  embarrassingly poor writing from the media, from authors, from
  those in control of the country (as though the mentality of the
  US might somehow be reflected in the malapropisms of George W.
  ...Yikes!), and yet reading this blogline of information never
  seems vitriolic. Criticism is one of the most substantial ways to
  create change and hopefully this book and blogline will focus
  many minds on the misuse of the English language, perhaps
  effecting some much needed corrections. FAR FROM THE MADDING
  GERUND (didn't you always wonder why Thomas Hardy used that word
  in the title of his great novel 'Far from the Madding Crowd'?) is
  a book to pleasure the mind - and humor - and a fine resource for
  perusing before writing or speaking to a group of wise souls. So
  maybe it is a print form of a blogline, but for those of us who
  tire of wading through the computer for reading, it is a complete
  (?compleat?) pleasure! Grady Harp, June 0</Text>

  PI. The premise of this series, a young woman private detective
  who has strong psychic abilities which she uses to solve cases,
  is original and fun to read. Abby is a psychic, but she also has
  the same trials and tribulations of a normal young woman, money,
  sibling and romance issues. In this latest book, Abby, her sister
  Cat, and Abby's handyman Dave, buy and plan to renovate a house,
  only the house turns out to be haunted! Poor Dave, Abbey's
  partner and handyman, is attacked by his own chainsaw as he
  begins the renovation! Determined to find out what's going on,
  Abby begins investigating the history of the home and discovers a
  missing treasure with ties to WWII Nazi Germany. In order to
  solve the mystery, Abby depends on her spirit guides to help her
  on the case. There is danger for Abby and her friends from an
  unknown stalker and the romance between Abby and Dutch becomes
  more intense as they each must sacrifice some of their
  independence to become a real couple. Ms. Laurie has a great
  series going here, and I look forward to reading more Abby

  <Text category="book">It is interesting to see how golems evolve
  from Pratchett's Discworld novel, "Feet of Clay" (1996), where
  they are speechless slaves of clay, to "Going Postal" (2004)
  where a well-educated but humorless golem serves as body guard
  and lecturer-in-morals to the new Post Master. This is where it
  all begins... Commander Sir Samuel Vimes, of Ankh-Morpork's Night
  Watch pays a visit to the Dragon King of Arms at the urging of
  his new wife, who thinks Sam needs his own coat-of-arms now that
  he's been knighted. Unfortunately, one of Sam's ancestors was a
  regicide so his descendent is denied an armorial bearing by the
  College of Heralds. He does learn that one of his watchmen is
  actually the Earl of Ankh: the inimitable Corporal Nobbs, who is
  forced to carry around a piece of paper signed by Ankh-Morpork's
  Patrician certifying that he's really human. Well, this is a bit
  of a come-down for Sir Sam, but he's got more important matters
  on his mind, including the murders of two harmless old men. One
  of them was beaten to death by a loaf of Dwarf bread. His body
  was discovered by Captain Carrot and Corporal Angua, the only
  werewolf in the Night Watch, when they visited the Dwarf Bread
  Museum on their day off. The only link between the two corpses is
  a trace of white clay at both murder scenes. Subplots zigzag
  every which-way through "Feet of Clay." Corporal 'Earl of Ankh'
  Nobbs is being courted by a group of well, nobs who haven't given
  up on the notion that Ankh-Morpork should be ruled by a king.
  Captain Carrot, hereditary king of Ankh-Morpork who wisely
  refused the crown in "Men at Arms," is busy tracking murderers
  and emancipating golems. Sargeant Colon is about to retire if he
  lives through a trip through the sewers with Wee Mad Arthur.
  Corporal Angua helps a new dwarf recruit come to terms with her
  yen to wear lipstick. Death, who has at least a walk-on role in
  all the Discworld fantasies is still working on his sense of
  humor: "I AM DEATH, NOT TAXES. I TURN UP ONLY ONCE." If this
  sounds confusing, it isn't. It's brilliant. All of the story
  lines tie together according to character. I don't know how
  Pratchett digs through the sewers and stockyards of Ankh-Morpork,
  and rubs together a monarchist plot with a bit of animated clay
  to create such a gem. I think he must use magic.</Text>

  <Text category="book">Bailie draws on Rene Girard's theory of
  foundational violence as the generative cultural force, and
  explores its modern effects on a culture no longer enthralled by
  ritual or sacralized violence. I found especially compelling the
  newspaper accounts of violent acts which have taken place within
  my own memory. Bailie uses these along with historical accounts
  of scapegoating to illustrate his theory, producing a
  hard-hitting indictment of all forms of violence, whether
  isolated actions or legalized responses to a violent act.
  Increasingly, I find it difficult to distinguish between an act
  of violence and an act of retributive justice. I have not read a
  newspaper account of a violent encounter the same way since
  reading Violence Unveiled, nor do I react to photojournalism with
  my previous detachment. The impact stays with me, despite the

  <Text category="book">This is the second novel in the mystery
  series featuring Marcus Didius Falco, an informer and sleuth. A
  series of books that have become hugely popular, so much so that
  the author is now at the forefront of historical mystery writers.
  It was probably a stroke of genius on her part to have novels
  that are extremely well researched and contain all the elements
  that would be and should be found in Rome in AD70, but to have a
  lead character who has the vocabulary of a present day New York
  cop. In this novel the hero Marcus Didius Falco has returned from
  the remote island of Britannia, a god forsaken place whose people
  are morose and surly and the weather, well the weather is best
  left to its own devices. Marcus has lost his heart to senator's
  daughter Helena but is not sure that the passion he feels is
  reciprocated. Why is that women he is not interested in, fall
  over themselves to get to him, but the one that he has lost his
  heart to, treats him with a cool disdain? He has not long
  returned to the welcoming arms of Rome before a series of fatal
  accidents and things that go bump in the night convince Falco and
  the Emperor that there are traitors still conspiring and they
  must be brought to book. Falco is not happy, it seems he must
  leave his beloved Rome yet again, but the conspirators are
  serious about their plans and will not let anyone stand in their
  way. Will Falco ever return . .</Text>
  <Text category="book">I did a course on quantum theory in the
  1970s with John Ward who was recommended for the Nobel Prize in
  1965 (Feynman, Schwinger and Tomogana shared it). Those close to
  the action will know of Ward's Identity. John (died in 2002 from
  memory) used Feynman's lectures as his course notes. I must
  confess a soft spot for Feynman. I would have loved to have been
  in his lectures (buy his audio tapes and you will get the feel
  for his delivery). He was truly a great physics communicator and
  often understated his mathematical abilities (after all he had
  won the Putnam Prize at some stage so he was no mathematical
  slouch). His development of QED is simple to understand and that
  says it all about his genius. He took the view that if he
  couldn't give a simple explanation then he really didn't
  understand the topic. The current crop of tool polishers should
  heed this. Anyone who is really serious about physics (and maths)
  should read the original papers and this is a classic example. I
  suggest that you fill in the gaps in the derivations. If you
  can't do that then you haven't really understood it. It is
  fascinating to compare Feynman's approach with Schwinger's more
  abstract approach. I prefer Feynman's but Schwinger does a hugely
  impressive job in stripping QED down to its logical (almost truth
  functional) essentials. Buy this book and see how a first class
  mind works. Peter Haggstrom BONDI BEACH AUSTRALIA</Text>
  <Text category="book">(3.75) The other reviews can reveal what
  this book is about. What I wanted to share is the extreme
  responses this book incited in my boyfriend and me. He
  alternately found himself loving the narrator, Yuriko's sister,
  for her brutal honesty and hating her for her malice and
  psychological bullying of Kazue. Meanwhile, I found myself
  rooting the narrator on as she spoke the cruel truth about the
  pitiful hopelessness of Kazue's meritocratic dreams, but a moment
  later I wondered if that made me a bully myself or as bitter and
  heartless as the narrator. Perhaps it reminded me too much of
  what I had seen growing up to shock me. Then, there was the
  simultaneous hilarity and pain of Kazue's cluelessness. Was she a
  tragic figure, blind, or both? I admired Kirino for inspiring me
  to feel so much for her characters, even for Yuriko, who is
  certainly not the ditsy airhead her older sister wants us to
  believe she is (I also found it hard to believ she was as ghastly
  as she considered herself in her 30s: is it just because women
  past 25 in Japan are regarded as Christmas cake, as a friend from
  Japan says?). My attention was quite strained by Zhang's tale of
  Chinese hardship (it seemed the wrong book to educate the reader
  about how difficult it is for immigrants in Japan), but I
  immediately forgave Kirino when Yuriko's older sister admitted
  herself Zhang's account was tedious and could be skipped (I'd
  recommend others to skim it as well). Again, my patience was
  tested by Kazue's journal: I just kept on thinking, aren't you
  ready to die yet? But I see this was intentional on Kirino's
  part, to make the reader struggle between our (or my) wanting
  Kazue to just give up on life and our feeling ashamed for our
  coldness and complicity in her bullying. It also made my
  boyfriend and me think concurrently of the people we loved in our
  own lives who were heading towards the same fate as Kazue and
  Yuriko, not through prostitution but through drugs. What did
  disappoint me in the end was the last chapter, which seemed a
  cop-out. If only an editor had suggested it was unconvincing and
  encouraged her that an alternative, though more shocking, would
  be more in line with the narrator's character, but that is
  wishful thinking on my part. When I give this book to others,
  which I will, I will make sure to discuss with them, when they've
  finished, what they thought of the ending. This book could have
  been edited down a hundred pages (back when it was written in
  Japanese), but for what it did offer, I have no regrets for its
  consuming my attention entirely and will always look forward to
  further translations of Kirino's books. This book may not be the
  masterpiece "Out" was, but for anyone who has gone to an elite
  school on scholarship, striven to remain a petite zero, wanted to
  excel while recognizing how off-the-mark our values of judgment
  are, or wondered just how much her body could be worth, reading
  "Grotesque" is just as powerful an experience as reading "Out"

  <Text category="book">I think this is the best book that I have
  ever read. I thought that the Civil War was very, very boring but
  when our class started to read Bull Run I knew that I was wrong.
  The way that Paul Fleischman writes he would leave you wanting to
  read more. From the way Paul Fleischman described the characters
  to the words that Paul Flesichman use to set the tone of the
  characters he just seem to draw a cool picture of what is going
  on in your minds eye. Each character has a different story of the
  war and of life. I would suggest this book to anyone who is
  learning about the Civil War. It supplies you with a lot of
  information you might not get in the history book and tells it in
  a way that makes you want to learn. This book was excellent from
  the first page I read. Even though this novel is very brilliant,
  some people might not like it. If they can not wait to know what
  happens to a favorite character, like one of my favorite
  characters Dietrick Herz. He had the funniest voice I ever heard.
  When Paul Fleischman leaves you hanging he really leaves you
  hanging. But the only way to find out the ending is to read the
  entire book and find out what happens for yourself. And trust me
  it will be worth your while this truly is a magnificent book. The
  best that I have ever read and if I liked it then for surely you
  will love it too, trust me. Before I read Bull Run I had only
  read books with one or two characters and this type of book was
  really, really new to me. I had to get use to it a little but
  since it wasn't very hard to read it only took a short time to
  adjust to the Bull Run story by Paul Fleischman. Some of the
  characters that I really liked was Toby Boyce because he had a
  good attitude on trying to learn how to use the fife. Another was
  Carlotta King because she had a very spunky voice in this story
  like how the Yankees would get rid the of the law so that the
  slaves could be free and be in control of there own religion and
  what I mean by that is they can practice there own religion.
  Another one of my favorite characters is Vergil Peavy. I think
  that he was my favorite character because of the way he sounds in
  the story. In the story he sounds like he's from Texas also the
  way how he talks about the war like they were the big war heroes.
  And my last favorite character is Shem Suggs because he was the
  lonly one who likes to talk about horses and to horses also what
  they are like who they should be with. Shem Suggs is the person
  who takes care of all the horses, that he watches pretty much
  like baby sitting the horses. But the reason I really really like
  him is because he minds his own business and doesn't talk to
  people about the war and the politics all he talks to are his
  friends which are the horces. That is the reason why I like Shem
  Suggs the best out of all the other characters the best because
  he is smart</Text>

  <Text category="book">Yes, Ben Witherington is a (relative)
  conservative, but don't hold that against him. Yes, he has strong
  opinions, but don't hold that against him, either, because they
  are well argued. The fact remains that this is the best overview
  of &amp;amp;quot;Third Quest&amp;amp;quot; Jesus scholarship I
  have been able to find. Admirers of the Jesus Seminar may not
  appreciate his critique, but it is very fair and well-thought
  out. One of the benefits from a book like this, besides giving
  interested parties a launching pad for further research, is that
  the different views of Jesus can help one achieve a well-rounded
  portrait of the Savior. No one scholar gets it right all the time
  (not even Witherington, with his own view of Jesus as God's
  wisdom), but the different insights are valuable, because Jesus
  is bigger than what any one person can comprehend. That should be
  a cause for humility (something some Jesus scholars have lacked,
  at least in print). I highly recommend this book for anyone
  interested in contemporary Jesus scholarship</Text>

  <Text category="book">What do you do when the world is coming to
  an end right before your very eyes, but no one seems to believe
  you? That is the concept facing Dr. Thomas More, distant relation
  to the famous/infamous Saint Thomas More, in Walker Percy's novel
  "Love In The Ruins". The United States is at a time of crisis,
  but few seem to understand the implications of the events
  unfolding around them. It is up to Dr. More, who knows how to
  diagnose the problem, but not necessarily treat it, to try to
  prevent the chaos from happening. The story begins on a hot
  fourth of July, with Doc staking out the abandoned Howard
  Johnsons motel in town. In three separate rooms he has cocooned
  his three paramours and he is waiting for an event that he knows
  is going to happen; an event that could very possibly bring about
  the end of the world. The novel then shifts back in time to the
  three previous days, tracing Doc's journey that led him to seek
  refuge at the motel. The reader learns that he has created a
  Ontological Lapsometer, a sort of "stethoscope of the human
  spirit", through which he can diagnose exactly what ails a
  person's soul, and finally discovers how to treat it. Meanwhile,
  there is a revolution brewing; the Bantus and love children are
  ready to take over what the white man has destroyed, if a major
  catastrophe doesn't befall everyone before that can happen. "Love
  In The Ruins" is a truly southern novel, crafted through Percy's
  intelligence and tempered with the same absurdity that is a
  trademark of great southern writers such as Percy and Flannery
  O'Connor. The reader must suspend disbelief as to the events
  unfolding, even though they are frighteningly realistic, and not
  so far-fetched in this present day. Percy's hero Doc More is an
  antihero on par with those of Hemingway; flawed, prone to drink,
  forever chasing after women who are wrong for him. This novel is
  his coming-of-age, in a sense, because Doc learns what it is he
  wants out of life, and how to best achieve that. Subtitled "The
  Adventures of a Bad Catholic at a Time Near the End of the
  World", "Love In The Ruins" is a deliciously funny and poignant
  look at a near-apocalyptic America</Text>
  <Text category="book">I first heard this story as a part of a
  sermon given to a congregation of mixed ages. The children were
  enthralled with the illustrations (as were many adults) but the
  &amp;amp;quot;message&amp;amp;quot; was deeply felt by the
  &amp;amp;quot;older&amp;amp;quot; child in all of us there. It is
  the message that no one really knows how much influence they
  have. Mole was just doing something that really intrigued and
  interested him, and brought him pleasure. He wished that he could
  influence others, but never knew what his music did for the
  world. Maybe this is true for each of us as we pursue what we
  really have a passion for. The message is true for children and
  adults alike. I will share this with my young 8 year old

  <Text category="book">I should first confess my bias--I have
  often been tickled and sometimes awed by Mortimer's way with
  English prose for 20 years. So, in picking up this book I had the
  high expectations one might have before meeting an old friend or
  beloved teacher. No disappointment. Even if some of these essays
  are slightly less effervescent than others, all are at least
  wonderful, and several are both brilliant and touching. Mortimer
  has given us a collection of short essays, conversational and
  often wryly funny, which he intends as a kind of spiritual
  bequeathal to his family and other heirs. The chapters range
  across a broad range of subjects, some perhaps outwardly
  frivolous, like the cooking of eggs. But in the main, Mortimer
  touches on matters of great substance--the nature of beauty, how
  to be happy, surprising ways in which our world has managed to be
  unjust, places and times for sex, how to dine sociably, the love
  of children, faith and reason, the terrors of the writer facing
  blank paper, and many more. I found these essays to be wise and
  absolutely delicious. I suspect that readers who have enjoyed
  Rumpole, or Mortimer's other biographical essays like Summer of a
  Doormouse, or Clinging to the Wreckage, will be quite pleased
  with these sketches. Mortimer may, sadly, be nearing the end of
  his life, but at present he seems to be on a literary tear. I,
  for one, wish him many more prolific years</Text>

  <Text category="book">"Doctor Livingstone I presume?" is
  undoubtedly one of the most well known quotes in history. Very
  few people, however, are familiar with the history underlying the
  meeting of Dr. David Livingstone and Henry Morton Stanley. This
  book details the lives of the two men and the historical
  background through which they were thrown together. Livingstone,
  one of the foremost explorers of his day is searching for the
  source of the Nile River. Through a combination of bad luck, poor
  planning, disease, weather, natives, etc., Livingstone is
  virtually stranded on the banks of Lake Tangyanika. Henry
  Stanley, a newspaper correspondent undertakes a rescue mission at
  the direction of his publicity hungry publisher. This book
  details that mission and the international setting under which it
  took place. The perils of African exploration in the late 19th
  century cannot be overstated. This book does an excellent job
  impressing this upon the reader. I found this book very similar
  in style and experience to Undaunted Courage (which detailed the
  Voyage of Discovery undertaken by Lewis and Clark) and River of

  <Text category="book">For over three years I've been studying
  Buddhism and Zen. During that time I've ordered many books within
  the different Buddhist schools. There are many fine authors out
  there that explain the tenets and fine workings of Buddhism as
  well as Zen. I believe a solid background in Buddhism background
  is essential in understanding Buddha's message to mankind.
  However, the true "nuts and bolts" of Buddhism practice can be
  found most directly in Zen. It is one thing to know something
  about a religion or way of life yet it is another to be able to
  apply it. Ezra Bayda has most succinctly given the best
  instruction of how to apply Zen to one's life where we need it
  the most; during those moments when we are gripped with our core
  pain. Core pain is comprised of our anger, traumas, sadness,
  feelings of inferiority, etc. It is this core pain that can make
  our life a living hell. Ezra examines these emotions and teaches
  us how we can mindfully learn to transform them in a way that
  truly works. Instead of denying them or trying to escape them we
  learn that they are part of our path in life. And while it takes
  courage to be present with these emotions we learn that they are
  but old programs and often ancient belief systems that take us
  away from the genuine life we all deserve. At least one reader
  has referred to this as being like a self-help book. Yet anytime
  we look for truth whether it be in religion or psychology, aren't
  we looking for something to help us. Ezra offers us the tools to
  achieve transformation in our life. When I ordered this book I
  had hoped it would teach me how to truly apply Zen teachings to
  my life. What I didn't realize is that the information this book
  contains would exceed anything I have read in any religious book,
  psychology book, or college text. Another reviewer said "Where's
  the Zen" in reference to the contents of this book. "The Zen" is
  there on every page. While Ezra doesn't use the esoteric style of
  writing common in Zen/Buddhist teaching, his simple clearcut way
  of communication exemplifies the simpleness that Zen is truly
  about. Ezra's other two books "At Home in the Muddy Water" and
  "Saying Yes to Life" are excellent as well and deepen your
  understanding of living mindfully and in the moment. A helpful
  hint, read his three books in chronological order with this book
  first. Personally, I think that reading them in order adds to a
  person's understanding and that each book acts like a foundation
  for the next. Ezra Bayda I have not had the honor of meeting you
  personally yet I thank you most sincerely for the gift of your
  writings. I bow to you for you are a Master! There are many of us
  I'm sure that are looking forward to your future works. Two other
  excellent Zen books that teach mindful living and dealing with
  difficult emotions are "Beginning Mindfulness: Learning the Way
  of Awareness" by Andrew Weiss and "At Hell's Gate : A Soldier's
  Journey" by Claude Anshin Thomas. Also, the writing's of Thich
  Nhat Hanh, a great man who highly influenced both of these
  authors, teaches the art of mindful living in a very
  understandable manner. Good luck to you on the path.</Text>
  <Text category="book">This was an astounding book about an even
  more astounding woman, Rachel Shilsky, a.k.a Ruth McBride Jordan.
  Written by one of her 12 children, James, this book is both
  biography (mother) and autobiography (child). A Polish Jew
  (white) who fled her oppressive surroundings in backwater
  Virginia, Ruth met and married two different black men and
  managed to raise 12 children in some extremely difficult
  circumstances in Harlem, New York. Not only did she start a
  Baptist Church with her husband, she coped with a regular dose of
  racism, some significant poverty and still managed to send 12
  children to school (all of whom became professionals, and
  productive citizens). The book is written by the son, but the
  voice of the mother is registered throughout (in italic print).
  She evades all queries about her background, her family, in fact
  any of her history, and it is not until much later that the son
  uncovers her history (abusive father, crippled mother) and the
  reader is even more impressed with the fortitude and will that it
  must have taken this woman to make her own life in a community
  that was not of her economic, racial, or religious experience.
  Although the book is ostensibly about this man's childhood and
  his remarkable mother, it is also a fascinating glimpse of
  racism, religion and social exclusion in the black communities in
  New York in the 1960s. Each of Ruth's children experienced a
  certain unease about their racially `different' mother and yet
  each became aware of who they were and what they were about. This
  book is just a marvelous read. Full of funny and sad tales of a
  rather unique family life, McBride's work is a tribute to his
  extraordinary mother.</Text>

  <Text category="book">The opening of The Mauritius Command brings
  us some changes, especially for Captain Jack Aubrey, who finds
  himself in the improbable role (for him) of husband and father of
  twins. Unsuccessful and hapless in his domestic life, he
  immediately jumps at the chance to leave England and take over a
  new command. Off the coast of Africa, Jack is promoted to
  commodore, putting him in command not just of his own ship but of
  a small fleet. In the course of the book, Jack stretches his
  abilities to the fullest as the British vie with the French for
  possession of several small islands crucial to controlling the
  India trade. Of course, Dr. Stephen Maturin is on hand too. His
  facets as doctor, naturalist, and spy all come into play in the
  course of the novel. The previous novel, H.M.S. Surprise,
  involved incredible physical suffering, loss, and rejection for
  Stephen so it was nice to see him get a break in this
  installment. However, Stephen is still haunted by what has
  happened to him. A dark current runs through him that no doubt
  will resurface in future books. The overriding issue explored in
  this novel is leadership and what it means to be a good leader.
  Jack has to deal with two very different captains serving under
  him, one of whom is a silly and vain man who is kind and familiar
  with his men and thus beloved by them. The other is a brave
  commander who exercises brutal tyranny with those under his rule.
  The weaknesses of both men lead to very different disasters. In
  spite of the battles and some serious turns of event, The
  Mauritius Command involves more action and comedy and less angst
  than H.M.S. Surprise, making it a lighter read.</Text>

  <Text category="book">Generations of hate come together in this
  book. Pete Braga killed Franklin McMichael dead in a claim of
  self-defense in the summer of 1952. The next generation carried
  on the tradition when Gabriel McMichael supposedly beat Pete's
  son, Victor, so severely that he suffered permanent brain damage,
  rendering him with the IQ of a ten-year old. The third generation
  was na&#239;&#191;&#189;ve to all this hatred when Thomas
  McMichael fell in love with Pete's granddaughter Patricia. The
  love of his life was driven away at a young age when Grandfather
  Pete refused to permit their love to blossom. While the McMichael
  family existed in near poverety, the Braga family thrived in
  power and money. So now Thomas has a problem. The root of all his
  family's hatred, Pete Braga, has been found dead. He was murdered
  by someone at his home. Thomas has been assigned the case to find
  out who wanted the old man dead. Given his many enemies, the list
  of suspects is long. It doesn't help that the first suspect,
  Sally Rainwater...Pete's personal nurse, becomes the object of
  Thomas' heart as the investigation unravels. The story twists and
  turns through many leads and many unexpected plot points as
  Thomas McMichael is determined, despite his family's hatred of
  Pete, to find out who is behind the killing and why. Author T.
  Jefferson Parker does an excellent job in keeping the reader
  involved and interested in the story with his enthralling style.

  <Text category="book">Going to Barsetshire is a delightful book,
  and a much-needed accompaniment to the Thirkell novels. Ms.
  Snowden obviously spent a great deal of time reading the 29
  novels in Thirkell's Barsetshire series, and has produced a
  companion to the series that makes it very easy to keep track of
  the characters, places, and cultural references, especially for
  an American who is not well versed in mid-20th Century English
  esoterica. I also enjoyed the writing style and the well-chosen
  quotes. In addition to the book's comprehensive content is its
  straightforward layout and user-friendly format. This exemplary
  reference guide is not a flashy publishing house production, but
  instead keeps with the simple charm of Barsetshire in its quality
  and overall appearance. The original cover art, showing an
  idyllic Barsetshire scene, is lovely. I heartily recomend the
  book to all Thirkell fans</Text>
  <Text category="book">We are in the last part of the 19th Century

  - two Mountain Men, and No Ears - an Indian with exceptional
  eyesight). McMurtry relates a sad, elegiac farewell to times
  past. The ever-interesting characters and their views of the

  <Text category="book">Did we need a Gore Vidal reader? The author
  is something of a long-winded blowhard, commenting at length (and
  I mean LENGTH) on every topic imaginable. In that respect he is
  America's Voltaire, creating reams of comment and interpretation
  on politics, the arts, and religion and morals. It's hard to say
  where Vidal fits in the framework of 20th century criticism, as
  he is not a conventional leftist. Because of his iconoclasm, this
  collection can only inform the reader about Gore Vidal, not his
  times nor any intellectual or political movement. All that said,
  Vidal is a great essayist and a droll wit. This book is much too
  much for the casual reader -- stick to one of his many shorter
  collections instead -- but for a Vidal fan (or, say, a reader of
  &amp;amp;quot;The Nation&amp;amp;quot;) this book is worth the

  <Text category="book">Lately there has been a lot of talk about
  how great Ronald Reagan was as a president. This book shows that
  this is not even close to being true. Under his presidency we
  went from the number one loaner to the number one debtor in the
  world. Him and his administration sold missles to Iran inexchange
  for hostages and then illegally took that money to support
  Contras in Latin America. Under his administrations hands off
  approach wall street ran wild with illegal and immoral practices.
  All this happened while his administration held down the poor and
  middle-class while giving the rich more money. It is debated
  whether Reagan knew some of these things were happening hence the
  title of the book. It is a very good read and easy to fly through
  the whole book. The only complaint about it is the lack of an
  indept description of the savings and loan scandle and the
  dredded star wars program. Recommended for anyone intrested in
  learning what happened behind the scenes of this
  presidency</Text>
  <Text category="book">a very difficult topic to cover, but one
  which is broadly researched and well presented</Text>
  <Text category="book">This book provides a good and clear
  overview of the subject of MySQL. This is a thick book that
  covers a lot of material. The last Chapters even provided
  introductions to application development with C, PERL and PHP.
  MySQL: The complete Reference really seemed like an actual
  complete reference. While it may not go to deep into every
  subject it does at least briefly cover each topic. Most of the
  focus was on SQL (Structured Query Language) though. There were
  only a few minor issues with this book aside from minor
  grammatical errors. For one thing, you would occasionally have to
  modify the sample tables before you could even start the
  exercise. Also, it would have been nice having more sample tables
  and data so I could follow along in more of the examples.
  Frequently, my result set wouldn't quite match the one in the
  book. Additionally, some of the command wouldn't even execute or
  would return an error message. Lastly, the chapters on
  development were pretty useless unless you are already familiar
  with one of the languages. But, I believe many of the above
  problems where because of version differences and the fact that I
  was running MySQL on windows. Although windows instructions were
  given as well the book examples were still more oriented towards
  a UNIX installation. Also, MySQL would be several versions newer
  on my computer. I believe that made a difference on some of the
  results as well. And for windows administration its better just
  to use one of the suggested GUI programs since many of the
  commands were difficult to run from the command prompt. So, I
  wasn't quite able to follow along with all the examples for one
  reason or another. Nevertheless, there were still plenty of
  quality examples I could follow along in. In addition, there was
  still a lot to learn from just reading through the material.
  Overall, this book works well as a reference or for working the
  Chapters in order. Even though the book's user level isn't
  indicated I believe it provides a fine introduction for a
  beginner.</Text>
  <Text category="book">After a quick internet search I found many
  reviews on Amazon as well as several other sites for this book
  and called in an order for it at my local Barnes &amp;amp; Noble
  that same night. Dr. Whitley has written this book in the most
  responsible and informative way without having to charge his
  readers for individual sessions! In my opinion this is a must
  read not only for parents of underachievers but also teachers and
  counselors. We have always tried to stress the same learning
  structure and goals as the teachers. However, if at home you are
  on Dr. Whitley's 10-step track and the teachers are still on a
  reward and punishment system - the parent needs to be proactive
  in dealing with the teachers and endeavor to obtain their support
  as a united front. Although the steps may seem to be a cumbersome
  process at first read and initial implementation - the constant
  image of "Mr. Rogers" in the back of my mind is quite calming and
  thus the process can become a destressor for the parents. Of
  course, that may not be so for those parents of hard cases where
  the child is at the stage where he/she is capable of
  "frightening" resistance. Obviously, professional help with
  someone in-tuned with Dr. Whitley's methods would be more
  advisable than his book! To me - this book is for the parents of
  students in 6th grade or less - and possibly 7-8th graders. These
  kids still have some moldability and aren't as likely to have
  other serious issues that could be the source of the problem
  (i.e. depression). For the grammatically correct - the substance
  of the content of the book far outweighs any such errors that are
  more the fault of the editors than the author;0)</Text>

  <Text category="book">"The Climb" was written by Bourkeev and
  DeWalt as an answer to Krakaur's "Into Thin Air". While not
  showcasing the same prose as Krakaur's book, I feel that this is
  utlamitely better. My reasoning for this opinion is that "The
  Climb" seems like a much more fair and unbiased account. Bourkeev
  does not resort to playing the blame game; he simply tells the
  story as he experienced it. Krakaur, it seemed to me at least,
  relied to heavily on assumptions, and we all now what happens
  when you assume (hint: you make an _____ out of you and me) and
  came off as very arrogant and (for some reason) took a feverious
  dislike to Bourkeev and Lopsang. Thought not as well written as
  "Into Thin Air", "The Climb" still managed to draw me in fully,
  although some parts of the book are a little confusing, mainly
  the interview with Bourkeev about his single handed rescue of
  three striken climbers who otherwise would have surely perieshed.
  This interview was conducted in English, the only problem with
  that is that Bourkeev's English is not very strong! It is
  passable and most of the time you can understand him but in other
  parts it is very hard to dechyper. DeWalt tries to help by adding
  "translations" about what Bourkeev is saying but I felt the
  interview should have been caried out in Bourkeev's native tongue
  of Russian and then translated into English. To not have done
  this is a great injustice to Bourkeev. If you want to read a fair
  and unbiased book about the May 1996 Everest tragidy that was
  written simply to tell the truth and not to play smeer tatics and
  make money (as Krakaur's clearly was), read this. I really
  recommend you read both books, though and also check out the IMAX
  movie "Everest".</Text>

  enterprise using "butter bugs", a genetically engineered bug that
  produces an edible tofu like substance. [Miles calls it "Bug
  Vomit"] Mark wants to help Kareen Kouldelka earn her way back to
  a Beta Colony school where he and she can continue exploring
  their relationship without cultural impediments. Ivan Vorpatril's
  strait forward plan, [Ivan isn't known for 'cunning',] is to

  that. Lord Dono has a cunning plan. But who the heck is Lord
  Dono?? Surround the whole story with the pending marriage of
  Emperor Gregor and the Lady Laisa, and the Vor are dropping like
  flies on bug butter. This Vorkosigan adventure has no military
  campaigns, no threats of death, [well...not really.] It does have
  all of the intrigue and mess-pionage that you could expect with
  the over abundance of cunning plans. You'll suffer for Miles, and
  then cheer at the inevitable outcome. Ekaterin is no shrinking

  <Text category="book">Moral Consciousness and Communicative
  Action is the primary anglophone source for Habermas's writings
  on &amp;amp;quot;Discourse Ethics.&amp;amp;quot; Written in the
  early eighties, this translation, which was published in 1990,
  provides a developmental perspective. The focus of the essays
  moves from Habermas's statements about the role of philosophy
  today, in &amp;amp;quot;Philosophy as Stand-in and Interpeter, to
  his writing on reconstructive social science in general, to his
  program for a discourse ethics in particular. The final papers
  address criticisms of this program. The volume suffers a bit from
  the fact that Thomas McCarthy's introduction is keen to locate
  Habermas's position vis a vis various contemporary
  moral-philosophical standpoints, but does not go very far toward
  locating the whole initiative in the broader canvas of Habermas's

  <Text category="book">This book is for anyone who has ever
  questioned their faith, lost a loved one, or yearned to
  understand life just a bit more. Sarah Darer Littman has captured
  Justine Silver, a confused Jewish girl, within the pages of
  CONFESSIONS OF A CLOSET CATHOLIC. Justine is surrounded by her
  faith, but no one seems to celebrate it the same way. Her parents
  have one idea, her grandparents another. And then there are all
  those other religions -- which way is the "right" way? Bewildered
  by this, Justine seeks answers by deciding to adopt her best
  friend's Catholic beliefs. With the help of Father Ted (a stuffed
  animal), a secretly purchased rosary, and a "stolen" cross
  necklace, Jussy turns her closet into her own private
  "confessional". What will happen when her family finds out?
  Littman humorously and compassionately shows the readers
  Justine's life as she struggles with her religious questions, her
  neat-nick mother, and, sadly, the death of her beloved

  Justine, but they will definitely know they are not alone in the

  <Text category="book">It is basically a short review of the great
  book written by Zahn. I recommend the novel and this as a
  refresher for later times</Text>
  <Text category="book">I once read an article in Horn Book
  Magazine (a review source of titles and articles on children's
  literature) that lamented the millions of poor translations of
  Hans Christian Andersen polluting the minds of our young people
  today. The review mentioned that stories like, "The Snow Queen",
  which were originally written in a snappy vernacular, have been
  dumbed down and drained of all energy by their American
  translators. With this idea fresh in my mind I found myself in
  possession of a very particular copy of "The Snow Queen" and I
  was able to test this theory myself. Now due to the wacky nature
  of Amazon.com, the website has lumped together the reviews of
  every single version of this Anderson story. You will see that
  some of the reviews refer to Nilesh Mistry's, some refer to the
  audio book, some to Eileen Kernaghan's, and some (God help us
  all) to Mary Engelbreit. None of these, however, are the version
  that I am reviewing. After careful consideration, I selected the
  edition retold by Amy Ehrlich and illustrated by Susan Jeffers.
  The Ehrlich/Jeffers team has banded together to bring us every
  fairy tale from Thumbelina to Cinderella. With this 1982 classic
  edition, they bring all the creepy and crawly elements of
  Andersen's riveting tale to a kind of tame middlebrow life. Most
  people don't remember that "The Snow Queen" begins when the devil
  creates a mirror that reflects everything good as bad. By a quirk
  of fate the mirror is smashed one day (the details of this
  accident are left unclear) and the tiny pieces go spinning into
  the atmosphere. If these splinters enter your eye, everything
  will look ugly to you. If they enter your heart, it will turn
  instantly to ice. Got it? Good. Cause sure enough, two small
  pieces enter the eye and the heart of a boy named Kai. When this
  happens he stops playing with his best playmate Gerta and instead
  falls under the seductive spell of the mysterious and
  magnificently pale Snow Queen. Gerta goes in search of her friend
  but is waylaid by a variety of different adventures. She escapes
  an overly loving old witch, is taken in by a prince and princess,
  falls into the power of a thief girl and her kin, and at last
  saves Kai from the Snow Queen herself. By the end of the book,
  neither kid is a child any longer and their home is just as they
  left it. Obviously "The Snow Queen" is one big ole story about
  growing up. The idea of the devil's mirror causing someone to
  despise anything they see and grow a suddenly cold heart... well
  that's just another way of describing adolescence, is it not?
  Andersen obviously borrowed quite a lot from that classic old
  tale, "East of the Sun, West of the Moon", in which another girl
  goes off to save the man she loves from the machinations of a
  wicked woman. Heck, "Tam Lin" was probably an influence as well.
  The best version of this particular story I ever read was by Kara
  Dalkey. It was a tale named, "The Lady of the Ice Garden" and can
  be found in "Firebirds: An Anthology of Original Science Fiction
  and Fantasy". It is not, however, appropriate for children. Kids
  today will probably look at "The Snow Queen" and instantly think
  of the White Witch from "The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe".
  I cannot think, however, that this is a bad thing. As for the
  Jeffers/Ehrlich version, it's all right. As an illustrator,
  Jeffers has apparently decided to make Kai and Gerta definitely
  children. I guess that lowers the creepiness factor when the Snow
  Queen lures the boy to her sleigh and wraps him in her furs.
  Jeffers really captures beautifully every diamond in the Snow
  Queen's dress and every strand of her white white hair. There is
  the odd stylistic choice here and there, though. When Gerta
  surprises the prince and princess in their bed, it is not your
  typical mattress affair but rather large his and her flower
  petals. I can't think that they're comfortable (or even
  particularly practical). The illustrations have been created,
  according to the book, "using a fine-line pen with ink and dyes.
  They were applied over a detailed pencil drawing that was then
  erased". As a result, the book is as soft as a colored pencil,
  but with a level of detail and intricacy normally associated with
  pen and ink. Obviously I don't know enough about the original
  version of "The Snow Queen" (or, as Andersen called it,
  "Sneedronningen") to know whether or not this book is a worthy
  version to read to your tots. At any rate, it tells the full
  story, warts and all, and will provide them with what may well be
  the most Freudian-toned fairy tale ever to grace their little
  brains. A fun edition of a rather odd tale</Text>

  the original texts, complete with all the archaic but fascinating
  English spellings. The texts are fully annotated with comparisons
  and references to a wide range of cognate works. If you are
  reading the Cambridge Platonists as part of an academic exercise
  or are otherwise familiar with their milieu, well and good. You
  will know what to expect. I think it is worth saying something
  here - for the general reader. I am sufficiently 'unmodern' (or
  perhaps 'un-postmodernist') to read the Cambridge Platonists
  because I think they still have something valuable to say! Not
  everyone would agree with me - but, I think the portrait of
  Benjamin Whichcote which graces the cover of this book (and the
  frontispiece) says something about the sort of men we are dealing
  with. (The portrait still hangs in the gallery at Emmanuel
  College, Cambridge). There is composure in that expression. It
  seems to infuse the whole being of the man. It is the expression
  of a mind which has found calm waters, seen eternal verities. One
  of the papers in this book - Ralph Cudworth's, was preached as a
  Sermon Before the House of Commons (i.e. the British Parliament).
  Things are different with us today. We are no longer certain of
  eternal verities. It seems almost incomprehensible - now, to
  think that when the Cambridge Platonists were expounding their
  ideas in the 17th c., they were touching on matters of concern to
  most thinking people. Religion and science had not yet parted
  company (despite being called a 'father of modern science' in
  school books, Issac Newton was a deeply religious man, very much
  in tune with the ideas of the Cambridge Platonists). The great
  beauty of the Cambridge Platonists, is their calm confidence,
  their utter conviction that there are eternal verities, that
  Reason and Faith are complementary faculties. Thus, on the one
  hand, they looked back to the philosophers of antiquity (strictly
  speaking, they are Neo-Platonists, taking in everything between
  Plato, Plotinus, Ficino/Renaissance thought, even Hermeticism) -
  and the legacy of Christianity, while on the other hand - they
  were alive to the emerging 'scientific' spirit, the renewed quest
  to understand the principles ordering the phenomenal universe.
  For them, there was an Intelligent - and intelligible order in
  the universe. For them, Reason (capital R) still had its
  pre-Kantian, classical sweep. 'Reason' was not a mere idea in the
  head, an itching in the cranium, but presupposed the divine Nous
  (intellect), intimately connected with the activity of a divine
  energy (energeia)informing the pattern of the universe. We find
  them preaching against false religious 'enthusiasm' - as soundly
  as they preached against atheism. "Good men spiritualise their
  bodies; bad men do incarnate their souls. " "We are no more than
  Second causes; and our Suffiency is only in God, who is the
  First. A Second Cause is no Cause, divided from the First. " -
  Benjamin Whichcote.</Text>
  <Text category="book">This book covers all the elements of Game
  Theory, emphasizing intuition over mathematical formalism. The
  philosophical aspects are also given a thorough treatment. The 8
  appendices provide a more formal exposition of several key
  concepts such as the Minmax Theorem, the geometry of equilibria
  and Linear programming. The book has not changed much since its
  publication in 1957, but it is by no means archaic. Even for
  those who have a modern and more rigorous textbook,
  &amp;amp;quot;Games and Decisions&amp;amp;quot; is Highly

  <Text category="book">This is by far my favorite novel by
  Forster, and many rereadings have made it one of my favorite

  lightness of touch which I, at least, feel that he lost as he got
  more self-consciously &amp;amp;quot;philosophical&amp;amp;quot;
  in later books like Howard's End and A Passage to India. He makes
  wonderful use of the Italian settings and of Italian art,
  bringing them to vivid life, undermining tourist cliches, and
  weaving them gracefully into his main themes. No other book I
  know balances romanticism and irony so perfectly</Text>

  <Text category="book">Peter Balakian's book, "Black Dog of Fate,"
  tries to be too many things and sadly fails at many of them. In
  essence, it is an attempt to tell a sort of Armenian-American
  story which I find not overly interesting or compelling. I wish
  the author had done a bit more in-depth work to learn about his
  people and their rich heritage before embarking to represent it
  or explain it or share it with non-Armenians, for he has much
  more to absorb and understand himself first. I find the
  Armenianness in this book to be tentative, unengaged and
  unconvincing. Pity, since the author seems to have a lot of
  passion in his pursuit of other aspects of his life such as
  football, the Yankees, modern poetry, and exposing Turkish
  attempts to buy (among others) Princeton professors to act as
  mouthpieces giving legitimacy to their vile historical
  revisionism, practiced by the "modern" Turkish state and its
  organs. It seems to be all the rage these days to elevate
  personal histories and family testimonials into the realm of
  fiction and novels. The "I" and "we" and "us" occupy center stage
  and the reader is invited to enjoy the intimacy that must surely
  be in place via this artifice. But is it realy? Since in order to
  make this legitimate, the writer must distance himself, at least
  initially, from all this old world exotica, and like the reader,
  question their validity or relevance in present day North
  American society. What are all these old world, old fashioned
  ghosts and traditions?, is the first cry of writer and reader
  alike, only, ofcourse, to be followed by a sharp bank turn where
  the writer steers the satisfied and in-place reader towards the
  opposite viewpoint wherein *this* culture and *this* lifestyle
  become suspect in light of some tentative spotting of cultural
  wealth that has been traded in or abandoned in order to swim
  swiftly towards materialistic, memory-free, self-redefining,
  "comfort" seeking and buying mores. In the Balakian tale, one
  encounters suburbia instead of substance, worldly goods
  acquisition instead of deep roots that steady the soul, immediate
  family and relatives running away from their true identities
  either towards surrealism, the abstract and unemotional, or else
  towards medicine, respectability and detachment. Young Balakian
  observes but never understands "the grandmother" for she is
  shielded culturally from being able to reach him by her very
  offsprings who can not and will not instill the Armenian identity
  he will eventually seek but never quite find. Their crime is
  self-denial and a march to the tune of America's mixmaster piper.
  "Be unlike your past and your future will be brighter," seems to
  be what America promises, at the very least. The intermediate
  generation listens and adopts this credo and Peter is left to
  find out but never quite understand just what cost his ancestors
  have paid to remain Armenian and to preserve our culture before
  the final denials on New Jersey pateos while enjoying, as if to
  serve sweet irony, full course Armenian meals and the mixing
  aromas of delicacies from the old country every Sunday. Peter is
  lost alright, but as the book sadly shows, he remains lost.
  Paraphrasing or quoting Ambassador Morgenthau does not an
  Armenian genocide expert make. Personal family testimonials of
  the Turkish atrocities does not a genocide history make (For
  that, read Vahakn Dadrian's "The History of the Armenian
  Genocide" Berghahn Books, 1995). Episodic accounts can be
  dismissed by the Turks as hear-say and as mere isolated
  incidents, leading to more harm than good (for if better evidence
  existed, the arguement goes, why would anyone resort to such
  flimsy fare?). For the story to have worked, for the story to
  have *really* worked, as I would have liked it to, Balakian's
  life and lifestyle would have had to have changed significantly
  and his child rearing practices would have had to reflect it, and
  his relationship with his wife who, like him, is not leading a
  strongly Armenian existence, would have had to have changed,
  solidifying his roots, celebrating his new found identity, and
  nurturing the metamorphosis by sustained community involvment and
  grass roots movement participation which, alas, never appear on
  the pages of this book. How else to explain the lack of a turning
  around of the tide of assimilation to which Balakian is a grand
  personal witness, except that the transition has not occured? The
  ship of Armenianness sails by Balakian. He is finally aware
  enough to be able to identify the ship and wave it goodbye and
  write about it, but not resolved enough to climb aboard. That is
  how the book fails and that is how his story fails. This is a
  story of assimilation and loss with a bit of mid stream self
  awareness thrown in. For a real story of an Armenian finding his
  roots and letting them take root in his own life and future, read
  Mark Arax's book, "In my Father's Name (Simon &amp;amp; Schuster,
  1996)," where the transition is real and the early youth of
  disaffection is replaced by a profound adoption of our essence
  revealed in exquisite frankness and power by Mark Arax. One can
  only hope that Balakian's partial reorientation towards our
  culture and traditions and essence will somehow continue and that
  some day he will wish to live with a more meaningful attachment
  to our cause and needs than merely as an able observer (not
  withstanding his laudible actions as an April 24th -- Armenian
  genocide commemoration speaker and an exposer of Turkish
  infiltration in the US academic arena by buying spokesmen turned
  professors who mascarade as unbiased researchers). This criticism
  I direct to the predecessor of this genre of American Armenian
  writing first and to Balakian second. I speak here of "passage to
  Ararat" by Michael Arlen (Hungry Mind republication, 1996) where
  a disinterested soit-disant Armenian goes to Armenia in the 70's
  and by the end of the short trip is somewhat more closely touched
  by this strange people's woes and dreams. Too little, too late,
  and always detached, is all I can say to these meagre displays of
  ethnic or cultural reorientation. Much more needs to be absorbed
  before the essence is transmitted to future generations to take
  and behold. However, I remain hopeful that future transformatory
  stories and ethnic identity survival stories *will be* written
  which will show that the tide of assimilation and cultural
  abandonment are not the only outcome of this experiment of
  transplanting peoples and cultures to this continent we proudly
  call our home</Text>

  <Text category="book">"Typee" is based on Melville's experiences
  when, as a young man of 22, he "jumped ship" from an American
  whaling vessel on the island of Nukuheva in the Marquesas Islands
  of the South Pacific. It is written in a straightforward
  narrative manner, but it is a work of fiction, NOT a journalistic
  report, something that is often overlooked. While, like "Moby
  Dick", it contains lots of factual details, mostly quite accurate
  as confirmed by subsequent research, it is a much more complex
  tale than it appears to be on the surface. For a first novel,
  written when Melville was only 27 years old, the narrative power
  is quite impressive, as for example in his description of the
  escape from the ship over the mountains to the Valley of the
  Typee. In the early chapters, themes of peace, beauty, and
  sensuality are combined with Melville's righteous indignation at
  the activities of Western military and religious intruders to
  create the illusion of an earthly paradise. Gradually dread,
  loneliness, horror, and fear of annihilation come to the fore, as
  "Tommo", the protagonist, becomes convinced that he is being kept
  for eventual eating at a ritual cannibal feast. He is finally
  rescued almost by chance, and because of conflict among the
  Typees. I read the Oxford World's Classics paperback edition,
  which has an introduction by Ruth Blair, an Australian professor
  of English. It was very helpful with Melville's historical and
  literary sources and the geographical and cultural context. The
  chapter on "Typee" in "Studies in Classic American Literature" by
  D.H. Lawrence adds a further depth of understanding. Newton
  Arvin's biography of Melville helps to place "Typee" in the
  development of Melville as a writer. Highly recommended in its
  own right as a superb example of 19th century American
  romanticism, with hints of the impending metaphysical explosion
  of "Moby Dick"</Text>
  <Text category="book">I first purchased this book when I was a
  freshman in college seven years ago. It is without a doubt the
  best and easiest reference guide to writing I have ever read. I
  love the plastic tabs that mark each section. This guide is easy
  to read and follow it is organized in basic steps that are
  categorized accourding to section. So for example if you need to
  find out how to cite a web page or a video tape, etc using the
  MLA style you just flip to the section called doucmentation
  clearly marked with a plastic tab. I have since purchased an
  updated guide for myself and also bought one for my brother - a
  freshman in college. I really wish I had this book when I was in
  high school. I highly recommend this book to any high school,
  college, graduate student or writer. I especially recomend this
  book for students with learning disabilities, I myself have ADD
  and before I got this guide I could not understand how to write a
  paper in the MLA style or in any style other than a book report.
  I promise this is the easiest reference guide to writing ever

  <Text category="book">Has there ever been anyone like Richard
  Nixon? For sheer resiliency,he stands alone in American history.
  No one won bigger than Richard Nixon. And no one lost bigger than
  Richard Nixon. And then won again. And then lost. And won again.
  He just kept punching and planning and working, to eventually
  become one of the dominant figures of the 20th Century. The
  author of 9 books, 8 of them best-sellers, this is his first,and
  covers six major crises of his political life to 1962. This is
  serious history, but so well-written that it reads like an
  exciting novel. In it, you can see the raw steel of the man
  emerging through his discipline, beginnig with his first crisis
  as a 35-year-old freshman congressman,the prosecution of Alger
  Hiss, the darling of east coast liberals and the state
  department, as a Soviet spy.. The other crises have been
  well-described by other reviewers, but all were thrilling
  examples of courage (backed by preparation) under fire.
  Highly-experienced Washington veteran David Gergen, who worked
  closely with four Presidents, in his excellent book "Eyewitness
  to History" described Richard Nixon as "the toughest man I ever
  knew". In this book, you can see why. Interestingly, his
  overwhelming love of country shines through as well. For
  example,the 1960 election was unbelievably close.A swing of only
  11,000 votes properly distributed, and the election results would
  have been reversed. And there was verifiable vote fraud by the
  Democrats, especially in Texas and Illinois. Nixon was repeatedly
  urged to demand an investigation and recount. He refused.
  First,it would have greatly delayed the transference of
  responsiblity to a new administration. But secondly, as he wrote,
  "Then, too, the bitterness that would be engendered by such a
  maneuver on my part would,in my opinion, have done incalculable
  and lasting damage throughout the country." There speaks a
  Patriot. And a Man! Also recommnended."Nixon in Winter" by Monica

  <Text category="book">I'm in love with The Impressionists in
  general and with Auguste Renoir in particular. His palette is
  full of light; soft pink, greens and blues are a joy to watch
  time and again. As most Impressionists Renoir paint wonderful
  every day scenes, mainly outside as his magnificent: "The
  Luncheon of the Boating Party" (1881), "The Swing" (1876) and "Le
  Moulin de la Galette" (1876), whose careful reproductions are
  shown here. He was an artist that loved life and wanted to
  reflect it as he perceived: full of little moments of simple joy
  and relax. He was also a masterful portrayer as you may see from
  his "On the Terrace" (1881) in the cover of this book or "Two
  Girls in Black" (1881). Another subject that attracted his fancy
  was the dancing couple, which he depicts with tenderness and
  accuracy. It doesn't matter if the dancers are from the high
  class as in "City Dance" or commoners as in "Dance at Bougival"
  both from 1883. At the end of his life his paintings evolve and
  produce for our delight: "Seated Bather" (1914) and "The Nymphs"
  (1918). His life and works are described and commented by the
  author with keen penetration and endearment. Reproductions are
  awesome and do justice to the Artist. Do not miss this book!

  <Text category="book">This was a required text for one of my
  graduate courses and I didn't expect to enjoy it much. It wasn't
  far into the book that I began to resonate with some of the
  struggles for racial harmony articulated by Perkins and Rice. In
  Chapter 1, Spencer Perkins states emphatically, "The Civil Rights
  Movement has run its course, and we've gotten just about all you
  can expect to get from a political movement." I, a white guy,
  took offense at the thought that someone would declare the
  struggle for civil rights obsolete. His point is well made
  through the development of this and subsequent chapters. The move
  toward reconciliation must move from race to grace. Regardless of
  your religious affiliations, if you are engaged in civil rights
  causes or racial reconciliation you would be remiss to neglect
  this ground-breaking tome. PAX Erik</Text>

  <Text category="book">This very fascinating book is a story
  written in the form of numerous letters and personal diary
  entries made by the principle character of the book. It
  chronicals the life of a young Scottish woman forced to live
  first in China then Japan. Well written and historically
  accurate, it's obvious the author is intimately familiar with the
  the culture, customs, history and life style of Japan. This makes
  the book that much more interesting and fascinating for those who
  enjoy realism and demand accuracy in a story. For all who've ever
  lived in Japan, it's a believable tale that literally makes you
  feel you've stepped back in a time machine to witness the birth
  of modern Japan. For those who haven't lived in Japan, believe
  that the author has done his homework and is not simply just
  creating a fictional setting in his mind. Because of this, he's
  able to focus on his character versus scene/setting development
  and thus creates a living breathing person in your mind. The
  timespan covers over 40 years as the story weaves through her
  trials and tribulations, and shows how her fortitude and strength
  serve her through tumultuous events in her life. A gripping tale
  that draws on your emotions and has you constantly rooting for
  her. When the last page is read it leaves you wishing the story
  would continue, but even good books must end. Be prepared to sit

  <Text category="book">I bought this together with a "best of" CD,
  both containing a lot of songs I really wanted to play on the
  piano myself. That combination has allowed me to hear what Vince
  played while also reading through the music to see just what it
  is he played. Without exception, I've found the written music
  exactly true to what Vince recorded, including pick up notes,
  tricky min-maj-min progressions, arpeggios, diminished 9th
  chords, and what-not, and it has made some previously
  unapproachable passages much easier to understand. I've also been
  able to use the book as a sort of learning tool, getting a feel
  for what a jazz musician really tries to accomplish when he sits
  down and plays a piece. I would like to have seen some fingering
  indications included, and without those, I think some beginners
  will not be able to do much with this work. And personally, I
  didn't find the performance notations particularly useful ("laid
  back" doesn't really convey much to me), but like I said, I also
  purchased a CD of Vince's music, so I already have an idea of
  what sort of sound I want to achieve. Other than those two minor
  points, I can't find anything wrong with this edition. The
  binding is "lay flat" perfect bound, so the pages stay glued
  together but pull away from the spine, allowing this book to
  retain a crisp appearance and feel even after the pages are

  <Text category="book">Drummer Hoff is an unusual story that uses
  repetitive phrases and rhyming to tell the story of Drummer Hoff,
  the man who "fired it off." In this story, a group of men are
  preparing to fire a cannon. Each man brings something different.
  One man brings the barrel, one man brings the carriage, and at
  the every end of each stanza it says "but Drummer Hoff fired it
  off." This story uses childlike drawings to demonstrate the
  pattern of rhythm in the story. The colors are fairly bright
  which in turn give the story a comical appeal. The story itself
  doesn't have any significant moral element to it...it is just a
  fun book. The rhyming in this story is very catching and the
  pictures really make the story very humorous. By the end of the
  story the reader can see that the big explosion has just caused a
  big mess. Children will like the flow the story and parents will
  enjoy reading it aloud. A good holiday gift.</Text>

  <Text category="book">Anyone who reads this book would not be
  surprised at the runaway success of the &amp;amp;quot;Left
  Behind&amp;amp;quot; series, since it demonstrates that a
  preoccupation with Bible prophecy affects a much wider
  demographic than the fundamentalist subculture. Indeed, the
  impact of premillenial thought has extended all the way up to the
  Reagan White House. And, Christian or not, who hasn't heard of
  the term &amp;amp;quot;Antichrist&amp;amp;quot; or the
  significance of the number &amp;amp;quot;666&amp;amp;quot;? This

  eschatology, including the role of Israel, Russia, the Arab
  countries, Europe, and the United States. It also shows how those
  beliefs have changed over the years (Turkey was considered Gog
  and Magog before Russia was, and the Pope was designated as the
  Antichrist for years before Hitler and Henry Kissinger came
  along). The final chapter, written at the brink of the collapse
  of the Soviet Union, demonstrates how, once again, premillenial
  thought adjusts itself (or sometimes not) depending upon world
  conditions. This is a fair, even-handed treatment of a religious

  that make both these books so special. I loved the first so much,
  I had to have this one the moment it appeared and it has only
  served to add to my list of pending projects</Text>
  <Text category="book">This book is a five star book!!!! I love it
  so much!!! Partly becuase I like mystery/adventurous books and I
  would recommend this to all of the people who like
  mystery/adventure. It is a GREAT book about a GREAT family when
  everything goes wrong when Janie Jonhson decides she wants to
  drink milk and when she looks at the back for the kidnapped kid -
  she learns too much..</Text>

  <Text category="book">I am fortunate enough to have met Ms.
  Elaine Stone herself and find her style to be that of great
  elegance, sophistication, grace, and poshness. She is by far the

  <Text category="book">Started out a bit slow and built into a
  real action packed thriller. Several times I found myself saying,
  "Oh Yuk!" Nevertheless the story line was fabulously interesting
  and you'll fall in love especially with Thomas, a down syndrome
  young man with a special gift. This is another great story by
  Koontz.</Text>
  <Text category="book">I enjoyed this book having read other
  non-fiction frontier books. However, I must say that the degree
  to which the author delves into how to make certain
  tools/objects, etc., I could have done without. I would skip
  through parts like those describing how to build a bean cooker,
  because such descriptions were so detailed. If you're a
  technical/hands-on person, then you probably would like knowing
  how items/tools were built from raw materials in the frontier.
  But for me, I was more interested in the story, than the
  instructionals.</Text>

  memo: "Bing Crosby's drying out at a Catholic Church retreat for
  alcoholic priests and nuns outside 29 Palms. Cardinal Spellman
  visited him there. They went on a bender and drove to L.A.

  of them to the hospital. Bing bought them off with autographed

  <Text category="book">"The Player" provided a trip back in time
  to what it was like playing ball around the turn of the century
  through the times of the first World War. To understand what
  Mathewson meant to the game itself is truly amazing. Not only
  being a phonomenal pitcher with exceptional control, he realized
  that he was a role model for others, not only the young kids that
  idolized him, but the everyday american worker. To know what he
  gave of himself to others off the ball field, his charity work,
  volunteering for WWI at the age of 37, gives us a better insight
  to the individual. The book also tells of his attempts to clean
  up the game, before the Black Sox scandal. He knew it was going
  on, tried to warn others, but no one would listen. A great read
  if you want to get a much clearer insight into one of the
  greatest ball players of all time. One that is unfortunatelly
  forgotten by too many in today's game</Text>
  <Text category="book">This book contains the childhood memoirs of
  Peter Reich. As the son of psychoanalyst Wilhelm Reich, Peter led
  a bizarre life. He lived with his parents on the family estate of
  Orgonon in the backwoods of Maine. Not only did his father
  develop a unique form of psychotherapy, but he also was a
  theorist who experimented with unknown forms of energy. As
  Wilhelm's only child, Peter was one of the first recipients of
  Reich's therapy methods, which involved special forms of touch,
  energy channeling, "softening the stomach", and inducing vomiting
  (in Peter's account). Peter was also made lieutenant in his
  father's defensive squad that protected the earth from UFO
  attacks through the use of "accumulator guns". The elder Reich
  eventually got in trouble with the FDA for manufacturing and
  promoting medical equipment without proper testing for safety and
  effectiveness. The court case involving his work eventually
  landed him in jail through contempt of court. Not long after
  being sent to prison, he passed away, apparently of heart
  failure. Upon his father's death, Peter found himself at the
  tender age of 13 forced to confront his father's legacy of
  brilliance and madness. Up until the time of his father's death,
  he had believed everything his father told him, not knowing
  enough of contemporary scientific theories to understand how
  different his father's version of reality was from most other
  people's, nor having established an identity of his own through
  which he could objectively choose between his father's
  explanations and standard scientific approaches. In this book,
  Peter tries to sort out for himself what is real and what is not,
  what is his, and what is his father's. The book reads like the
  proverbial onion-chapters move in a dreamlike fashion from one
  period of time to another. Sometimes it's hard to tell if what
  Peter is describing actually took place, or whether it was all an
  imaginative game in his head. By the end of the book, the reader
  will have some inkling of the confusion in Peter's mind, but,
  like Peter, may not be capable of saying what really happened. In
  any case, this is very much a book about Peter Reich, and not
  Wilhelm Reich, although readers who want to learn more about
  Wilhelm Reich may find some clues to his ideas through the
  interpretation of his son, who experienced them first hand and
  without question</Text>
  <Text category="book">This book is a must for anyone who works
  with older adults. It is a photographic essay of some very
  special people....people who embrace the robustness of life, and
  who are disciplined to maintain their capabilities as long as
  possible. Our world is steeped in ageism, that is, believing that
  older people are only capable of doing things that are
  &amp;amp;quot;appropriate&amp;amp;quot; for their age. This book
  shatters those beliefs and provides living examples of people who
  continue doing what they love to do physically. I wish that Etta
  Clark would revise this book with a new set of photos every year!
  I have seen some of these photos over and over again in lectures
  that people give about aging. It is a book to be owned, not
  borrowed</Text>
  <Text category="book">This book is a celebration of color and the
  watercolor medium. Turning the pages is like watching a fabulous
  fireworks display. Each page reveals another explosion of
  beautiful color painting. Like fireworks, some paintings go off
  with a huge bang, and others are more muted; but each painting
  has something to say -- there are no
  &amp;amp;quot;duds.&amp;amp;quot; Helpful comments by the artists
  give insight as to how and why each painting was done. If you're
  an artist looking for inspiration, this book can really give you
  a whack in the side of the head that will send you running to
  your paints. Even if you're not an artist, you'll enjoy the
  gorgeous colors and wide, wild variety of subjects and
  techniques. An astonishing book and well worth the price</Text>
  <Text category="book">From what I gather, Edward Abbey has
  somewhat of a cult following. I had never read anything by the
  guy, never even heard of him before I got this book. I just
  thought I should point that out before going on. This book kept
  me reading, no doubt about that. It has it's downsides, but
  overall, I'd reccomend it. Not "Hey, you gotta read this right
  now," but it's good if you're looking for something a little
  different. This book kind of made me think. I'm not the kind of
  guy who is always reading into a book trying to analyze every
  aspect of it. But I couldn't help it with this story. I thought a
  lot of it was psychological, dealing with the main character, his
  thoughts, attitudes, and what made him tick. This is a fairly
  long book, but the actual story of the guy going back to his
  hometown is short. The plot alternates every chapter-- one about
  where he presently is, and then a memory, then where he is, then
  another memory, and so on. Although it was an interesting way to
  write the book, I thought some of the memory sequences dragged a
  bit. But don't get me wrong, overall I did enjoy them. If you're
  looking for something that might be able to fuel a couple of
  thoughts about life, this is a good bookt to pick up</Text>
  <Text category="book">Angela Davis stands in my perspective as
  one of the most accomplished women of the postmodern era. This
  autobiography draws from her childhood to her young adulthood.
  Her account of prison life offers an unsentimental analysis of
  the sexual habits of women in prison. One factor that prevents me
  from giving this memoir a 5-star is her abandonment of her
  personal life as a woman. She focuses entirely on the black power
  movement. In closing, this memoir can offer women the strength to
  fight injustice but encouraging them to first empower
  themselves</Text>
  <Text category="book">The story is about Peter growing up with
  his family in North Dublin and is set in the 1960's. The tightly
  knit family relations with his own family and those of his
  extended family of lodgers, which his parents took in to
  supplement his father's income, forms the backdrop to his story
  at 44 Seville Place. The pace of the book has the rhythm of the
  sixties. The short sentences beat out the rhythm of the sixties
  and keeps the tempo up-beat throughout the whole of the book. For
  those who have experienced Dublin in the sixties this book will
  take you back to that place and that time. The metaphorical
  pieces were very touching and masterfully executed. One example
  of this technique was when Peter tries to get to grips with his
  emotions concerning the possible loss of his brother Frankie
  before Frankie goes into surgery. A joy to read. Da is the Sun
  and all the minor planets revolve around him. Peter takes to his
  role as Mercury the messenger with great relish. There is a
  strong bond between father and son. I feel this story should not
  be compared to Frank McCourt's Angela's Ashes. A one generation
  step into the future in Ireland can make a very big difference in
  how life is experienced. It was a very enjoyable read whereby the
  need to laugh out loud in places could not be silenced. However
  there were places in the book where the need to cry out loud
  could also not be silenced.</Text>
  <Text category="book">I enjoyed this book for the most part. I
  feel the trip throught the Stargate could have been better
  developed but it was enjoyable to see an inside view of the
  workings of the &amp;amp;quot;mountain&amp;amp;quot;. The main
  characters were all there, participating in the problem solving.
  There was a writers view of the teamwork seen in each episode,
  and some food for thought added in as well. Is the world really
  ready for the idea that we are part of a bigger universe out
  there? I don't know but this book presents some interesting
  questions. I await the next book in the series</Text>

  Spectacular Sex Guide inspires us into our sexual potential
  giving us the tools for sexual transformation. Even if we already
  have a satisfying sex life there are many interesting exercises
  here to try. I can relate to Annie's libraries of sexual
  experience even though I have not taken as many adventures as
  her. Really folks if some of us turned off our TVs and used that
  time to further our sexual awareness there would be a great
  possibility for personal sexual freedom. My favorite quote would
  be "Don't worry; be horny." Now that this wonderful book has been

  <Text category="book">This book is very revealing to the reader
  of the special aspect of being a Christian, which is being a
  dispenser as well as a receiver of grace. So much of the
  Christianity portrayed today is the exact opposite. We see more
  often the Christian faith portrayed as a religious form,
  political arm, and unloving attitude. This book is a real insight
  into the Christian faith of how to be a true follower of Christ
  who cared so much about individuals, especially those who were
  not self righteous, but fallen and in need of grace to restore
  their lives.</Text>
  <Text category="book">. . .maybe believe your suspenders, I'm not
  sure which. It seems to me that to enjoy this book, you have to
  suspend your suspicion of bombast and improbability. You also
  have to give up any qualms you might have about a protagonist
  who's pretty much a pedophile and whose connection to planet
  earth seems pretty improbable. What you get in return are some
  amazing language, some great observations and a character whose
  zenny zest is intense but not cartoonish. Much too cerebral to
  ever be made into a movie by any director alive now, this is a
  book to be enjoyed as a pure artifact of whacked-out, but
  craftsman-like writing</Text>
  <Text category="book">For those who endeavor to perfect fine art

  application and intereaction of all of these variables. The book

  <Text category="book">I felt that the book was basically the same
  as the previous edition, with the exception of aromatherapy, and
  electric filing. Unfortionatly no one book can give all of the
  information that is required about a subject. That is what
  teaching is all about. I generally supplement the material from
  other books, and Florida law so our students stay on the right
  path. Over all I would have to say that this book was above
  average, and addressed many of the changes in the industry to

  <Text category="book">I loved this book. It talked about every
  facet of the stock market, but didn't go overboard with jargon. I
  knew absolutely nothing about stocks and after reading this book
  I am ready to learn more. It was well written, interesting, and,
  unlike some investing books, the author was not trying to sell
  anything. This is the perfect book for anyone who wants to invest
  but has no knowledge of the subject. I really enjoyed this

  <Text category="book">For a recently college graduate and
  moderate sports world observer with little experience negotiating
  in a business environment, this book was a pleasure to read. The
  concepts in this book are on or above par with my textbook on
  negotiation. However, I specifically enjoyed how Steinberg
  illustrates important concepts with stories involving the ever
  interesting personalities of professional sports. From
  establishing values to finalizing the contract, this book is
  efficiently organized to lead through the negotiation process.
  Also, at the end of each sub-chapter is a summary of the key
  points of the reading. Winning with integrity isn't easy in
  general, let alone in the ruthless world of sports agents. Leigh
  shares his experiences that have lead to his success in this fun
  and insightful book</Text>
  <Text category="book">This classic chronicle of Presidential
  campaigns, from the get-go to contemporary times, has the unusual
  virtue of being useful either as a collection of short readable
  chapters - each just the right size for a daily bus or train ride
  - or as a reference source. Reading this in the wake of
  Monicagate and the Florida Recount, it's instructive to read the
  history of Grover Cleveland, who seems to have features of BOTH
  past Democratic candidates. Like Clinton, he had his scandals -
  fathering an illegitimate child. Like Gore, his career was rudely
  interrupted by an election which he won on popular votes but
  lost, in a hotly contested, knife-edge electoral college
  tally</Text>
  <Text category="book">Goes over the problem in detail, but
  without excessive hand-wringing. A diversity of well selected

  definitely get this book</Text>
  <Text category="book">The Book arrived in a timely fashion. The
  photograply was beautiful. However, I found it to be a
  coffee-table book rather than a text book which I needed</Text>
  <Text category="book">I was assigned this book for a college
  course and was greatly surprised at its quality. Blamires had
  C.S. Lewis as a tutor, and I've read some of Lewis's writings and
  have found them to be above average but not particularly special
  (many people do find his works special of course). Blamires, on
  the other hand, I find to be very unique - his book is top
  quality and very helpful. I'm surprised this isn't a very popular
  book, as it ought to be. I have only two complaints, both of
  which are purely stylistic. First, the edition I have looks like
  it's a copy of an earlier edition, which makes the text hard to
  read (I got used to it after a while though). Some publisher
  should take it upon themself to retype this book and republish
  it. My second criticism is something that can't be avoided - the
  book was originally written in the early sixties, so a lot of the
  examples are dated (i.e. references to WWII, which was still in
  memory, also out-of-date terms like "jive", etc.). However, just
  a few of the examples are affected by this. The book as a whole
  could be reasonably passed off today as a recent work, since so
  much Blamires's criticism of the Christian mind (or lack thereof)
  still (sadly) applies. However, the Christian mind today is being
  rediscovered, and the march of atheism is on the decline, with
  the march of religion in general on the rise. Even though things
  are looking up, Christians should keep Blamires's book in mind -
  not to get too comfortable with this (secular) world, for our
  real home is beyond bodily death. That we ought to have a
  supernatural orientation is basically the theme and summary of
  this book. Superb book, and I really recommend this to anyone.
  This is definitely recommended for Christians, and also for any
  non-Christian who are curious and want to take a look at some of
  the problems Christians have today</Text>
  <Text category="book">Let me just say from the start i worship at
  the alter of Richard Meier, I absolutely, love his work. It's so
  clean and light and refreshing. This book does a commendable job
  of showing some of Mr. Meiers most recent work, i especially like
  the section on his apartment towers in Manhattan, these small
  towers are as gorgeous as they are contriversial, and the
  building got a great write up in Vanity Fair a few years ago,
  well worth the read, anyway the text in this book is well
  researched and the images are first rate, let's just say that if
  you have any interest in Richard Meier or just great modern
  architecture then i believe you will not be disappointed in this
  purchase. Highly recommended</Text>
  <Text category="book">There are many gorgeous photos of both the
  insides and outsides of public and personal spaces. I was
  actually surprised at the number of homes we get a peek into. If
  you enjoy interior design, of just about any style, you will find
  it here. I love all the personal libraries shown, crammed with
  books and interesting objects. Loved the mannequins, esp the
  life-sized guy sitting on the couch. I am a fan of exotic,
  eclectic decorating and found many examples to keep me happy with
  the book</Text>
  <Text category="book">I absolutely think you should have this
  book as part of your collection. The pictures come to life along
  with the description. The wording is simple and sweet. I am a
  first grade teacher and taught using this book. All my students
  enjoyed the memory this book brings to life. Vivid pictures and
  colors are an absolute gift from the artist</Text>
  <Text category="book">The Emotionally Unavailable Man should be
  added to everyone's self-help library. Ms. Henry clearly
  identifies and defines the problem, then prescribles manageable

  emotional detachment will find this book engaging. Most may even
  identify loved ones who either exhibit this or who are involved
  with someone who exhibits this behavior. Clearly this is a book
  for our times.</Text>

  with Crow bringing a homeless teenager home for dinner and a
  place to stay for the night. It turns out that the teenager,
  Lloyd, was a witness to a crime, and that draws Tess into the

  her life as the case develops and federal agents demand that she
  reveal the name of the source. The story starts with a narration
  by Crow, and alternates between Crow, Tess, and other characters
  in the story. You will get a lot more Crow in this novel than in
  others. The story has an interesting ending, and you can wonder
  if Lloyd will show up again. You get some information along the
  way about Baltimore soup kitchens and the homeless, and a view of
  the underside of society where life is sometimes cheap</Text>

  <Text category="book">More than anything else Alan Furst
  recreates the atmosphere of the early days of World War II
  espionage. I.A. Serebin inhabits the urbane world of Russian
  emigres in the Europe of 1940-1941, mainly in Paris, but also in
  Roumania. Serebin is recruited into what seems to be the British
  secret service and seeks to interrupt the flow of Roumanian oil
  to the Nazi war machine. The whole operation reeks of amateurism
  - appropriate enough at that stage of the war - brainy, careful,
  daring, but amateur. With one exception, none of the players know
  completely what they are part of - which also leaves the reader
  at times groping for the story line. Still Furst's prose forms
  the characters into full-dimensional beings from Bogart's
  Casablanca or Graham Greene's Human Factor. Highly recommended
  for readers with an interest in espionage or WW II</Text>
  <Text category="book">I ordered this book primarily for the
  benefit of my 7 year old son. We're doing a research project on
  oceans, and while we have a few good resources, I felt this one,
  with its 3d imagery, would more likely capture and hold his
  attention. What I didn't realize was how thoroughly it would
  capture and hold mine. For me, 3D had always meant multicolored
  plastic glasses and headaches. Though the book was described as
  stereoscopic, I didn't understand what that meant. Stereography
  was something new for me, even if as a form of photography it is
  over 150 years old. This is not a matter of red and blue
  separations; the 3D results from the human eye's trick of
  blending 2 photos taken (simultaneously) an eye's width apart.
  Photographer Mark Blum is a pioneer in the art of underwater 3d
  photography, and his work is beautifully displayed here. Everyone
  I've shown this book to has been fascinated by it, and I fully
  expect that when we've finished with our project the book will
  find its way to permanent display in my home</Text>
  <Text category="book">This book opens our eyes. Sure, we feel
  that we know what we should be doing. Many times we are right in
  our hunches. Yet, we still do not always do what needs to be
  done. Instead, out of either laziness or taking the easy road, we
  fail because it is so easy to do so. Besides, the customer will
  always walk in the door. Right? As this book reminds us, the
  customer may never be back. It is in the insight of a
  professioanl like Tasca that we are reminded of wehat we may
  already know. Again, our implementation of these rules which he
  explains simply, we will achieve. Another book I encourage is

  <Text category="book">Set in a German village reminiscent of
  Grimm's fairy tale world this book will quickly have readers
  under it's spell. This tale within a tale within a tale concerns
  a young clockmaker,Karl, who needs to create a figure for the
  great clock of Glockenheim to mark the end of his apprenticeship.
  Time is running out for Karl and he is fretful because has not
  yet made the figure. At this same time Fritz, a young storyteller
  is telling his latest spooky tale to the villagers. Fritz
  launches in to a very mysterious tale of a prince, who it is
  disovered at his "death" is actually kept alive by clockworks
  rather than by a heart. Also in Fritz's story is a stange man
  named Dr. Kalmanius. When this highly unusual man is described by
  the storyteller an identical man suddenly appears. The stunned
  audience quickly leaves. As the others leave this strange man
  approaches Karl and presents him with the needed clock figure
  "springing" Fritz's tale alarmingly to life. As always Philip
  Pullman creates a vibrant and engaging cast of characters who
  will leave an imprint on the reader's memory. The illustrations
  by Leonid Gore capture both the fairy tale spirit and the horror
  under the surface. This is a quick but original and engaging read
  that will appeal to both horror and fairy tale fans. Don't miss

  <Text category="book">This book reveiw is on a book named Last
  Summer with Maizon. This book is about two best friends named
  Margarate and Maizon who lives on Madison Street. Her friend
  Maizon was accepted to Blue Hills, a school where really educated
  people go. Margarate does not want them to be separated. Every
  night she wishes Maizon will not get accepted. But when
  Margarate's father has a second heart attack, he dies and now all
  Margarate has is Maizon, her mother, her little brother Jay and
  the people around. Margarete was having a rough time anyway and
  then Maizon got accepted to Blue Hills. When it was time for
  Maizon to leave Margarate, her mother and Maizon's grandmother
  dropped her off. When Maizon wasn't there with Margarate her
  whole life changed. At school she was becoming popular, she was
  liked now. Days passed by and Maizon still didn't call. When
  Margarate went to go get her brother at her neighbors house,
  that's when Maizon calls. Margarate was so excited that Maizon
  wanted to come home. Margarate ran to the grandmother's house
  telling her the news. Margarate said Maizon wants to come home,
  the grandmother says that she would go get her. When Maizon got
  home it was like old times, they ran into each others arms. They
  then went to their favorite spot and started talking. Maizon said
  she came back because she wasn't being treated right, she didn't
  feel the same. So they sat there and talked and felt like old
  times with my best friend Maizon. I think that this book should
  have gotten an award or five stars. This book has mostly
  everything of real life. It deals with best friends, for example
  like my friendship with Kiena. It has separation, like my sister
  and me. It has a lost loved one like my godfather and it has a
  lesson like when you do wrong and learn your lesson. I think that
  this book should have five stars because it really relates to
  real life,it shows friendship and it shows and explains what
  happens in real life. I like this book because it reminds me of
  my life, me and my friends, how we argue and lose our friendship
  and then gain it back with a little talking. It reminds me of how
  I lose people in my family and then cry because I miss them. If I
  could buy this book, I would let my whole family read it, I would
  make it our reference book for when we need advice or something
  to do. This book is so good that all my friends wanted to read
  it. It is so good that I really read it because I don't really
  read books and when I read the book it made me think of when my
  best friend Ariel was going to move and how it made me feel, and
  how I compare it to Margarate and Maizon. This book is excellent,
  the author really put their heart in it and that they were
  depressed and needed a friend. If you ask my best friend
  Johnniece, she'll say that she really enjoyed the book, that it
  should get five stars, because the author really put thought,
  confidence, respect, love, care and her whole heart into this
  book. When I say she put confidence in this book I meant that she
  wrote it knowning that it will be a hit. The author thought about
  the words, thought her life and compared it and started writing
  it with compassion. I think that this book should be the book of
  the month in my school, because it shows and teaches a lesson.
  With the summary I wrote I put my heart in it because when I read
  it, it touched my heart. I won't want my friend away from me. I
  think that I mostly relate to Maizon, because when she left
  Margarte was beginning to be liked, and the girl was talking
  about Maizon and Margarte sat there and watched and listened
  instead of doing the right thing and telling them to stop doing
  that to their friend. I relate to Maizon, I relate to her because
  if people don't like me, I don't care. If people want me out of
  somewhere, then I'll leave and if people love me, I love them
  back and that's how Maizon is. She doesn't take junk. Alot of
  people relate to Maizon. This book is interesting and gets
  interesting as you read on. This book is really a good book that
  shows you friendship, break-up and everything else that deals
  with real life. I love this book, it is really good and I think
  that if most people had this book then they wouldn't be out doing
  the stupid and illegal things that they are doing. This book
  really didn't grasp Dr. Kings dream because when Maizon went to
  Blue Hills, the whites were treating her bad, they saw her
  different. Brenliniqua, Class 7-512</Text>
  <Text category="book">The Snow Goose is a beautifully written
  book that lingers in the memory long after the hour or so that it
  takes to read. Set on the coast of England at the time of
  Dunkirk, it is less about the strife of WWII itself than about
  its three main characters - one of whom is the snow goose - and
  what binds them. It is a story about nature, love, and nobility
  of spirit. To say more would be to give too much away. But it has
  had a place on my bookshelf for decades, and I reread it when I
  need to be reminded what is important in life</Text>

  <Text category="book">My boy EJD is back, and so am I! Keeping it
  real, I took an Eric Jerome Dickey hiatus. For years he held a
  special spot on my shelf as my favorite author, hands down. Then
  it happened...his books just weren't doing it for me anymore.
  Call in change, call it growth, falling off, call it whatever,
  but I wasn't feeling it. DRIVE ME CRAZY drove me crazy and I
  couldn't finish it. Unheard of for me. CHASING DESTINY came, but
  I let her run right past me. However, the title of his new
  release piqued my interest, so I decided to give it a shot and I
  am glad I did. Death is life. Gideon is a freelance hit man. In
  the seedy underbelly of death for hire, Gideon is know as a man
  of talent and business; a profitable business. He has a goal that
  he is trying to reach and with this acceptance of his most recent
  job, he just may obtain it. This job could put him over the edge
  financially and literally. Has the hunter become the hunted?
  Sleeping With Strangers is a smartly written, great reading
  drama/thriller that showcases Dickey's talent. He blended
  success, style and heartlessness. Then he added some
  ruthlessness, deceit and trickery. Let's not forget murder,
  mayhem and steamy sex scenes. My hiatus is officially over. I
  enjoyed SWS. Now I`m at the door, looking out the peephole
  waiting on the sequel to arrive</Text>
  <Text category="book">In Self-Hypnosis for Women C. Alexander and
  Annellen Simpkins have created an instrument, a book and CD
  combination tailored to both the novice and the familiar
  practitioner of hypnosis. The Simpkins have masterfully crafted
  this guide to self-guidance weaving explanation and experience
  throughout the written and spoken words. Provided are tools
  useful in addressing a wide array of events familiar to most on
  the journey of being human. While true to its title,
  Self-Hypnosis for Women, offering examples of utilization
  directly fashioned to "experiences" idiosyncratic to women:
  menstruation, pregnancy, labor and delivery, and menopause, the
  title of this work belies its more universal "applicability" to
  components of life common to both women and men: self image; pain
  management; overcoming fear and anxiety, and finding personal
  balance. The book is prefaced with instructions on gaining the
  most benefit for individual readers. Those who may wish to skip
  over the more basic instructions are advised to begin their
  journey in later chapters. Those who are new to the practice of
  hypnosis, or enjoy viewing the history and techniques from
  others' perspectives are offered just that in the earlier
  chapters. The story of hypnosis, and the modern history and
  research of hypnosis take the readers back to the early stages of
  identified systematic trancework, from Mesmer, Charcot and Freud,
  to the contributions of Hilgard, Hull, and Milton H. Erickson;
  they then procede to accompany the participant on the journey
  through current and future directions, including their own paths,
  on which they are about to embark. The Simpkins define suggestion
  as "a process by which a stimulus is accepted and then
  transformed through unconscious processing into an action,
  experience, attitude or concept. (p.45)" This presentation of
  suggestion sets the stage for an environment conducive to the
  development of a personal ability to self-guide. Together, the
  book and CD promote the utilization of both conscious and
  unconscious processes as learning tools, assisting in the
  transformation from less popular emotions such as fear or sadness
  to components of life which offers guidance and assistance.
  Specific hypnotic techniques, are explained, and accompanied by
  exercises which give the audience an immediate opportunity to
  begin experiencing and tailoring that procedure. The framework
  for these exercises is the suggestion of an "experiment" with
  that particular technique, creating an environment for the
  learner to safely attempt each new activity with no possibility
  of failure. The only opportunity not offered is that of
  incompetence. There is only a place to try, adjust, and retry
  each experiment until the reader fashions their own skill set
  based on personal significance and comfort. More than a "bonus"
  the accompanying CD is a work of art on its own. Again, mixing
  explanation with experiential learning, this auditory tool
  incorporates fractalization as a teaching method, to assist the
  listener in entering and returning from graduated levels of
  trance exploration. A vast canvas is provided, upon which the
  hypnotic partner can create motor, auditory and visual
  experiences with encouragement and assistance, rather than
  direction or interference, a respectful approach not always found
  in "self-hypnosis" recordings. Sharon McLaughlin MA, Managing
  Editor, Milton H. Erickson Newsletter</Text>
  <Text category="book">Whenever my eczema flared up, my friends
  would tell me I'm too stressed out. I didn't feel that way, not
  much more stressed out than usual, so the timing of the flare ups
  and the stress level at that time was sometimes confusing. After
  reading this book, however, I recognized it's much more than just
  the simple stress - more deeply rooted issues I've apparently
  held for a long time. I had vaguely suspected this may be the
  case, but didn't know how/where to start. This book gave me the
  guidance to do that on my own. I agree with 3 other reviewers
  completely. I no longer feel helpless and scared when I can feel
  my skin starting to flare up. I am not yet free from eczema, but
  knowing what may be the underlying cause of it, and how to calm
  it down, I have much stronger sense of being in control of my
  skin, body and my life</Text>

  that after a long day, mama will come home to the sweet bedtime

  <Text category="book">I found the first book, Faerie Wars, pretty
  interesting so I decided to read this one. In many ways it had
  excellent qualities such as suspense, mystery and a bit of
  romance. I'll have to admit, I finished the book pretty quickly
  because I got hooked onto it and didn't want to put it down.
  There were many twists and turns of the plot, and it was
  practically impossible to guess what would happen next at times.
  I did, however, find the ending a tad abrupt. It was such a shame
  to finish the book without any more information on Pyrgus, Mr.
  Fogarty, Henry or Blue. But overall the book was an excellent
  one..... it will certainly capture your interest</Text>

  <Text category="book">I am a huge Thomas Hardy fan, and I was not
  disappointed with this book. At first all the technical
  astronomical information was slow, but the love story started and
  that was forgotten. My only complaint about Two on a Tower is the
  ending. It seems very rushed - everything comes crashing together
  in about 10 pages. It wasn't realistic for Viviette to age so
  much and no longer be beautiful 4 years later, considering she
  was only 33 at the end of the story. Sir Constantine was
  possessive, jealous and terrifying but she still kept her health
  and beauty after suffering with him. The bishop was full of
  himself - how is that worse? A few years with him and all of a
  sudden she's an old woman with a heart condition? Swithin comes
  back and says he'll marry her, she's overcome with joy and BOOM!
  She dies in his arms. I also find it strange that neither Swithin
  or Viviette acknowledged that the boy was his. Didn't people in
  the village realize who he looked like, since people were already
  suspicious of the lovers? What will happen next, Swithin takes
  his son in and marries Tabitha Lark? A very good, sad,
  complicated romance</Text>
  <Text category="book">The author gave many thorough and
  enlightening illustrations on how communication breaks down
  &amp;amp;amp; what to look out for. After reading &amp;amp;amp;
  self-examination, one could identify the areas for improvement
  &amp;amp;amp; learn from the methods prescribed. The first part
  identifies the types of relationships within the family. The
  second on developing God-honouring relationships, dwelling mainly
  on the subject of communication. I was very much enlightened by
  the types of circuit jammers within the family. Part three
  expounds on sustaining Godly family relationships. It explains
  why families fight &amp;amp;amp; how to turn discord to concord.
  I am very much encouraged &amp;amp;amp; edified from the reading
  of this book</Text>
  <Text category="book">I didn't expect to "like" this book after
  reading the first 30 of 196 pages. The graphic detail used to
  describe a murder and the early decomposition of two dead bodies
  made me wonder where in the heck this story could go. And, more
  importantly, why would I want to read it! Where does the story
  go? It's a wandering timetable. We know the two main characters,
  Joseph and Celice, both professors of zoology married for 30
  years, are dead and the forward movement not only includes their
  ongoing decay, but also their eventual discovery by police dogs
  and the introduction of their grown daughter, Syl, as she copes
  with her knowledge of their death. It also goes back to when they
  first met, as students sharing a study house at the shore. They
  are an unlikely pair, and yet, they come together through mutual
  attraction and what turns out to be a shared tragic experience,
  and live--at least according to their estranged daughter--an
  unremarkable life. The timetable further allows the reader to
  relive the last day of their lives, hour by hour, from the murder
  back to the moment they awoke and decided to spend the day
  together at the very shore where they'd met some 30 years
  earlier. The layout of the story was brilliant, and not in the
  least bit confusing. The language (British English) is both lofty
  and gritty--probably not unlike Joseph and Celice. Some of the
  thoughtful insights about life and death are very, very poignant.
  For example, when Syl contemplates the loss of her parents: "...
  Her gene supplies had closed shop. Their daughter was the next in
  line. She could not duck out of the queue. So she should not
  waste her time in this black universe. The world's small,
  breathing denizens, its quaking congregations and its stargazers,
  were fools to sacrifice the flaring briefness of their lives in
  hopes of paradise or fears of hell. No one transcends. There is
  no future and no past. There is no remedy for death--or
  birth--except to hug the spaces in between. Live loud. Live wide.
  Live tall." I thought it was a very elegant way of illustrating
  both the fact that life always goes marching on, and the
  importance of our obligation to the dead (and dying) that we live
  life well. The title and thesis of the book are one and the same:
  "Being Dead." Highly recommend. From the author of "A Line
  Between Friends," McKenna Publishing Group</Text>
  <Text category="book">Black Metropolis is perhaps the founding
  document of African-American studies, a classic work of sociology
  that still resonates today. It is a paradigmatic expression of
  the Chicago School of sociology, however, a school that today
  stands in some disrepute, at least in some circles. Indirectly,
  it was the target of James Baldwin's famous attack on Richard
  Wright in his essay, Everybody's Protest Novel. The claim of the
  criticism has been that the Chicago School, due to its insistance
  upon using a &amp;amp;quot;scientific approach&amp;amp;quot;,
  merely reproduces the very terms under which African-Americans
  have been oppressed--a claim that has proceeded under the warrant
  of European intellectuals such as Theodor Adorno. Still, Black
  Metropolis is a landmark study, and, unfortunately, many if not
  most of its observations and conclusions remain true today, and
  in fact it could be argued that conditions in the Black Belt of
  Chicago have gotten worse, not better, since 1945, the year of
  Black Metropolis' publication--which lends a certain credence to
  the criticisms mentioned above, though perhaps it should be
  qualified by saying that they are not so much criticisms of the
  Chicago School as they are criticisms of American society. Since
  then, as we know, we have witnessed a great shift in American
  public opinion away from what some consider to be the excesses of
  those days; so much so, in fact, that the work of Black
  Metropolis may again be regarded as a profoundly useful book.
  Embodying American liberalism as it does--which counted as a
  grave sin thirty years ago--Black Metropolis may possibly be due
  for a fresh look</Text>

  <Text category="book">If you like fantasy and are not acquainted
  with the works of Andre Norton, then this is an excellent
  starting point. Believable, heroic characters and a well
  thought-out &amp;amp;quot;Witch World&amp;amp;quot; combine to
  make for an enjoyable read. Simon Tregarth is transported through
  a mysterious gate into a world populated by people and other
  things not people. A struggle goes on between good and evil, and
  it's not clear who is winning. (But, we know who wins in the end
  - &amp;amp;quot;good&amp;amp;quot;, of course.) The style of
  writing - more of a story that unfolds as it is read - is one
  strength that characterizes her writings. That, and the
  fascinating settings, imaginative perils faced, and strong
  likable characters make this a &amp;amp;quot;must
  read&amp;amp;quot;. This is a refreshing hard-to-put-down story.
  It does not suffer from the typical overinflated, overwordy,
  overcomplicated, and overcharacterized (and lifeless) features of
  the usual fantasy megathon offered today</Text>
  <Text category="book">We have now entered a second time of deep
  concern for the science, math, and technological education for
  everyone. The first one occurred after the Sputnik fiasco, when
  the Russians beat us in the race to reach space. The concern now
  has risen due to what science groups such as the American
  Association for the Advancement of Science, and educators saw in
  comparison of assessments made of students in the U.S. and those
  in other developed countries, such as Japan. The answer to this
  concern was for the AAAS along with other groups to put out a
  guideline as to what constitutes scientific literacy, and what
  the public in the U.S. should at least know to be scientifically
  literate. As usual, though the AAAS addressed the fact that
  certain groups in the U.S. were not being 'included' in the
  pursuit of science literacy, such as women and racial minorities,
  in this their first book they skipped over those of us with
  disabilities. Since this is a major concern of mine and the area
  in which I do research, I was appalled to see they neglected 'us'
  once again, especially as the AAAS has a separate department
  dealing with the Disabled/Deaf. In spite of this mistake, the
  writing of this book has laid the groundwork for universities and
  colleges as to what the teachers they train should know and be
  able to teach so that our country can be more scientifically
  literate. With new information being made available through
  newspapers and the Internet on a daily basis, it is absolutely
  imperative that all adults regardless of race, gender, or ability
  be able to glean the information they need from this outpouring
  of information to make decisions requiring informed consent in
  health care, decisions on employment (since health care is one of
  the top employers in the U.S. today), and to teach their
  children. This book was the beginning, but it isn't the end. More
  books have further elucidated what is required for science
  literacy from both the AAAS and other science groups. This is the
  place to start if you are an educator of any kind who wants their
  students to become scientifically literate. Karen Sadler, Science
  Education, University of Pittsburgh, klsst23@pitt.ed</Text>
  <Text category="book">Mark L. Sirower's thought-provoking and
  complex book is actually a critically acclaimed academic study
  that challenges the reasoning behind corporate acquisitions.
  Pointing out that acquisitions usually devalue the acquiring
  companies (a loss from which they rarely recover), Sirower delves
  into management fundamentals and mathematical analyses to get to
  the bottom of merger and acquisition problems. Three detailed
  appendices feature plenty of financial calculations, performance
  measures and data from various corporate acquisitions to back up
  his assertions. We [...] recommend this book to those involved in
  mergers and acquisitions and to other readers intrigued by the
  inside view of this "carnivorous quest.</Text>
  <Text category="book">I had no prior experience with music
  playing (other than blowing some simple tunes from a harmonica)
  and, yet, I found this book to be surprisingly easy to learn
  from. It smoothly and concisely guides the reader through the key
  elements of piano playing, starting with one-hand playing, but
  quickly to two-hands, then chords, etc., and ending with sharp
  and flat notes. It is well organized, has well thought out
  exercises, advices, and a diverse collection of (short)
  attractive tunes of increasing complexity (from Jingle Bells to
  Waltzing Matilda to Silent Night to Green Sleeves to We Shall
  Overcome to Minuet in G Minor). I prefer it to other
  teach-yourself piano books that take much longer to cover the
  same skills, such as The Complete Piano Player or Piano for
  Dummies. I particularly like that it gets to two-hand playing
  almost right away, which I feel is better preparation--even if it
  feels hard and slows the playing initially. It may have helped
  (coordination-wise) that I have been typing for 20+ years with
  both hands. If you are looking for a book that teaches all the
  essentials of basic piano playing in a thoughtful and concise
  way, then I recommend this book. If you perfer a slower pace,
  then maybe look elsewhere. For me, this was the perfect book to
  learn from.</Text>

  <Text category="book">The story, Walk Across the Sea, by Susan
  Fletcher, takes place at a town near the ocean. White people
  thought themselves superior to others, especially the Chinese.
  Chinese were often looked down upon and shunned, mainly because
  of their religious beliefs. The lighthouse keeper's daughter,
  however, was different from other white people. Believing her
  father's talks about Chinese people in the beginning of the
  story, the girl, Eliza Jane, meets a Chinese boy around her age.
  After the Chinese boy saves her goat, Eliza becomes interested in
  the boy's behavior. Soon, she learns that everyone may not be as
  they seemed. This story was rather interesting in a way. The time
  of the story show how the characters act and think. The story
  also shows how different some characters are, such as Eliza's
  father and mother. ("Something moved inside me, like a sudden
  shift in the wind.") Eliza was also, in a way, different from
  other white people. She befriended and showed kindness toward the
  Chinese boy. ("`You'll do him no harm? I have your word on it?'")
  I was also amazed by the twist of the story when the story
  reveals that the father truly worries about the Chinese boy. Of
  all of the stories I have read, I have never found one that was
  perfect. This story is no different. When the Chinese people were
  driven out of the village by angry white people, I could feel the
  same shock and anger Eliza felt. The story, however, has a few
  more bad parts. One boy, Amos, accidentally broke Eliza Jane's
  nose while trying to find the Chinese boy. Afraid that he might
  get in trouble, the boy lied to his father about breaking Eliza's
  nose. To make matters worse, Amos blames the fault on the Chinese
  boy! ("I had a mind to shout at him, to tell him to put her
  down...") On the other hand, I did not like how Eliza acted
  toward the Chinese boy when they first met. When the boy yelled a
  warning, Eliza thought he was trying to scare her off so he could
  steal her goat. Therefore, when the boy was holding the goat,
  Eliza thought that he was taking the goat from her, when what
  really happened was that the boy saved the goat from a wave. Even
  so, that was not the worst part of the story. ("`Get you from
  me,' he said. `I can't be near you now. Get out of my sight!'")
  As a father, Eliza's father was expected by me to listen and talk
  to Eliza about her Chinese friend, and maybe even understand why
  she was protecting him. As a result, I was shocked and
  disappointed in her father when he told her that he did not even
  want to talk to her! Thankfully, there was nothing worse than
  this part of the story. ("Terrible things can happen in this
  world-things you can't explain away. It's not safe here, Andrew
  John. I can't promise you'll be safe. But there are miracles,
  too-like you. And love. And glories well beyond our knowing.")
  The ending, where Eliza talks to her baby brother about life and
  the Chinese boy was my favorite part. It ties everything together
  and concludes the story about friendship</Text>
  <Text category="book">In 1995 the poverty level for a family of
  four in the United States was $19,806. 37 million people in the
  US live at or below this level. Ron Sider correctly asserts that
  it is morally unacceptable for 37 million people to live in
  poverty in this country while the wealthiest people are gaining a
  larger percentage of all wealth. In Just Generosity, Sider
  presents his vision for overcoming poverty in America. And it is
  a compelling vision. Sider's vision is distinctive because he
  acknowledges that poverty is caused by both systemic injustice in
  society's structures and by poor moral decisions by impoverished
  individuals. Both must be addressed in order to stop cycles of
  poverty. Drawing upon biblical study, Sider presents the goal of
  an economy of justice: "Every person or family has access to
  productive resources (land, money, knowledge) so they have the
  opportunity to earn a generous sufficiency of material
  necessities and be dignified participating members of their
  community" (81). Sider deals with a vast array of programs and
  issues like welfare, minimum wage, tax credits, health care, and
  education reform, showing how each could be employed in ways that
  encourage work, empower the poor, and strengthen families. Sider
  ends with this troubling question: Do enough Christians really
  care? This book should be required reading for any that
  do.</Text>
  <Text category="book">Richard Fortney's "Earth" is a survey, in
  mostly layman's terms, of the geological history of the Earth and
  how it relates to humankind. Fortney tells the story by means of
  a journey around the earth, selecting a series of locations where
  the earth's geology is apparent, and usually the meaning of that
  geology was debated by scholars to a greater understanding.
  Fortney starts at Mount Vesuvius in Italy, preceeds to the
  Hawaiian Islands, hence to the Swiss Alps and to other locations
  aroudn the world. Fortney relates the geology of each chosen
  location to plate tectonics as a means to explain how each
  terrain come to be the way it is. This leads into extended and
  sometimes fascinating discussions of the former alignements of
  the continents in prior ages such as the "supercontinent" of
  Gondwana. For each location, Fortney also relates the effects of
  the terrain on the history of the humans who have lived in that
  location. Along the way, Fortney drives home the sheer vastness
  of the timescale of earth and its geological processes. The
  dedicated reader will view his landscape with a new perspective.
  Fortney is a gifted writer with a good eye for the illustrative
  anecdote. Large portions of this book will be fascinating to the
  reader with at least some schooling in the sciences. It turns
  out, for example, that the complicated geology of Newfoundland
  results from its origin as pieces of three different tectonic
  plates (North America, ocean bottom, and Northern Europe). The
  descriptions of Northwest Scotland as the remains of truly
  ancient mountains are put into appropriate scale in part by
  Fortney's historical anecdotes and by his experiences of
  rockhounding in the often cold rainy weather of the Scottish
  Highlands. The narrative runs a little long at over 400 pages,
  and Fortney's explanations will sometimes outrun the scientific
  background of the average reader. Nevertheless, this book is
  highly recommended to the reader with at least a casual interest
  in geology and its links to human history</Text>
  <Text category="book">This is an enlightening, meticulous story
  of William "Boss" Tweed and, as past of the context, his three
  key cronies in the ring: Peter Sweeny, Richard Connolly and
  Oakley Hall. It is a story about how the New York Times elevated
  itself by getting the goods on corruption and bravely exposing it
  on the front page. Oh how the mighty have fallen! The time of
  power (terror?) for Tweed's edition of Tammany Hall was
  relatively short, but Tammany Hall power lingered well after
  Tweed's demise, another eithy-five years. The critical moment to
  the story is when Tweed engineers the proverbial license to steal
  by devising a new charter for New York City, putting the power in
  the hands of his incredibly greedy ring of thieves. The four took
  this opportunity to carve out a fortune for themselves, primarily
  by paying millions of dollars for a courthouse that should have
  cost a few hundred thousand to build. A disgruntled
  'whistleblower' (the term had no meaning back then) copied over
  the records in enough detail to demonstrate the bold theft and
  fraud. There are several versions of how the blockbuster story of
  the padded expenses and outright theft came into the Times'
  hands, but the remarkable part of the story is just how brazen
  the "Ring" could be, how convinced they were of their own
  invincibility or ability to bribe, cheat and steal their way out
  of any legal investigation or hearings. People who today believe
  we live in an era of unbridled corporate greed and ethical lapses
  need to read this book to better understand how much the supposed
  watchdog and people's friend -- the government -- can be part of
  the problem and a barrier to the solution. The cast of
  characters, sinners, (few) saints, and masses of immigrants makes
  following the flow of the book sometimes a challenging task.
  Thomas Nast, a pivotal character if not the hero of the book,
  provides some vivid, visual signposts. Nast not only draws a
  compelling picture for often illiterate 'readers', he was one of
  the first to put a face on public figures who heretofore had not
  been subjected to portraits or paparazzi as are today's
  politicians. Nast's giving Tweed a face may have been one of the
  breakthrough aspects of this story. It certainly helped catch
  Tweed when he jumped bail. A few maps, perhaps some old drawings,
  and even a list of key characters could have perhaps clarified
  some of the story or reduced my thumbing back to previous pages
  or checking the index for the entry and bio of important members
  of the cast. There are some historic New York Times front page
  stories that help create atmosphere and context. Any reasonably
  educated American should have learned at least the sketchy
  details of Tweed's nefarious deeds and Nast's colorful cartoons.
  Ackerman does an excellent job of documenting and detailing,
  filling in the gaps, and bringing now faded, black-and-white
  characters back to life</Text>

  world of a bygone era, that of border radio. Brilliant
  technicians constructed gargantuan transmitters along the border
  towns of Texas/Mexico and beamed their signal into all of North

  on his radio. These stations were distinguished by their call

  wrote very well and his language is beautiful. From this fine

  fascinating look at a difficult topic! Many viewpoints are

  <Text category="book">Time to pack up my luggage (wouldn't it be
  nice to have a suitcase like Rincewind's?) and take off for
  Discworld while the rain and gloom of a January thaw engulf the
  northern hemisphere. "Guards! Guards!" is the eighth book in the
  Discworld series, in which Captain Sam Vimes of Ankh-Morpork's
  Night Watch gives up drinking and gets married (just the opposite
  of most folks). I don't read the Discworld novels in order any
  more, just pick up a favorite and start in. The blurbs on the
  back and cover pages compare Pratchett to Charles Dickens
  (Pratchett is better), Chaucer, "J.R.R. Tolkien with a sharper,
  more satiric edge," and P.G. Wodehouse. I think any author who
  garners comparisons with such wildly disparate writers must be in
  a category by himself. Heck, Pratchett IS a category by himself.
  So on to Ankh-Morpork where the Unique and Supreme Lodge of the
  Elucidated Brethren decides, with a little prompting from its
  Supreme Grand Master, to conjure up a dragon. The dragon will
  cause enough death and property damage (including a vegetable
  stand and a brother-in-law's shiny new carriage) so that when the
  Supreme Grand Master's nephew rides into the city with his sharp,
  shiny sword and slays the beast, the grateful citizens will
  proclaim him king. This plot works rather well, except that the
  dragon decides that it wants to be king and cremates its would-be
  slayer. Its requirements are simple and traditional: one
  well-bred virgin per month, and all of the gold, silver, and
  jewels in Ankh-Morpork for its hoard. The new regime fires Sam
  Vimes from his job as captain of the Night Watch. How he wonders,
  could things get worse? Well, at least he's not a virgin and no
  one is talking to him in capital letters.</Text>

  not always agree with some of the conclusions Sutherland comes to

  <Text category="book">I recently finished reading this book. This
  is really a great book and gave me some insight into my own
  behaviour. It would be fair to say that this book has great value
  to those who get through first 3 chapters and understand the
  theory behind rest of the book. Some reviewers have written about
  the validity of the theory iteself. While I am not qualified to
  comment on these reviews, one thing I can definitely conclude is
  that this book provides a solid base to those who are trying to
  understand their own behaviour and trying to achieve improvements
  in it. A theory, that too developed quarter century ago, can not
  be expected to stand 100% vindicated today. The more importent
  question is what use you are trying to put it to. So may be for a
  psyciatrist this is not a great book but for a layman like myself
  this book explains most of the things. After reading this book I
  could find out why I behave the way I behave mostof the times. To
  a certain extent I learnt to control my responses. Also I have a
  feeling that the claims made by Dr. Harris might be quite right
  in 1972 in light of the knowledge, then prevalent. Second
  objection seems to be dividing 5 or 6 billion population in 4
  types of people. I think this conclusion is far from correct. Dr.
  Harris has repeated said that most of the people belong to "I am
  not ok and you are ok" category. Out of the remaining 3
  cattttegories 2 are shared by people who have not had proper
  childhood and the fourth is achieved by enlightenment of an
  individual. The objective here is not to merely categorize, but
  to show that how most of us have the common position "I am not ok
  and you are ok". Now this should not be taken as a gross
  simplification of human nature, but as a fundamental problem in
  human psycology that prevents one from producing rational
  responses. Third critisism on this book stems from the fact Dr.
  Harris seems to quote philosophers with whom he does not agree
  100%. It seems ludicrous to suggest that one must agree 100% with
  somebody else to merely quote a subsection which both of them
  agree upon. I don't think Dr. Harris wrote this book to declare
  to the world that he belongs to or believes in a certain academic
  thought 100%. The books surely derives from various thoughts put
  forward by various intellectuals (with whom he does not agree
  100%) for the benefit of the reader. To call this approach
  pretentious is pretentious iteself. I feel that reader should not
  by biased by comments made by reviewers. Read this book with an
  open mind. Read the chapeters on PAC and marriage, PAC and
  children, PAC and social implications, PAC and moral values. In
  this world that is becoming more and more crooked every other
  day, it tries to teach something good (and this good is not
  subjective or relative but absolute). Thanks</Text>

  <Text category="book">Jesse, 15 lives in Harlem, New York City.
  He is the only child of a bright couple and his best friend, Rise
  is one of his biggest influences. Jesse and Rise grew up
  together. When Rise, 17 turns to crime and joins the Counts, a
  local street gang and insists on bringing Jesse in with him along
  with their friend C.J., Jesse starts to reassess their
  friendship. He sadly realizes that he and Rise are traveling down
  different streets; the drive-by shooting of their friend Bobby,
  14 has left the neighborhood shaken. C.J., a musical prodigy who
  plays piano in their church also has his sights set on a
  different path. It is C.J. and Jesse, a budding young artist who
  is quite talented at drawing who realize they have more in common
  with each other. Rise and the Counts are in for a Count-down;
  sadly, drive-bys claim more casualties. The Counts were described
  as being on the tame end of street gangs; a warring faction
  called the Diablos were responsible for shooting a friend;
  killing a cabbie and later, some members of the Counts. Sidney, a
  kind and fair police officer takes the boys under his wing. He is
  respected in the neighborhood and word on the street was that he
  was a fair man, which he was. When Mason, 19 an older member of
  the Counts was busted for homicide, it was Sidney who took Rise
  and Jesse to the jail ("Iron City") to see the fate in store for
  their former friend. More problems crop up in the neighborhood;
  Rise, seeing a chance to leave Harlem wants to call Jesse and the
  Counts together for a final goodbye. Sadly, that goodbye really
  was the end. This is an excellent book that reflects the city and
  street culture well. The characters are fresh, cutting edge,
  serious and believable. The drawings were excellent and a bonus
  to this book. Jesse, an aspiring cartoonist created two West
  Indian charcters, a wise man and a bird. The bird was a metaphor
  for Jesse and it is through this avian character that he asks
  questions in his drawings that Wise answers. Myers has written
  many excellent books, but I think he really outdid himself with
  this one</Text>

  life in Poland during WWII. He lost both his parents during that

  and then what turned out to be his downfall...with the teenaged

  <Text category="book">This book ranks along side Will Durant's
  "Story of Philosophy" as the best book on Western Philosophy. The
  key difference is that whereas Durant deals only with some
  selected individuals, Russell gives a comprehensive history.
  Topics that get the short shrift in most histories
  (Pre-Socratics, Medieval Philosophy, etc) are given the full
  treatment here. 'HoWP' has an authority that few can match.
  Russell was a great philosopher himself - no history of Western
  Philosophy is complete without a chapter on him! The book is
  strewn with gems of wisdom: 1. "The union of idealism and love of
  power has led men astray throughout history, and continues to do
  so even today." (On Sparta) 2. "Religions that condemn the
  pleasures of the senses drive men towards the pleasures of power.
  Throughout history, power has been the vice of the ascetic." (On
  the clergy in the Middle Ages) 3. "Contempt for happiness is
  usually contempt for other people's happiness, and is an elegant
  disguise for hatred of the human race." (On Continental
  Idealists) At times the book does get a little dense. There is
  only so far Russell is willing to go to make the subject
  accessible to the lay reader. I would especially recommend this
  book for history buffs. Russell dovetails the development of
  Western Philosophy beautifully with European history. There is no
  better way to develop interest in a subject than to read a book
  that connects it with a subject you are already passionate
  about</Text>

  the history and motivation and design decisions behind HLA. They
  also give many good examples, [...], allow you to get a really
  good feel for the important concepts of HLA by running an actual
  federation. One thing I will be looking for is the impact of the
  architecture on simulation performance, scalability in practice
  (as opposed to in theory), and how is HLA likely to evolve over
  the next couple decades. I don't know yet whether the book is
  enough for you to create your first federation. If you really
  have NO background at all in simulation, you will still get a lot
  out of the first couple of chapters, plus the many references to
  articles written on the subject, but don't expect to find the
  other chapters easy. Using my background in simulation systems, I
  can say that HLA seems to have been very well thought out, based
  on real-life simulation systems, and is therefore not trivial.

  section entitled a Compendium. In turn, each section is

  <Text category="book">The theory behind this important collection
  of essays is that &amp;amp;quot;the history of medieval power is
  to be sought in microcosms.&amp;amp;quot; These essays
  demonstrate quite effectively that it can be found there as well.
  Each essay focuses on a facet of the shifting power relationships
  in twelfth and thirteenth century Europe. At issue in each are
  the questions of what or who held the power to command or punish,
  and how that power was obtained, kept and manifested. This is a
  truly enlightening book. Of particular interest are the essays on
  holding power over the truth, as well as those dealing the
  formation of the nobility into a self-consciously chivalric
  warrior class. However, all the essays are intelligent and useful
  explorations into the very nature and meaning of power.

  <Text category="book">A commentary on a book of the Bible will
  generally include the commentator's outline of the structure of
  that book. A good outline can greatly enhance one's understanding
  of a biblical book, so such outlines are important. Rarely,
  though, do commentators say much about how their outlines are
  derived. This book, which is based on Professor Lee's doctoral
  dissertation, describes and illustrates a method for outlining
  the structure of a large section of biblical text. This method,
  called "conceptual analysis", is a modern version of form
  criticism developed by Lee's advisor, Rolf Knierim. Lee describes
  conceptual analysis as an iterative process, where one begins by
  dividing a text into smaller units with coherent themes. One then
  takes a deeper look to determine how the units fit together into
  an overall structure for the text. Finally, the outline is
  critically evaluated and the steps repeated as needed. Lee
  demonstrates the method on Num. 10:11-36:13, a challenging
  section of text that has been outlined in several different ways.
  He divides this section into 36 units, discussing with each one
  the rationale for his choices. He then argues persuasively that
  the key unit for the organization of the section is Num.
  13:1-14:45, the account of the exploration of the Promised Land
  by 12 scouts, the largely negative report the scouts present to
  the people, and Israel's subsequent rejection of God's plan to
  bring them into the Promised Land. The pivotal events in this
  unit largely determine the form and content of the rest of the
  section. Conceptual analysis is an attempt to make the outlining
  of a text into a "scientific" process, with the goal of deriving
  a structure from a text rather than imposing a structure upon a
  text. There is no way to completely mechanize such a process,
  however. Some subjectivity is inevitable, and any outline will
  highlight some features of a text and deemphasize others. In my
  opinion, one good measure of the value of an outline is the
  amount of fruit it yields in insight into the text. By this
  criterion, I believe that Lee's outline of Num. 10:11-36:13 earns
  high marks. His outline helps give satisfying answers to a number
  of questions about the text, as he explains in the latter stages
  of the book. It is rare that a dissertation on form critical
  issues would be interesting to more than a handful of
  specialists. This book is a notable exception, and I
  enthusiastically recommend it to all serious students of the book
  of Numbers.</Text>

  <Text category="book">The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy is the
  number one best selling book in the galaxy for many reasons. One
  it is slightly cheaper than others, but most important is that it
  has the words'Don't Panic' written in bold letters on the cover.
  The story of The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy revolves around
  this remarkable book. This story strangely begins when the earth
  is destroyed by a Vogon construction fleet clearing the way for a
  hyper space express way. The last Earthman, Arthur Dent, is saved
  by his best friend Ford Prefect, who is actually an alien that
  comed from a small palnet somewhere in the vecinity of
  Betelgeuse. They are soon thrown out of an air lack and rescued
  by the Heart of Gold using the Infinate Improbability Drive.
  Inside they meet up with Zaphod Beeblebrox, the two headed, three
  armed president of the galaxy, Trillian, an Earthwoman who Arthur
  failed to pick up and wnt with Zaphod, and Marvin, a parinoid
  android. This book tells of there amazing adventures throughought
  the galaxy. These adventures involve mice, an abandonded planet,
  a rather suprised sperm whale, and the number 42. I loved this
  book for many reasons. One reason is that it is filled with
  unexpected humor. Another is that it gives a good spin on life. I
  could always count on this book to cheer me up. Don't just stop
  with this book there are many others in this series.</Text>

  his curmudgeonly outbursts amusing. More importantly, De Wall's
  arguments for the existence of culture in animals are persuasive
  (not that I needed much persuading), and his use of anecdotes
  keep the book entertaining. I'm looking at my pet pooches in a
  whole new way these days</Text>
  <Text category="book">As mentioned, this book is amazingly
  compact, cramming three semesters of calculus and a bit of
  ordinary differential equations into just 800 pages. That
  conciseness also implies that much explanatory material and many
  illustrative examples are missing. The authors mention in the
  preface that "classifiers of calculus books would call this a
  traditional book. Most theorems are proved or left as exercises
  to prove..." Nearly every result in this book has an accompanying
  proof. For those with a serious interest in mathematics, this is
  a useful resource. For most others, the presence of so many
  proofs can be overwhelming and probably is a turnoff. Included
  with the book is a one-page detachable reference card containing
  a massive amount of valuable information, including common rules
  for derivatives and integrals, geometric formulas, a few
  conversion factors, trigonometric identities and graphs (very
  useful!), and more. The book also has a three-page comprehensive
  table of integrals in the inside back cover and a listing of
  geometric formulas in the front, along with a commemorative
  timeline and portraits featuring the deceased European males who
  made calculus possible. Given all of this, I would highly
  recommend this book as an 800-page calculus reference text, or
  maybe as a text in an honors calculus sequence that expects to
  use the text throughout multiple semesters - then using it saves
  you money. But for those who don't have a super-strong background
  or interest in math, those who are just taking calculus for a
  requirement or those who have never seen calculus before, or for
  those who are just plain math-phobic - using this book just
  doesn't make any sense. I wouldn't recommend it. For those who
  are stuck with this book for a course, I'd suggest looking for
  another book to help you out. One possible book has already been
  mentioned in another review: Silvanus Thompson and Martin
  Gardner's "Calculus Made Easy", a book that dates back originally
  to 1910 (!). I've read parts of it, and the book looks good to
  me. I'm sure that there are many other helpful books; try
  checking your local/university library or looking on Amazon for
  ideas. An extra calculus textbook that's more student-friendly
  might be a good idea. As for the pages falling out, I haven't had
  a problem with it (I have the 8th edition), but I don't use the
  book all that much. I haven't found any serious errors in the
  text, but I haven't read everything thoroughly, having only used
  the text for Calc III. And, yeah, getting the student solutions
  manual would probably be a good idea</Text>

  (2/06) It's an ordinary Sunday afternoon for Odelia Grey. An
  afternoon spent with her dysfunctional family means a stop at the
  grocery store on the way home to buy her favorite comfort food,
  Stouffer's Macaroni and cheese, to get the taste of her family
  (and her rotten date on Saturday night) out of her mouth. And
  then she gets the phone call.....her dear friend Sophie, a
  staunch supporter, mentor and banner carrier for BBW----big,
  beautiful women---has committed suicide. As she struggles to cope
  with this heartbreaking news, she has more disturbing news piled
  on. Not only did Sophie commit suicide, she did it in front of
  dozens of eyewitnesses on her adult website!!! With the emergence
  of more hidden facets of Sophie's life, Odelia finds it difficult
  to reconcile this new Sophie to the Sophie she knew and loved. As
  Odelia digs deeper into Sophie's life, both past and present, she
  comes to the conclusion that Sophie would not, under any
  circumstances, kill herself. With backup help from a memorable
  cast of characters, Odelia sets out to clear her friend's name
  and in the process gains a new acceptance of herself as a fat
  woman in a thin society. This book was enjoyable on so many
  levels. First and foremost, it is very well written. Second, it
  confronts the prejudice that is openly shown to fat people in
  today's society and gives a gentle nudge toward developing
  tolerance. And finally, it leaves you impatiently awaiting the
  next installment in the life of Odelia Patience Grey......the
  best new heroine to spring from the pages of a book in
  years.</Text>
  <Text category="book">Peter Allen takes three of the most
  compelling aspects of human history--sex, disease, and
  religion--and weaves them together in a fascinating exposition of
  how religious authorities in the West have viewed disease since
  the late Middle Ages. His book discusses the histories of
  lovesickness, leprosy, syphilis, plague, masturbation, and of
  course AIDS. For each disease (and yes, masturbation was
  considered a serious disease well into the 20th Century!), he
  discusses how sex, and the sins associated with it, figured into
  the religious and popular views of illness. Allen's book is
  meticulously researched (he read texts in the original French,
  Latin, German, and Italian) and elegantly written. It is a far
  easier read than most academic works. Most importantly, it offers
  insight into how religious and sexual intolerance can hamper the
  fight against disease, even in today's world</Text>
  <Text category="book">There are two different types of Larkin
  poem. The first type, mostly written before 1955, are influenced
  by Yeats and Auden and are mediocre. The second, written when he

  twentieth century man - atheistic, obsessed with sex, regretting
  the loss of faith and the old certainties. He takes these
  subjects and turns them into glorious poems. But here's the
  really incredible thing: he uses ordinary, uncomplicated
  language. No tricks, no arcane allusions, just plain English. It
  can't be denied that the voice is bleak, and it is too

  <Text category="book">Pojman does a superb job of illustrating
  many different approaches to ethics, providing examples of
  practical application of each. This helps the reader develop a
  critical mind, capable of reasoning his or her way through
  ethical dilemmas that we all face on a daily basis. Pojman is not
  afraid to go for the jugular on approaches in which he finds
  serious flaws, such as cultural and ethical relativism. The
  reader will find that Pojman does not adhere to one ethical
  theory in particular, but rather calls for reason and judgment,
  based on strong moral principles, in every situation. Some
  situtations call for a utilitarian approach, some for a
  virtue-ethical approach. Whatever approach he takes, however,
  will be based in thorough and sound reasoning. This book makes
  its readers want to be better people.</Text>

  <Text category="book">This is an excellent book. Its academic /

  <Text category="book">This book is a personal re-examination of
  food--what we eat, and why we eat it. In this book, Prentice
  examines food customs and traditions, searching for their
  physiological and environmental rationale. Her primary
  observation about food traditions is that they are strictly tied
  to the seasons, and thus the continual year-round availability of
  our foodstuffs has resulted in loss of much traditional knowledge
  about what is good for us and what isn't. In recognition of the
  essential seasonality of foods, Prentice organizes this book into
  the thirteen moons that make up the year, from the famine moon,
  to the sap moon, from the egg moon to the corn moon, from the
  blood moon to the wolf moon. Each chapter describes the ecology
  that led to the association between a particular food item and a
  specific time of the year. In the chapters, Prentice discusses
  the nutritional contributions of the featured food items, and how
  her relationship with that food has changed over the years. For
  example, she explains how she used to avoid milk and other dairy
  products, but now relishes them as a gift of love from Mother
  Earth. Each chapter also includes recipes of the season, ranging
  from exotic dishes of non-Western food cultures, like Cardamom
  and Jaggery pudding, to simple directions for lost arts, such as
  rendering pork, or making homemade yogurt and sauerkraut.
  Prentice was once a strict vegan, who for health reasons,
  eventually found herself drawn to a diet which includes animal
  products, but not the products of industrial agriculture. There
  is much that vegetarians and vegans would not like in Prentice's
  essays, since she explains how her 10 years of vegetarianism were
  not healthy for her. Having had the same experience myself after
  being a vegetarian for 20 years, I can appreciate the wisdom in
  what she writes. While vegetarian diets work well for some, they
  are not appropriate for everybody. But at the same time, diets
  that include the consumption of industrially produced and
  processed animal products do nobody any good. We need to be
  willing to recognize our relation and responsibilities to the
  animals that we consume. I first heard of this book when I
  attended a Vermont Localvore potluck at which Prentice was the
  invited guest chef. I was deeply offended then at her attitude,
  when she announced she was going to make a salad using a recipe
  from her book, but lamented the lack of local artichokes or olive
  oil. `How could such a person be associated with local cooking,'
  I wondered, `if she doesn't even have the sense to find out what
  the best local ingredients are and celebrate them, instead of
  parading the products of another region in front of us?' I
  figured that a seasonal local cookbook written by a national
  author would be a worthless concept. Fortunately, that's not what
  this book attempts--instead the book is much more about
  rediscovering our connection to food than about specific local
  recipes. Although she has become famous for leading the concept
  of eating foods only from one's local region, what she urges here
  is really an appreciation for the products of small farms. Thus,
  instead of simply cheering on local food, Prentice argues in this
  book that our industrial agriculture system has torn us away from
  one of the most essential of human traits, our relationship to
  the food that nourishes us. Instead of following diets of
  avoidance, Prentice advocates recognizing the meaning that each
  item of food brings to our lives, and using food to re-establish
  our connection to the land. Indeed, the only foods that Prentice
  avoids are those heavily processed products of industrial
  agriculture: refined sugar, white flour, and pre-packaged
  extruded junk. Although the book contains a few recipes, it is
  not a cookbook, but rather a wake-up call: "Our poor diet is at
  least partly a physical manifestation of a spiritual decay,"
  together with some suggestions of how we can begin the journey
  back to healthy eating</Text>

  <Text category="book">Rawlings explores the lives and interations
  of the odd assortment of people living in Cross Creek, Florida in
  the early 1900s. It is often assigned reading for teens, but I
  doubt that most of them can appreciate it. Her accounts of
  neighbors feuding and subsistance living gives us many lessons in
  human behavior. The lyrical descriptions of wildlife and the
  orange groves and wild landscape are very appealing. Your mouth
  waters as you read her essays on downhome foods like hush
  puppies. She turned those into a cookbook which I'll have to try
  out. Modern readers squirm uncomfortably at her use of the N-----
  word and her characterization of blacks as irresponsible,
  drunken, immoral, etc. It is probably a faithful representation
  of common thinking at the time it was written, so recognize it as
  a snapshot of the times. Then move past that to luxuriate in the
  beautiful passages in the book. (I deducted 1 star for this) The
  reader becomes absorbed in Rawlings' love of the land and the
  creation of a home. It gives much the same feelings as A Year in
  Provence or Under a Tuscan Sun</Text>

  those games. I loved the entire transformation and how gradually
  even the sith were headed like the Jedi in EP3. It an amazing
  story and can't wait to a sequel if any.</Text>
  <Text category="book">Cajun Cuisine is, without a doubt, the best
  Cajun cookbook that I've ever used. I was born and reared in
  Southern Louisiana, and the recipes detailed within closely
  mirror the exact techniques, seasonings, and spices that I had
  learned by watching both my grandmothers in their kitchens, and
  how I was personally taught by my grandfather at his hunting
  camp. You CANNOT go wrong with this book! Jacque</Text>

  <Text category="book">I have got to say that this is definitely
  the best cheesecake book ever. Initially, I was shopping around
  for one since my boyfriend's favorite dessert was cheesecake. I
  ran across this and decided to get it. Well, one of the best
  choices I could ever make, I think. This is an amazing book!
  Starting from the recipes which are so numerous and so varied
  that they have to be divided into beverage-based, chocolate,
  vanilla, candy, etc., even one for light cheesecakes! Honestly,
  deciding which one to try the first time around was the toughest
  challenge when starting out. Well, I followed the instructions
  clearly, as well as the first section on tips to avoid it
  cracking and boy, did it ever come out wonderfully! I never
  looked back. I've baked from it endlessly for some years now,
  tasting practically all of the recipes included. It's gotten to
  the point where I may soemtimes tweak the recipe and/or
  ingredients a bit and it still comes out great! My family has
  enjoyed all sorts of different flavors and many of my family
  members and friends have converted and use nothing but this to
  bake cheesecakes also. My copy is so beat-up from use, it may be
  time to get a new one. Did I mention that this is also a
  beautiful book? Full of wonderful (yummy-looking) glossy
  pictures. My only (tiny) complaint is that on occasion, some of
  the ingredients may be a little hard to get but nothing too major
  and definitely nothing's that stopped me yet. I do have other
  cheesecake books which people have given me over the years but
  due to simplicity, astounding variety and plain old wonderful
  results, this is the one I recommend the most.</Text>

  <Text category="book">Reading late James - particularly "The
  Golden Bowl" - often strikes me as being similar to reading a
  novel in a foreign language whose vocabulary you have mastered
  but whose grammar remains partially a mystery. Anyone who has
  attempted this will recognise the sensation of understanding all
  the words, yet not understanding how they fit together. You read
  a sentence two, three or five times, and it is only then that you
  understand, if at all, the meaning of all the words combined.
  Sometimes the meaning never becomes clear. "Late James" is a
  foreign language, but one in which I have become more fluent over
  the years. When I first read "The Golden Bowl" some years ago I
  understood very little and did not enjoy it. The long, convoluted
  sentences, with so many things only half spoken - and often never
  spoken at all - seemed a vast and elaborate machine which never
  seemed to produce enough to justify its own existence. Yet now,
  having read most of James over the intervening years, I have
  become more fluent in his language, and find the circumlocutions,
  complexities and ellipses of the "late style", if not exactly
  crystal clear, then certainly much clearer, and even rather
  comforting and enjoyable. The subtle discriminations, the way
  James holds up to the light tenuous motives and turns them slowly
  - very slowly - so that their hidden facets become, fleetingly,
  visible; the very real portrayal of interesting characters that
  James reveals; as well as the languorous, unpredictable turns of
  a Jamesian sentence - all offer the kinds of pleasures that no
  other writer (possibly excepting Proust) is able to produce. "The
  Golden Bowl" consists largely of conversations, some continuing
  over many, many pages. The content of those conversations would,
  for most writers, comprise the details between the main actions
  of the plot; and for most writers, those conversations would
  occupy, at most, a few pages. But for James, it is the
  interstices between big events, the dramas, not so much of
  everyday events, but of the subtle daily manipulations, the
  unspoken victories and losses of personal relationships, which
  interest him and which comprise the novel. The subject of "The
  Golden Bowl" is the reciprocal marriages of father and daughter,
  to a pair of former lovers. The novel is about the tensions and
  deceptions, and the manipulations, that arise as a result. Who
  knows what about whom? Who is responsible for what actions? Who
  is deceiving whom, and who has the moral authority as a
  consequence? Ultimately, who, if anyone, triumphs, and is their
  victory a hollow one? These are the sorts of questions James is
  concerned with. "The Golden Bowl" rates as a great novel - one of
  the greatest of the twentieth century - because of these
  qualities as well as its ambiguities. It is also an enjoyable
  novel, but to enjoy it you must first be sympathetic to the sorts
  of concerns James is interested in, and you also need to be
  conversant in his distinctive language. Both of these require -
  or at least I would recommend - first reading James' earlier and
  middle period works. For most of us, late James can be a
  struggle, but one which is justified by its rewards. I don't
  regard reading "The Golden Bowl" as an exercise only for
  academics, pretentious aesthetes or literary masochists, but I
  sympathise with those who do. Giving "stars" to a James novel
  seems a little inappropriate (he is beyond these kinds of
  simplistic judgements), But I have given "The Golden Bowl" four
  stars, because there are times when it strains the patience even
  of those who admire the writing style and enjoy the late James
  novels, and I prefer "The Ambassadors" or "The Wings of the
  Dove". Nevertheless, "The Golden Bowl" is one of the great novels
  in English and is highly recommended to anyone who has read and
  enjoyed James' other novels.</Text>

  <Text category="book">I had a chance to read this book cover to
  cover. All I can say is &amp;amp;quot;absolutely
  outstanding&amp;amp;quot;, short of calling it a historical
  masterpiece in the field. Very rarely do I encounter an
  epidemiology or biostatistic textbook that reads so well. It is
  optimally reader friendly; the author appears to have such a
  talent in explaining some most sophisticated epidemiological and
  statistical concepts in such a simplified language. Yet he does
  not sacrifice the inclusion of some very advanced epidemiological
  and statistical concepts. New concepts such as causal graphs and
  instrumental variables are also included and explained
  beautifully. I strongly recommend this book to all early to
  intermediate graduate students majoring in Epidemiology.
  Established epidemiologists may wish to read this book to refresh

  <Text category="book">This book is packed full of incredible
  devices for any one who enjoys Exalted. The book has a wealth of
  knolage from the first age as well as the age of sorrows. The
  book has a few sections in it that divide the items by uses, that
  is the only way i can discribe it. There is a giant amount of
  artifacts that have nothing to do with combat, and then others
  that are. There is a section on warstriders, basicly single man
  "death machines" that basicly look like Large Metal Robots. Most
  of the items in this volume are very well detailed and all have
  pictures that show you what they would more that likely look
  like. I don't like saying that IS what they look like because,
  well, this is RPing people, things change by a player/GM's
  perception. Anyway, enough of my ramblings, This book rocks and
  has items that range from pens to armor to boots to Royal Class
  Warstriders. This book is about gear in the world of Exalted.

  <Text category="book">I am not going to go over the contents of
  the book, or much about Charles Bukowski, because if you are
  considering this book you must know something about the man and
  his work. I will just give you my impression of this collection
  of work. No collection can ever really be complete, there are
  always new things to add, new commentary, newly discovered works,
  transcripts of records and unpublished letters, but this book
  does an excellent job in its attempt. To me Charles Bukowski will
  always be one of the greatest American writers of the twentieth
  century, because of the sheer brutality and honesty his work
  emanates. It is funny, sad, sadistic, cruel, scathing,
  enlightening and thought provoking. Everything I like to read.
  This is poetry for people who are disgusted by verse of flowers,
  trees and Greek mythology. This is RAW human emotion and
  experience smeared out onto paper. It is not perfect, and it is
  not trying to be. It doesn't always work, but there in lies the
  subtle beauty of Bukowski's efforts. the guts to try. The
  attempts at honesty, clearly blocked by his unwillingness to
  divulge everything, and his cynicism of man. This book has one of
  the most moving, amazing, and insightful poems...or anything
  else...ever written. It is called The Genius Of The Crowd. If you
  read that work of art and are not moved...nothing will. This
  collection is shocking in its beauty, and inspiring by its
  simplicity. Enjoy</Text>
  <Text category="book">Though only a fraction of books have been
  written about the Great War when compared to WWII, there are some
  great ones to pick from. For instance, for a great narrative of
  the American involvement in World War I, try The Doughboys by
  Gary Mead. For a good look at the events of Gallipoli, just last
  year John Laffin wrote The Agony of Gallipoli, which is a
  wonderful brief book on that travesty of warfare. There is a
  great book which chronicles Verdun called The Price of Glory by
  Alistair Horne. The list goes on and on, whether it be Flanders,
  the Somme, Passchendaele, Africa, Jutland, whatever your area of
  interest might be. The point I'm making is, there are plenty of
  specialized accounts of World War I, and even several overviews
  of the war, but John Keegan's THE FIRST WORLD WAR, is a great
  source for an overall study of the war. This book covers it all,
  in brief detail. Accounts are given on virtually every facet of
  the war and even some of the best insight available for the
  events which led up to the war itself. Every aspect of the war is
  given its due diligence here. I've never been a big fan of
  Keegan. His writing, to me, is a struggle at times. This book is
  no exception. It reads somewhat like a 500 page textbook and
  borders on tedious at times. But as much as I dislike his stuffy
  British writing style, he is a virtual historical genius. His
  knowledge and research of the events cannot be faulted, and he
  writes, for the most part, without imparting his own commentary.
  In fact, without prior knowledge, one would hardly surmise that
  Keegan is himself, British. The big exception to that is Keegan's
  typically British hard line stance of not giving the American
  forces their just dues. In this aspect, he even contradicts
  himself in several places. He goes to great length to illustrate
  to the reader that in the early months of 1918, Germany was still
  very much capable of winning the war. The Western front had been
  bolstered by the arrival of German troops from the now defunct
  Eastern front. The new soldiers from the east brought with them,
  battle hardened experience and a mindset that they could triumph,
  as they had in the east. He goes on to tell of how effective
  German advances had been in early April, advancing a fifty mile
  wide front over twenty miles in a matter of days. He then follows
  this sort of information with telling the reader how, though
  ambitious and courageous, the American forces were largely
  inconsequential to the conclusion of the war. When he does
  acknowledge American victory, it is quickly followed with excuses
  for the German forces. That said, if you're seeking information
  about just how American forces rallied to bring an end to over
  four years of war in a matter of a few months, this book will
  infuriate you. However, if you are looking for a good overview of
  the war as a whole, this is one of the best out there. I should
  add, the book has a quite lengthy notes and bibliography section
  for further study. Monty Rainey [...]</Text>
  <Text category="book">If you want to read a book that's exciting,
  happy, and mind-blowing you should read Small Steps. From the
  author that brought you Holes, Louis Sachar, is at his best. This
  book is sort like a sequel to Holes. The main character, Armpit,
  is stuck in a situation which he can not handle. He is in the
  heat in Austin, Texas and I think it is making him do crazy
  illegal things. At first he did not know what he was doing was
  wrong, but now he just hopes he does not have to go back to jail.
  I think that this book is good for any reader 11 and above. Both
  boys and girls would enjoy this book. I think they should make a
  movie out of the book; it would get outstanding remarks. This is
  one out of few books that I could read over and over

  Recipes from Town and Country, Land and Sea, Hearth and Home, is
  a stunning achievement, a magnum opus of a cookbook. Published by
  The Harvard Common Press, the book chronicles the cookery of New
  England from Maine to Connecticut, from the first Thanksgiving to
  the present. Dojny's approach to the region goes well beyond New
  England standbys like clam chowder (although she offers three
  tempting recipes)and spans practically all the food traditions of
  all the ethnic groups who ever called New England home. The eight
  baked bean recipes in the book include one for Cuban Black Beans
  and Yellow Rice and another for West Indian Peas 'n Rice. New
  England cookery has embraced food from all over the world --
  besides Caribbean, you'll find culinary influences of Native
  American, English, Portuguese, Italian, Irish, German
  Scandinavian, Greek, French and Hungarian cooks -- and all are
  represented in this book. Yet, for all its broadness of scope,
  this is a very personal book; Dojny's voice can be heard
  throughout, in the headnotes, sidebars and essays that describe
  the people and places associated with the recipes. The book is
  also a wealth of New England food history and lore, as well as
  tips on cooking techniques and ingredients. Bravo! (Excerpted

  <Text category="book">Horror master Arthur Machen's crowning
  achievement, a still shocking compendium of interwoven short
  horror tales. In late 19th century London, a scientist and an
  unpublished writer join forces as amateur detectives in an
  attempt to solve a minor but puzzling mystery which ultimately
  leads to the discovery of a truly diabolical conspiracy. In the
  course of their investigations, the two men find themselves
  repeatedly surrendering their attention to a series of seemingly
  outlandish tales spun by an assortment of eccentric story
  tellers. The stories, which all deal with imposture of some kind,
  are only tangentially related to each other, yet offer the
  somewhat bumbling sleuths important clues to the mystery at hand.
  Machen builds suspense slowly and methodically, masterfully
  leading the reader on to a completely unexpected, gruesome
  climax. Comical, tragic, sophisticated, violent, horrific, and
  even downright disgusting, THE THREE IMPOSTORS is a classic
  horror novel of sly deception and wit. The 1995 Everyman
  paperback is the only critical edition of this remarkably rich
  book released to date, offering a scholarly introduction (by
  editor David Trotter) that carefully details Machen's main
  influences (chiefly Robert Louis Stevenson) and themes (imposture
  of various kinds, also derived from Stevenson). A short text
  summary nicely encapsulates the narrative's various twists and
  turns. Finally, a section entitled "Machen and His Critics"
  provides a welcome offering of mostly contemporaneous critical
  responses to this remarkable book; while many of these reviews
  were laudatory, quite a few passionately outraged quotes reveal
  just how shocking THE THREE IMPOSTORS must truly have been in its
  time</Text>

  <Text category="book">I wish I could give this book four and a
  half stars instead of four; I can't quite justify five stars in
  my mind. Two of the stories were definitely good: the first,
  "masked Riders" by Parhelion, and the third, "Ricochet" by BA
  Tortuga. I enjoyed both, but was not particularly snowed by the
  intensity of the conflict/plot line or the main characters and
  their relationships. Not so the second story: "Hung Up" by Cat
  Kane was a powerful, intense and moving story about two
  delightful yet flawed characters who had secrets that tore their
  relationship up until they were able to work their ways
  (separately) around the issues. That story deserved a five stars
  plus rating and I wish Kane would turn it into a full length
  novel and develop the characters and their backgrounds more. This
  book is an excellent read both for the plot line and the erotic
  substance. Enjoy</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">The story of "Alice in Wonderland" was
  controversial from the moment that the Reverend Charles Lutwidge
  Dodgson, aka Lewis Carroll, wrote it. Some took the story as
  horror rather than a childhood fantasy. Others consider Alice's
  journey as a trip into or through insanity. For better or worse,
  Disney did capture many of these elements, and the same
  criticisms of the books that form the basis of this film apply to
  the film. However, there are also those who loved the books and
  loved the film. Normally I recommend Disney classis without
  reservations. In the case of this movie, I will keep a couple of
  provisos. Alice is a young girl bored by her lessons. As the
  length of the lessons grows, Alice soon drifts off, until a white
  rabbit passes by, muttering to himself that he is late. Alice
  follows the white rabbit and falls into a rabbit hole that seems
  to fall forever. Luckily for Alice her dress opens out into a
  kind of parachute and slows her descent. Once at the bottom of
  the hole, Alice discovers a door into which she is unable to pass
  because the door is too small. However, there is a vial labeled
  "drink me" that Alice discovers makes her small enough to go
  through the door. Alice is soon on her way into a series of
  surreal adventures that are in the best tradition of adult
  animation. Indeed, Alice might have worked better as an adult
  story given the number of references to adult vices and frailties
  throughout the film. Even the fundamental basis of Alice's
  journey through Wonderland owes as much to psychological
  references as it does childhood fantasies. The ending of Alice's
  journey in particular is quite frightening, especially to younger
  children, embodying all that can be horrible in nightmares. I
  remember seeing "Alice in Wonderland" as a child, and I remember
  I thought the ending was scary, and I was relieved when Alice was
  able to escape back to the normal world. Given that this film is
  well over fifty years old, I was disturbed by the smoking
  caterpillar, if for no other reason than our current knowledge of
  what smoking does. The smoke did negatively affect Alice as it
  made her cough. Perhaps there is an object lesson for children
  here. While some consider many of the references to allude to
  drugs, I think that is a modern interpretation. I think eating or
  drinking items to get larger or smaller was merely a convenient
  plot device for the author rather than an allegory for drug use.
  Remember that this story was first published in 1869. I believe
  this film is excessively criticized by those who do not like its
  style and the post-era associations with negative elements that
  were never intended by the original author and by Disney. For all
  these provisos, this film is excellent. It matches "Fantasia" in
  its surreal visions, and the construct and tying together of the
  individual stories is superb. The animation is marvelous as well,
  readily illustrating the vision of Alice's journey. This movie is
  one of those rare Disney films that I am unable to recommend to
  all viewers. Whether you will enjoy this film is strictly a
  matter of personal taste. If you enjoy animation oriented toward
  adults, then you may find this animation a treat. If you are
  open-minded about the story and consider when the story was
  written and animated, you may also find that you enjoy it. I do
  recommend this movie for slightly older children, perhaps 8 and
  above, considering some of the disturbing images. Good
  luck!</Text>

  <Text category="dvd">At 23 years of age, I can truly say that I
  have been a lifetime fan of Sesame Street. Watching the 3-DVD set
  of Sesame Street - Old School, Vol. 1 has been both nostalgic and
  enlightening. Because I was born practically a decade after most
  of the material on this set originally aired, I expected most of
  the content to be new to me (I was barely a year old when Mr.
  Hooper's death was explained to the world), but that was not the
  case. Many of the short films and interstitials were familiar
  (and not just because I used to watch Sesame Unpaved on Noggin)
  to me as a viewer from the mid-1980s, and I think that just
  underscores the quality the show has exhibited from the
  beginning. Sesame Street truly revolutionized children's
  programming, not just because it was educational, but because it
  was (and remains) entertaining, not pandering. I'll admit, seeing
  Gordon with an afro, Orange Oscar and the first few tries at Big
  Bird's head still freak me out a bit (as they did when I saw them
  on Noggin several years back), but the show itself is just as
  good as I ever remembered, something that cannot be said for most
  nostalgia entertainment (like Transformers or He-Man or JEM). The
  set contains five full episodes from the first five seasons, and
  54 (the liner notes are incorrect, they should have asked Count
  for help) bonus clips. The set also includes the 25 minute
  pitch-film that was made before the series originally aired,
  explaining Sesame Street's message and motive. Although the
  episodes have a disclaimer that it is not necessarily intended
  for today's pre-school children, I believe they would probably
  enjoy "classic" Street even more than the current lineup of
  shows. The fact that today's pre-schoolers may be more advanced
  than the Sesame Street of yore can really be attributed to Sesame
  Street itself, and that's pretty cool. Still, I personally
  appreciate that the aim of the set is at adults, because so many
  of us associate our childhood with Sesame Street. A booklet is
  included that gives a brief overview of the series from the first
  five years and I found it informative. According to Muppet
  Central, a few sketches were altered or removed for music
  copyright issues (one with Stevie Wonder, one with Rogers
  &amp;amp; Hammerstein), but because I never saw the originals, I
  found nothing amiss. What astounded me more than anything was
  that at the end of the first five years, more than 600 episodes
  of the show had been produced. No wonder they can't release full
  seasons! Although the full-length episodes are great, my favorite
  part are the additional sketches from each respective season.
  Seeing Kermit sing "Bein' Green" in its original form, the
  "Bread, Milk and Butter" cartoon and the "In in the Sky with
  Diamonds" parody is a real treat. The picture quality is great --
  especially considering the program's age (and the fact that it
  was one of the first programs to be recorded on video, although
  film was used for most of the interstitials) -- I doubt the show
  ever looked as good as it looks right now. The sound quality is
  good too -- mono of course -- but clear and crisp. Overall, I
  highly recommend this set for anyone who loves or loved Sesame
  Street. For those who were born after these episodes aired (like
  me), looking back at the beginning is really special. It is clear
  that everyone involved had a true love for teaching and
  interacting with children and taking television to another
  level</Text>

  make ends meet and then she gets a job and takes on a Giant
  Corporation in a Court Of Law.Julia manages to extract a lot of
  information fom people mainly through her mammary glands and the
  benefits of a Wonderbra but that is just about all that this
  movie has going for it. I give this film 5 stars because Julia
  does look pretty attractive in it at most times</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">This film can be interpreted any number of
  ways: as a farce; a tragedy; or just plain Shakespearean comedy.
  Brenda Blethyn has, in the past, acted in each of these genres
  and she brings that experience into Saving Grace with exquisite
  skill</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">I tried to rent this DVD from an online
  service about a week ago. Unfortunately, the DVD was damaged and
  unplayable, but not in the usual way I've seen before (like a
  disc cracked all the way through). It looked like someone had
  turned the playable side face-up and tapped a small nail with a
  hammer on it. The cracks had that kind of splintery pattern like
  a broken window. Anyway, I returned the copy and ordered another,
  which I received today. Again, this one is also unplayable and is
  cracked in an odd way. I just reported this problem online to the
  DVD rental company and ordered a replacement copy. However, I let
  them know that they may want to check their inventory of this DVD
  as someone may be intentionally destroying the DVDs. If I get
  another one that is cracked or unplayable in any way, I'm going
  to just buy a copy because the movie must really have gotten
  under someone's skin for them to do something like that.</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">This movie is a scream! I laughed until I
  thought I was going to die. Comedy doesn't get any better than
  this. The characters are incredible. It's amazing the actors
  could keep straight faces while making this movie! Do yourself a
  favor and watch this movie! It's even better the second time
  around</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">"Ils se mari&amp;#x1A;rent et eurent
  beaucoup d'enfants" ("Happily Ever After") is a cleverly written
  examination of contemporary views on love, lust, marriage,
  infidelity, and the single life. Writer/Director/Actor Yvan Attal
  has come up with a winner, an entertaining, funny, and ultimately
  thoughtful treatise on how we cope with partnering. Three men
  work together in a car dealership. Vincent (Yvan Attal) is the
  apparently happily married man with a beautiful wife Gabrielle
  (Charlotte Gainsbourg) and child. Georges (Alain Chabat) on the
  other hand is in a tumultuous marriage with Nathalie (Emmanuelle
  Seigner) who has gender issues that go far beyond feminism and
  negatively influence their child. Fred (Alain Cohen) is single,
  bedding every lovely woman he encounters, balancing trysts
  between mornings, afternoons, and evenings and is deeply envied
  for his Don Juanism. But Fred actually longs for the sense of
  belonging that married men enjoy. The men's lives intertwine on
  many levels. Most important, we discover that Vincent has a lover
  (Angie David) despite his idyllic married life and while it is
  Georges whom one would expect to seek solace from a lover, he
  remains faithful to his nagging wife! Gabrielle senses Vincent's
  affair and encounters a sexy man in a music shop (Johnny Depp)
  who begins to preoccupy her thoughts. She is a real estate broker
  and comes close to an assignation with a client but remains
  faithful. All the while she daydreams about her brief encounter
  with Depp and satisfies her wandering eye with those memories.
  Fred discovers that one of his paramours is pregnant and happily
  decides to leap into the married fray. The only 'adults' sharing
  advice here are Vincent's long married parents (Anouk
  Aim&amp;#x1A;e and Claude Berri in very welcome comeback cameos!)
  and it is this 'standard' that adds the final humor to the film.
  The manner in which all three men deal with their living
  situations asks as many questions as it gives answers. Attal
  finds joy in all forms of coupling and is careful to offer all
  sides of decisions his characters make in arriving at what
  provides them happiness. This is a smart movie with terrific
  twists. There is just enough slapstick (an all out food fight
  between Vincent and Gabrielle - real life husband and wife team
  Attal and Gainsbourg - that proves to be one of the fun-loving
  bits of silliness that binds their marriage) to keep the mood
  light. Not a profound film, but a joyous French comedy handled by
  total pros! In French and English with subtitles. Recommended.

  <Text category="dvd">perhaps the greatest cinematic experience of
  our generation. although, I believe I was in a different state of
  mind when I watched this stuff in college. brilliant</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">if you are a GHITS SAC fan this DVD is a
  must, series wise the dvd contains 4 new episodes and the
  tachikoma stories are back as well, in fact the tachikoma's are
  now back in action in the series Too. Graphic wise, 2nd gig drops
  the funny pastel look of the first season and returns to its dark
  look as it was in the first movie, the CG is allot more
  fine-tuned and the action is awesome!!!, the opener has also
  improved significantly for the series!!!, Sound wise the series
  is awesome as usual 5.1 DTS Japanese &amp;amp; 5.1 DTS English,
  with stereo for both and there are English subtitles if you chose
  to run it with Japanese audio. Overall they squealed SAC season 1
  perfectly, this not a series to miss if you're a shell
  fan!</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">I was one of those that never got a chance
  to sit down during the live broadcast to watch Live 8 and
  certainly regretted that. However, I was fortunate enough to find
  this copy at Amazon and it's been everything I had expected and
  more. I'm a huge Pink Floyd fan and their performance alone was
  worth the price of the box set not to mention all of the other
  fantastic performances. I would highly recommend this box set to
  any music fan from any generation--truly a "must have" for
  anyone's collection!</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">I thought the first Ice Age was great. This
  one is good, not great. They really used scrat better this time
  than before, but the rest of the characters were.....not
  undeveloped, but it just didn't have as many hilarious
  situations. Sid is as hilarious as ever, but manny and diego
  doen't do as much. ITs a good, fun movie, but its not as good as
  the first one, rent it though, it does have some hilarious
  scenes</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">We purchased this DVD because we really need
  to work with our son on his reading and it's a great supplement
  to reading books. He loves this DVD and we love the variety in
  it's approach. We didn't realize until we watched it with our
  kids that so much of what we viewed as children really stuck with
  us through the years</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">WOW! What more can I say! Just watching this
  was an absolutely extraordinary experience. This is a "behind the
  scenes" look at photography. It gets you up close and personal
  with the photographers and lets you know what is involved in
  trying to capture the "shot of a lifetime". I own many National
  Geographic books, but you won't be able to appreciate what goes
  into each photograph without watching this DVD. Even those who
  are not interested in photography will be able to appreciate
  it</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">I LOVED "Never Cry Wolf"!!! I saw it years
  ago on video, but can only imagine the DVD is as good or better.
  I was disappointed to see that it was listed with 'The Bear' to
  buy together.... I love Anthony Hopkins, and the Bear was one of
  the worst movies I have EVER seen. Don't let the pairing with
  'The Bear' scare you off. "Never Cry Wolf" is excellent! Sorry
  Tony :-) Okay, I just realized that 'The Edge' was the one with
  Anthony Hopkins... my apologies to the Bear! Anyway, get "Never
  Cry Wolf"! You won't be disappointed!!</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">In America is a near perfect movie dealing
  w/ grief and learning to live again after tragedy. It is also
  about hope. The characters are engaging and each one is dealing
  with grief in their own way. They are all trying to find a new
  life literally in Amerca and figuratively w/ in themselves after
  a variety of tragedies and set backs. The only real downside I
  can note on this movie is that I would have liked a little more
  back ground on Frankie and Mateo but I think the movie tries hard
  to put you in the midst of these lives without arbitrary
  flashbacks. Besides, a great story the cinematograpy is well
  suited with its combination of views through a child's camcorder
  and closer scenes of the city and family life. I especially liked
  ths subtle way the camera shows the changing of seasons. If you
  want to enjoy a good story and a bit of tear jerker thent his is
  a must see. If for nothing else than the performances of "Mateo"
  and young "Kristie." Just amazing.</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">The print looks like you're watching it
  through muddy water; is this something to do with the unclear
  "public domain" status of this and other of Capra's works?
  Doesn't he have a family that could help out his DVDs the way
  that Chaplin's family has done, or even, to use the opposite
  extreme, the family of Edgar Ulmer, who have released superlative
  versions of some pretty dicey movies? The point is that if people
  are paying for something they deserve to get it served up nice,
  and all the various DVDS of MEET JOHN DOE are painful to watch.
  We've heard for years of the re-worked ending of the film, and
  that another one exists (or existed at one time). Bring it on!
  For now the pleasure is nearly entirely in watching Gary Cooper
  react to Barbara Stanwyck's pure life. It's sort of like BALL OF
  FIRE but a bit more subtle. Moviemakers knew they were on to
  agood thing teaming the two, because Cooper's slow-moving, nearly
  snakelike screen presence got an injection of caffeine when
  placed next to Stanwyck's vibrant beauty and her gorgeous clear
  gaze and complexion. She doesn't even have to speak, she emanates
  something very basic in her bones and her posture. Okay, the
  movie writes itself into a corner, for what else is going to
  happen except that if Gary Cooper is not going to kill himself
  the movie will break the trust it's established with the viewers.
  This has always been DOE's problem, that it has to cheat to come
  out ahead of itself, and it didn't work in 1943 and it still
  isn't working now. It's great up until about an hour and fifteen
  minutes; then you feel the gears start to whine and complain as
  "Hollywood" tries to solve a basically philosophical
  dilemma</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">Back in the 1980s, back before every
  television show was "CSI: City Of Your Choice" and "Law &amp;amp;
  Order: Crime Division of Your Choice," there was a veritable
  plethora of well-written, clever, hour-long mystery programmes -
  "Magnum P.I.," "Murder, She Wrote," "Moonlighting," "Hart to
  Hart," "The A-Team," to name just a few. And this was when most
  people still only had three commercial networks to choose from
  (not counting PBS). But far and away, the best of these mystery
  shows (and perhaps the most under-rated) was "Remington Steele,"
  in which Pierce Brosnan (with second billing!) and Stephanie
  Zimbalist fought crime with style, dash, wit, comedy, and a bit
  of romance. The series, with its rat-a-tat dialogue, vaguely Deco
  feel (a slight Deco revival was the only good thing about `80s
  d&#239;&#191;&#189;cor), and occasional zaniness, at times
  harkens back to the wonderful Preston Sturges-esque screwball
  comedies of the 1930s and `40s. Indeed, it's clear from the
  moment that Brosnan appears on the screen in episode one of
  season one that not only did he have the star power of Classic
  Hollywood, but he was a Cary Grant for our times; devastatingly
  handsome in dapper Saville Row suits with an accent as charming
  and distinctive as Grant's. (As an aside, it's also clear that
  Brosnan was born to play James Bond - truly, who was surprised
  that he was bestowed with the honor, albeit belatedly? We won't
  get into the infamous Season Five vs. Bond debacle.) In the
  entertainment field, there are actors-with-a-lowercase-"a"
  (pretty much everyone falls into this category nowadays),
  Actors-with-a-capital-"A" (truly impressive sorts, such as Judi
  Dench, Vanessa Redgrave, and Anthony Hopkins), and then there are
  Stars. Brosnan is clearly the lattermost, bright and luminous.
  Zimbalist, as sleuth Laura Holt, is spunky, and makes a valiant
  attempt to be Rosalind Russell to Brosnan's Grant, but, somehow,
  she falls slightly flat. Nevertheless, there's no denying the
  chemistry between the two, which is what really "makes" the show.
  (This is particularly remarkable considering that the two
  notoriously didn't get along whilst filming the series.)
  References to Classic Hollywood are constant, and amusing -
  Remington Steele, the (sort of) reformed
  con-man-with-a-heart-of-gold has an encyclopedic knowledge of
  film, and often inadvertently stumbles across the solution to the
  weekly puzzle by drawing a comparison to a classic film. ("Joseph
  Cotton, Orson Wells, `The Third Man,' British Lion Film
  Corporation, 1949." is a particular favorite throughout the run
  of the series, as are Cary Grant films and, ironically, the
  occasional Bond reference.) The show was scored by the wonderful
  Henry Mancini, he of "Charade" (A Grant reference, yet again!),
  "The Pink Panther," and "Breakfast at Tiffany's" fame (among many
  others), which of course, adds to the caper/romantic feel of the
  show. (By the way, I'll take the somewhat chaste clinches of
  Remington and Laura over the sordidness of "Sex and the City" to
  daydream about any day of the week!) I'm so pleased that
  Remington Steele has been released on DVD. I was seven years old
  when it debuted, and thoroughly enjoyed it at the time (I was a
  sophisticated child). But I hadn't seen it since, and once again,
  have found myself charmed by each and every episode. For those
  who are too young to remember the series, check it out - it's
  much more worthwhile than anything on the air now, and for those
  of you who *do* remember it, revisit. It's worth your time and
  money.</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">...But I'm giving season four 4 stars,
  because there aren't any subtitles in this set. They also didn't
  have subtitles for season 3, but they did had subtitles for
  seasons 1 &amp;amp; 2. Strange, huh? However, the quality of the
  DVDs are fine and the episodes, of course, are wonderful to
  watch. At the end of this season the Meathead is supposed to
  graduate and move out for good, but he decides to stay with the
  Bunkers a little longer, so he can get his Masters degree. There
  aren't any special features or anything in this DVD set, but as
  long as the episodes are uncut, I'm happy. If you're a fan of the
  show, this DVD set is a MUST-HAVE!</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">We have the kind of family where we promised
  that all ex's and all family children, blood related or not,
  would be family. People think I'm strange because my friendship
  with my husband's ex and her family is so important to me. She
  was visiting us and our granddaughter in Ontario, CAN, she lives
  in L.A. and she wakens to classical music every morning. I
  decided to put on Concert for George, which always brings me to
  tears, but she never took her eyes off of the screen. She
  especially enjoyed Ravi Shankar and his daughter's opening to the
  concert and educated us on what the music meant. As I told my
  husband...no person I have shared this DVD with has ever left it
  with a 'so what' opinion. They all loved it and I think, most of
  my friends have it by now, Beatle lovers or not. Thanks to all
  who made this a tribute to George, but also a way to educate
  people about his talents, his many, many friends, his loving wife
  and son, all of whom, obviously adored George and his music, as
  do I....and my close friend Mary</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">Feeding the cat...those girls shold put on a
  sweater. Love this movie, 50's detective noir set in 70's
  California. The beach, the hospital, Mexico, the supermarket,
  it's all great - and the theme song keeps going throughout over
  and over. Final scene pays homage to The Third Man, beautiful. A
  bit of violence, but "That's how I treat someone I love, and I
  don't even like you". Never seen an Elliot Gould movie I like
  more than this, &amp;amp; it's my favorite Altman as well</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">Our one year old loves this one, and so do
  I. The music is wonderful. The creative incorporation of
  Vivaldi's Four Seasons and Monet's Masterpieces are entertaining
  and educational. The children, little puppets and sequences with
  toys and nature makes this interesting for our child. We watch
  this one most of all the Baby Einstein's that we have.</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">My son was over 2 before we introduced BE
  videos. There are definitely those which cater to the younger
  baby with lots of random images, but this one is great in that it
  has puppet shows with a little plot, as well as discrete
  integrated units for each of the seasons. Unlike some of the
  other BE's with random visuals, here the visuals truly support
  the learning objective desired. Concur with other reviewers as
  well that this is the most robust BE video in Bonus Features. It
  has both puppet shows and another short learning video of all the
  seasons. And no I didn't care for the commercial either...</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">special effects have come along way from
  1974 when westworld first came out,but this little gem still
  hangs head and shoulders above most sci-fi entertainment. welcome
  to delos,vacation spot of the future,where you can have a once
  and a lifetime fantasy come true. you may choose
  westworld,romanworld,and meadevilworld! you can,for $1000.00 a
  day(1974 prices) you can live out your most secert fantisies.it's
  all set up to please you and you can't get hurt. of course if
  that were true then we have no movie. soon after the latest batch
  of people get to the park,the robots begin to have
  breakdowns,like a virus(i still remember the reviews calling the
  idea of computers getting viruses as "to far out there,no one
  will believe it" wonder if they still think so). james brolin and
  richard benjemin are two friends enjoying westworld when the
  whole park goes on the blink and the robots start to kill thr
  guest. the final chase(with evil robot yul brynner,still dressed
  as chris from his stint in the maganfict seven cloths)is very
  thrilling and the whole movie has the feel of a park ride gone
  bad. a very fun movie</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">I first caught The Black Swan several years
  ago on television and was immediately blown away. Sure, it's just
  a Swashbuckler, just a Pirate film - with the usual plot, the
  usual bits and pieces. There's nothing outrageously distinctive
  about The Black Swan, at least at first sight. Ty Power stars as
  Jamie Boy, expert pirate who ends up by plot machinations in the
  employ of ex-pirate and now governer of Jamaica, Captain Morgan
  Laird Cregar). Morgan's been given a pardon for his dastardly
  deeds and with his new title attempts to rid the seas of the
  dastardly buccaneers, sending Jamie Boy off to find George
  Sanders' Captain Leech. Only there's a twist in the mix - and
  some dastardly fop's out to make a mockery of Morgan by using
  Leech as his private pirate to ruin the governer. To make matters
  worse Jamie not only seemingly disappears - apparently in league
  with the nefarious Leech, but he also kidnaps the previous
  governer's daughter, played with feistyness by Catherien
  O'Hara..... So it's all the usual stuff - kidnapping,
  sword-fighting, stealing, drinking, pacts with arch enemies and
  stock characters throughout. But you know what - it's not that
  you know what you're getting, it's that you get a whole lot more
  than you ever thought you would. Sure, everything's the same, but
  somehow strangely different. The story and characters are as seen
  before - but with the likes of Sanders, Power and O'Hara as the
  love interest, and the great character actor Cregar playing
  against type - you have life breathed into the character's that's
  so often lacking. And the original story by one Rafael Sabatini -
  who also brought us Captain Blood and The Sea Hawk - is a
  rip-roaring boys-own adventure. Director Henry King - no stranger
  to producing similar adventure styled flicks - cracks the picture
  along with some sense of urgency. It's a spare, fluid film with a
  simple, but fun, narrative and visual splendour that puts other
  films, even those made today, out to pasture. This DVD manages to
  capture that splendour in abundance - the technicolor photography
  is gorgeously rendered herein, with all of the detailed
  production and costune design seen at its best. Just check out
  the restoration comparison to see how good. In addition the disc
  also features a fine commentary from historian Rudy Behlmer. If
  you want a cracking piece of entertainment that puts shame to
  modern counterparts of the genre, look no further</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">I read the book in middle school and watched
  the movie shortly afterwards. A few of the characters were
  switched around, but I was so impressed with the adaptation. A
  thriller that still makes me nervous and jumpy - the kids in the
  kitchen scene and when Mr. Arnold's arm drops on Ellie's shoulder
  as she's trying to turn the generator back on, for example. There
  have been countless lines I've memorized and quoted at
  appropriate and innapropriate times, due to my obsession. And
  after watching it more than 25 times, I've come to appreciate it
  more. Great cast - Sam Neil is my favorite. Richard Attenborough
  is a little too cute and nice, but I liked his white clothing,
  the hat, and the amber cane. Wayne Knight was incredible as
  Nedry, the slob. He's as likeable as ever, though somewhat the
  villain. I always hate it when he dies. Jeff Goldblum fit the
  description of Ian Malcom from Crichton's novel well. Crichton
  sparked my interest in Chaos Theory, sometimes called The
  Butterfly Effect. I am a firm believer in it. And of course, in
  the novel and film, Malcolm was right. "Life finds a way..." (In
  Chaos Theory, the system is very sensitive to small changes in
  external conditions, and "random" --unpredictable-- events result
  from the "normal" equation/setup, because there is never a fixed
  set of outcomes; the system is unpredictable because of its
  complexity. Hammond thought his system was without error, that he
  was in complete control. He believed that the dinosaurs would
  fail to reproduce because all were engineered to be female, but
  he was wrong - the dinosaurs evolved because of the replacement
  amphibian DNA that was used to fill in the gaps in the dinosaur
  DNA. This DNA gave the dinosaurs the ability to change sex in
  order to reproduce, "survive," in a single-sex environment. And
  it turned out that Hammond was wrong about many other equations -
  things are not as black and white as he thought, and it is
  problematic to predict long-term behavior of his animals.) Love
  the scene where the lawyer is eaten while sitting on the toilet.
  We watched the Mr. DNA segment in a high school biology class.
  I've always thought it explained the process very well for
  something that is complicated (though I found Mr. Hammond's live
  speaking lines to be unrealistic...was he really planning to be
  there for each tour?). The kids were kind of annoying. I didn't
  notice this until I was a little older, but Lex ("I prefer to be
  called a hacker") uses Silicon Graphics' 3D file system navigator
  to turn power back on in the park. Their logo is on the monitor.
  If only UNIX were as popular as Windows is now... Anyway, the
  soundtrack was classic - it was the first CD I bought, back in
  the mid-90s. Tonya Harding skated to the theme at the 1994
  Olympics, or some other competition. I only liked her because of
  her excellent music choice</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">The Station Agent is a touching, yet off the
  beaten path kind of flick that I found simply endearing to watch.
  Fin (Peter Dinklage) has just inherited a train depot somewhere
  out in New Jersey. Having a passion for trains, he embraces this
  as his home. However, he only wishes to be left alone and finds
  that's not as easy to do as he would have thought. First, he
  discovers Joe (Bobby Cannavale) who has set up a food truck
  outside his home. Joe is a conversationalist, desperate to talk
  to anyone and everyone. Next Fin meets Olivia (Patricia
  Clarkson), who almost runs him off the road, twice. These three
  appear to have nothing in common, and despite all odds, they form
  a friendship that is heartwarming to see. All three actors gave
  amazing performances. Dinklage, as always, commands every scene
  he is in. I've missed seeing him since the bastards at CBS
  quashed Threshold, so it was nice to see something with him in it
  again. Cannavale amused me with his character, Joe, who really
  needed to "get a life." The idea of quite time is not something
  he can easily grasp to say the least. And Clarkson radiated as
  Olivia, a character trying to put her life back together again
  after having lost her son and having her husband leave her. What
  I liked most about this flick is the honest portrayal it gave us
  of life through Fin's eyes. There were the chronic stares he got
  just for being smaller than average. Plus, there was a scene in
  the grocery store where the cashier didn't even see that he was
  standing there, so she didn't ring him up until he could get her
  attention. It just made me think about what it must really be
  like to not fit in the standard mold physically. All in all,
  excellent film</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">2 Fast 2 Furious is one of those sequels
  that comes around every so often that doesn't require you to have
  seen the original. I saw this movie for the first time not too
  long after it came out, and having never seen the original, I
  thought I would be lost and wouldn't enjoy myself as much as
  other people, but on the contrary - I left the experience much
  happier than when I came in. This film is full of quick
  one-liners that deserve a laugh. The special effects and the car
  races will leave your mouth gaping open. I have heard and read
  that people didn't appreciate this film as much because it seemed
  to focus more on a plot than the first film did rather than focus
  more on the races, but overall, I think the balance works well.
  Even thinking of the plot that we are left with, I really can't
  see another time when a race would even be appropriate. And as
  for people saying that this film is worse than the original, I
  would have to disagree...Why? Frankly, I have always been a firm
  believer than Vin Diesel is entirely overrated as an actor. (I
  mean, c'mon - Have you seen the Pacifier?) He's nothing more than
  a meat head who, while able to do pretty good fight scenes,
  should leave the dialogue to someone else. Yes, this film is for
  the younger crowd, and there are numerous occasions when
  unbelievable events take place (take the boat jumping as an
  example), but there is no saying that an older person wouldn't
  enjoy it as well...The only thing that I will say is that you
  really shouldn't go into this film expecting an Oscar worthy
  performance, or else you will be disappointed. If you sit back
  and take this as the fun romp that it is, however, you will
  thoroughly enjoy yourself</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">****THIS COMMENT MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS!***
  Anyone who saw this growing up has a soft spot in their hearts
  for it; I've encountered enough people over the course of my 37
  yrs who perk up at the mention of it to be aware of its place in
  a lot of our memories. This has been satirized on the Simpsons,
  which proves it has embedded itself in the national pop culture
  consciousness. Anyone who has read the book its based on, the
  incredible "I am Legend" by Richard Matheson, knows that this
  film has very little in common with it beyond its intial
  premise--and even that is not followed too closely. All of the
  criticisms of THE OMEGA MAN are valid: It is very dated and not
  at all scary or intense and some of the stunts and special
  effects are laughably, ludicrously cheesy; the villains--who
  should have been more terrifying than even Romero's zombies--are
  just crazed albino hippie Luddites and the last half of the film,
  once Chuck hooks up with Rosalind Cash and the kiddies, is really
  a let down. But the scenes that open the film of Heston hefting a
  cool-looking machine gun while decked out in Austin Powers-style
  finery (!) staring in angst at an old calendar or losing his mind
  for a moment hallucinating the sound of telephones ringing in the
  deserted city still pack a punch. This was the second movie,
  after 1959's THE WORLD,THE FLESH, AND THE DEVIL, to successfully
  pull off the eerie effect of being the last living human being in
  a huge empty city. Both films established the visual motif of
  streets filled with blowing waves of newspapers and swirling
  trash.After years of seeing this on tv -- a guaranteed late
  September or early October event every year for a few years on
  the local tv station during my Pacific Northwest childhood in the
  old dark ages before CABLE TV and the videocassette revolution,
  its nice to see this movie on DVD with a beautiful widescreen
  transfer. It looks and sounds great. As a child I always liked
  the music, particularly the "surprise party" theme that plays
  when the villains make thir first appearance. It rocks here in
  all its xylophone and funky electric organ and horns glory</Text>

  <Text category="dvd">The Chronological Donald Vol.2 was the
  second box of my collection, after I happen collected the first
  one. The tin box contains 2 DVD9 look very precious.But the

  <Text category="dvd">saw the trailer online and knew I'd love it
  on dvd I was right laughed my ass off 8 times after watching it
  so many times of the 8 times I watched it that is it is sad
  Tucker couldn't be in this one and last Friday movie but it's
  still great the new cast members add more humor just as much the
  ones in the second and first Friday movies the plot is deeper
  more twisted more funny more senseless especially with Day Day i
  laughed so hard the extras are worth it Cube is great at making
  films so no one slam him he is an amazing film maker considering
  he used to star in movies when he can star in one and create it
  that's more then genious that's innovative he does good at
  starring and making movies give him props people and you can't

  <Text category="dvd">Season 3 of The L-Word is by far the best
  yet. The character development and story have come so far since
  the 1st season, and are even better than season 2. They have
  scaled back the sex a little bit, but when they do put it in, the
  sparks really fly. I love the l-word</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">A terrific documentary. Even if you have
  seen it on PBS, you need the dvd to view the great extra
  material</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">Spurlock decided to undertake an interesting
  experiment with his own health; eat nothing but McDonald's fast
  food for 30 days. The result; his health gets ruined. While
  Spurlock's experience is not exactly a scientific study you could
  publish in the Lancet, it is a disturbing examination of what
  fast food and soft drink are doing to our health. I rarely eat
  McDonalds (though I enjoy the odd coke) however the restaurant
  chain is quite popular in Australia, as it is worldwide. The
  strength of Mcdonalds and other fast food chains is obviously
  providing tasty food at low prices very quickly to the consumer.
  McDonalds essentially applied the industrial technique of mass
  production to fast food, and made Ray Kroc (its founder) a
  fortune. I don't really buy the line that multinational
  corporations are evil, because they are multinational
  corporations; we have to remember corporations exist in relation
  to governments and ultimately consumers, as well as shareholders.
  We happily buy coke, McDonalds, cigarettes, and many other things
  obviously bad for our health, and yet seem to like to blame the
  company which provides that addictive substance to us when our
  health goes bad. In our individualistic culture, we tend to all
  too readily avoid self-responsibility and the virtue of
  self-control, and in my view this is part of the reason fast food
  exists. However, the rocketing levels of obesity, especially
  amoung children, are of great concern, and it is clear the
  marketing techniques often aimed at children by fast food
  companies is at least unethical. We need to make sure the tide of
  obesity turns in the negative direction, otherwise this
  generation risks dying earlier than our parents and grandparents.
  Spurlock's experience is a warning to all of us to take the
  warnings on eating well and exercising seriously, and not
  ignoring them for the sake of self-indulgence</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">Brando can sing!! Guys and Dolls is proof.
  One of the all time great musicals and the biggest box office hit
  of 1955, has Brando as the main lead and he is ably supported by
  THE VOICE - Sinatra. Now only a mad man will say that Brando is a
  better singer than Sinatra, but to give Brando his due he sang
  well and carried of the role brilliantly...like wise only a mad
  man will say Sinatra is a better actor than Brando. Guys and
  Dolls is a very important film in Brando's career. It is the
  first light hearted movie he made. All his movies before this
  were heavy dramatic stuff. This is the first movie where Brando
  is having fun and what fun it was. Great songs, great acting and
  great stars...GUYS and DOLLS is 4 star entertainment all the way.
  Brando and Simmons along with Sinatra and Blaine are
  amazing.</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">I really liked this film. Before Michael
  Moore became a liberal celebrity, he was a completely obscure
  magazine writer and filmmaker. This film was a major underground
  hit at the time, and it still is excellent today. You really feel
  for the people who lose their jobs, and you're infuriated by the
  callous indifference of Roger Smith and the management of General
  Motors. I really liked the segment where Flint tries to reinvent
  itself as tourist mecca of the Midwest. It consisted of a
  horribly misguided attempt at opening up a Hilton in downtown
  Flint, and opening up a theme park called Auto World. It justs
  smacks of desperation and stupidity; it has make you laugh and
  grimace at the same time. Instead of giving these people really
  good jobs again, they come up with this idiotic scheme, which
  ended up in disaster (both the Hilton and Auto World closed
  within a year). Moore in recent years has become a "political
  celebrity", in that politics has become quite the cottage
  industry in America. It's not just Moore doing it; right wingers
  like Hannity and Coulter have been doing it too. They all got
  books; some of them got films; some of them have radio shows. A
  lot of them aren't really interested in changing anything, as it
  might interfere with their livelihoods. I don't know if Moore is
  like that or not. But this is still a potent, darkly funny film
  about real class warfare, and the dismantling of the working
  class in America.</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">I actually didn't mind Kiss The Girls
  because of Morgan Freeman. He saved the day in that movie. Plus,
  I'm always intrigued by serial killers and weird psychos. That
  always peaks my interest. But Ashley Judd's performance was just
  terrible in that (not that I think she's very good in anything
  I've seen but whatever). That's why I was delighted to find
  another thriller along those lines with Morgan Freeman, still
  playing Alex Cross, but thankfully without Ashely Judd (a better
  name for her would be Ashely Dudd but that's my opinion). Along
  Came A Spider was not only an interesting storyline, it was also
  very well acted. There's some twists of course which I won't
  spoil, but one I did see coming and the other blindsided me. All
  in all very enjoyable, especially for the low price I found this
  at. The little girl who is kidnapped in this, played by Mika
  Boorem, is terrific. It was kind of neat seeing her in this as I
  had just watched the movie Sleepover recently (also reviewed
  it...cute little movie...check it out) where she's more grown up.
  Hopefully we'll be seeing more things with her. Anyway, I found
  this engrossing enough and most times you can't go wrong with
  Morgan Freeman (except if Ashely Judd is in a scene with him, but
  that's not his fault) as he's an exceptional actor. Obsessed with
  serial killers, psychos and the like, just as I am? Then you will
  have a good time getting tangled up in the web of Along Came A
  Spider</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">A film that's a little like trying to find
  your way out of a house of mirrors or an attempt to reassemble an
  image once it has been split by a prism. Since nothing is as it
  seems, we may as well be inside a fictionalized world; like the
  Unicorn story the main character, Cathryn, is writing. This
  fantasy is read aloud throughout the film creating a framework
  whose only relevance to the story unfolding, is to reassure us
  that we have stepped into a world that is a creation of the
  imagination; however, the fact that is comes from the mind of a
  schizophrenic is hardly reassuring. A glance at the cast of
  characters hints that they are not necessarily who or what they
  seem (Hugh is played by Rene, Rene is played by Marcel who is
  played by Hugh. Cathryn is played by Susannah and Susannah plays
  Cathryn). Insanity is not an ordering principle of the mind, but
  rather a vain attempt to put order to an ever-changing palette of
  images that may or may not be reflections of images within the
  mind instead of outside. A very atmospheric film made more so by
  the disturbing score that is not altogether in sync with the
  action, another technique that constantly keeps the viewer off
  balance</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">Excelente concierto en el castillo Slane en

  <Text category="dvd">I enjoy all three of the the Jurassic Park
  movies, though I think &amp;amp;quot;The Lost World&amp;amp;quot;
  is a bit weak. While I think that anyone who enjoys action
  movies, monster movies, or horror movies should own all three, I
  find it difficult to recommend this set because there is a set
  that contains not only the three movies, but a fourth DVD
  containing substantial background information on the making of
  the movies. I give this collection four stars only because the
  larger, more comprehensive collection is available and if you
  liked the first two, you will definitely like the third
  movie</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">This is a great movie that everyone should
  see. I'm a Conservative and so are all of my friends and they
  love this movie. We don't see this movies as a "Republicans are
  Bad movie" thats dumb. This movie is just what a movie should be,
  funny and entertaining. We all LOVE the songs because they are
  not only great, but true too</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">I can't wait to see the original film again.
  I remember seeing the lemmings plunging into the sea. Thus was
  born the inspiration for the great PC game, Lemmings. Yes, I know
  that the lemmings were 'manipulated' into suicide. Nevertheless I
  love this movie. I hope that they don't cut the lemming sequence.
  Disney has promised a full restoration. Other animals that left a
  strong impression on me were the musk oxen in a circle being
  blasted with an Arctic blizzard. The hardships of an Arctic
  existence were beautifully photographed</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">This is a great show and very entertaining.
  The story isn't the Greek classic, but it's a fine riff on it.
  The songs are good, and they grow on you as you watch. I take
  issue with the reviewer who thought there was gratuitous
  sexuality in the Meg character - it's just a cartoon, for pete's
  sake. Like some other reviewers, I was also annoyed with Michael
  Bolton singing "Go The Distance" over the end credits, but this
  DVD has a music video of the Spanish language version, "No
  Importa La Distancia," sung by Ricky Martin, and it is killer!
  This one is well worth the money</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">The direction of this film is excellent. I
  love all the characters and the way they interact. The storyline
  is very important also. It's about religious beliefs and
  neighbors that interact with each other. It's a well-paced and
  interesting story that's not like anything else I've ever
  seen.</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">SCRUBS has been a model of consistency in
  its five seasons--and to interrupt myself, why aren't we
  anticipating Season Five instead of Season Four? And boo! on them
  for being so slow to bring the show out on DVD!--and Season Four
  is no exception. I recently rewatched Seasons 1 through 3 on DVD
  with my daughter and it really brought home just how great this
  series has been from the very beginning to the present. If you
  visit boards there are always prognosticators who declare that it
  isn't as good as it used to be, but I would be dishonest if I
  said that I detected any decline. One thing I've really enjoyed
  is that unlike situation comedies, this one really does have an
  overall story arc, and I really appreciate Bill Lawrence and Co.
  taking the time to reward fans of the show in this way. The story
  in Season Four revolves largely around the very, very gradual
  repair of the friendship between JD and Elliott. Fans of the show
  know that at the end of Season Three JD, utterly smitten by
  Elliott, had expressed his love for her, causing her to break off
  her relationship with her boyfriend to be with JD. No sooner had
  he done this, however, he once again felt trapped and almost
  immediately broke things off with her. Season Four opens with her
  filled with hatred of him, complicated by the fact that she and
  he are named co-chief residents (though there is wonderful
  confusion over the fact that the name plate on her door
  reads--thanks to Janitor--"Chief Resident" and his misleadingly
  reads "Co-Chief Resident," causing many to imagine that she is
  over him). Some of my favorite visuals in the series are of JD
  and Elliott wedged into their ultra tiny office, barely large
  enough for the desk they face each other across. Of course,
  eventually they patch things up, but for the first season have no
  kind of romantic entanglement. Given the intensity of the events
  of the ends of Season Three, any sort of getting together would
  certainly have ended with Elliott murdering JD. The season ends
  with Carla and Turk urging JD to move out and get a place of his
  own, which leads to an interesting roommate situation in Season
  Five. Season Four continued the SCRUBS tradition of having some
  very high profile guest stars. This was marred somewhat by having
  the absolutely dreadful Colin Farrell on one episode, an episode
  through which he drifted as if completely drunk or totally bored
  (there have been very few bad episodes of SCRUBS, but this
  episode ranks near the bottom). The always delightful Heather
  Graham sparkled through several episodes earlier in the season.
  Matthew Perry stopped by for an episode less interesting for his
  presence than for his being teamed with his father, Jonathan
  Bennett Perry, a country singer best known to most people as the
  Old Spice sailor. Tara Reid puts in another appearance as JD's
  terrible sometimes girlfriend while Molly Shannon is in another
  episode. And Julianna Margulies of ER appears in a couple of
  episodes. The great tragedy with SCRUBS is that it remains
  something of a secret. The only comedy better than SCRUBS in the
  past few years has been ARRESTED DEVELOPMENT (most fans of one
  show tend to be a fan of the other as well, and the lead of each
  show appeared on the other, Zach Braff as the producer of the
  GIRLS WITH LOW SELF-ESTEEM series of videos on AR and Jason
  Bateman as a patient on SCRUBS) and while it won a large number
  of awards, its ratings were worse than SCRUBS. This show has
  decent ratings, but shockingly few awards. How terrible shows
  like EVERYBODY LOVES RAYMOND and the formerly good but now dull
  WILL AND GRACE beat it out for awards is mystifying. And how did
  it manage only one Emmy nomination? It was nominated for Best
  Comedy Series, but why wasn't Zach Braff nominated for Best Comic
  Actor and John C. McGinley and Donald Faison for Best Supporting
  Actor in a Comedy Series and Sarah Chalke for Best Supporting
  Actress in a Comedy Series? How is that possible? Much ink has
  been spilt on how the 2006 Emmy nominations have made less sense
  than any in memory (Lauren Graham yet again not nominated, though
  clearly the best comic actress on TV for at least five years and
  five vastly less talented women were nominated instead of her;
  LOST not nominated; no nominations for VERONICA MARS; Jason Lee
  not nominated for MY NAME IS EARL; neither Michael Chiklis, Hugh
  Laurie, nor James Gandolofini nominated for Best Actor, while
  Martin Sheen who was barely appeared in this year's WEST WING;
  while shows way, way, way, way past their prime like WILL AND
  GRACE and THE WEST WING nominated; and the list goes on) but Zach
  Braff's failure to be nominated while Charlie Sheen and Kevin
  James did is just one more reason not to take the Emmys seriously
  at all. At least the Golden Globes more or else get it right.
  Anyway, awards aside, and armed with the knowledge that the best
  shows are usually neglected by the Emmys (how many Emmy nods did
  BUFFY get despite most of the nation's best TV critics
  passionately begging each year for it to get the recognition it
  deserved), fans of the show will be delighted with Season Four
  and if you aren't a fan, you should be. But don't start with
  Season Four. Go back and do it right. Either buy or rent (I
  recommend buying--you'll want to watch this more than once)
  Season One, then work your way forward. Many pleasurable hours
  will result</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">I recently had a baby boy, and felt a
  &amp;amp;quot;little&amp;amp;quot; out of shape after having
  him(HA!)I did a search on amazon and found this video. I got it
  in 3 days, and began right away. My son works out with me every
  day, and I couldn't be happier! We both have fun doing the
  exercises which work my whole body, and I use him for the
  weights!I am also learning about my baby's development from the
  video. It's educational and rewarding. Thanks MBBB</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">This movie is pure fun. My whole family
  loved it. It's corny and the acting leaves you feeling like it's
  amatuer hour, but its fun to watch. We made popcorn and laughed
  our way through the whole thing. Watch it and enjoy</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">I really liked this product. Easy to follow
  and you feel it everywhere. I try to do it everyday. My clothes
  are looking better on me and I have had to buy some new ones. One
  of the best choices I ever made</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">This movie is possibly one of the best
  movies I have ever seen. Christopher Nolan is a genius along with
  all of his other movies. This movie is very unique and will never
  get old</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">Finally, an ab video that makes sense and
  works. This video is truly innovative and unique. Imagine having
  rock hard abs and great core strength without doing a sit up or a
  crunch. You have to see it to believe it! Mike Griffith makes
  this video fun, easy to follow, and very challenging for the
  beginner or most conditioned athlete. With a short amount of time
  and minimal equipment, this program will stretch and strenghten
  your abs in a functional way. I am a physical therapist and I use
  these techniques for patients with back pain as well as for
  performance improvement for athletes. I have been using it
  myself, and it works</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">I really enjoyed this DVD-and all of the
  combos were doable with great breakdowns. The instructor actually
  starts with the left foot , so you can follow her mirror image. I
  teach dance and will definately use a lot of these moves. And,
  you will work up a sweat, if you want more just do jumping jacks
  or run when they march. Enjoy</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">Following the series of Firefly, Serenity
  continues the story line for a few more steps. There are so many
  ways this movie is packed I cannot begin to properly mention them
  here. The storyline is woven to present images not so much out of
  sequence but in a "solving the mystery" approach. The english
  language used presents a plausible development that on first
  viewing is not difficult to follow or understand- mostly through
  common word usage that is more and more endearing with subsequent
  viewing. The animations are first rate and contribute to an
  unbelievably real quality. The characters are complex, focused,
  solid and believable from the way they are unchanging in their
  demeanor in all situations. The challenges the crew of Serenity
  face are many: from their interactions with unsavory underworld
  bosses while earning money for survival to avoiding authority
  "Alliance" forces to the overt mortal threat of the "Reavers".
  The climax builds to the end revealing some things while setting
  the stage for the story to continue. The music in Serenity
  contributes to the experience leaving me wanting more. I suggest
  seeing the series Firefly before watching the movie Serenity to
  fully understand and grasp the nuances of the characters</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">My wife and I, huge fans of `America's Next
  Top Model' and `Project Runway', were very excited about seeing
  this film. Why it took us this long still baffles me, but as of
  Friday night we had the pleasure of seeing `The Devil Wears
  Prada' and let me just say that it was quite the pleasure. Now,
  most if not all the praise has been heaped on the shoulders of
  Meryl Streep, and while she was outstanding, this film is more
  than just a Meryl painted canvas. There are four brilliant
  performances in this film and they all are deserving of praise.
  First is Anne Hathaway who plays Andrea Sachs, a young aspiring
  journalist who takes a job working as Miranda Priestly assistant
  at `Runway Magazine'. Anne Hathaway proves with her performance
  that she's all grown up. No, that's not to take away from her
  more adult roles in more adult films like `Havoc' and the
  masterpiece `Brokeback Mountain', but here Anne proves that she
  can do adult comedy, not falling back into her teen goofiness
  that made her famous in `The Princess Diaries' but keeping
  everything smart and mature. She has enough poise and grace to
  match wits with Miranda, and she does so elegantly. Next up is
  Emily Blunt who plays Emily, Miranda's first assistant (there are
  two, Andrea being the second). Emily has worked her butt off to
  get to where she is, slaving for the unruly Priestly and it's all
  about to pay off with a trip alongside Miranda to Paris. The only
  thing standing in her way is Andrea, for if Andrea fails
  miserably then it reflects poorly on Emily. Emily Blunt turns out
  I think the best performance of the bunch for she has enough
  sass, enough attitude and enough wit to make her pop out from the
  screen and stand out no matter who is sharing the screen with
  her. Stanley Tucci also does wonderfully here as Nigel, Miranda's
  second in command. He is there to make sure everything is
  perfect, and also help Andrea adjust. Stanley always has done
  great backup work, playing second hand man to just about
  everyone, but here he really makes his performance his own and
  owns it. He delivers some of the funniest lines in the film but
  he never feels like the `token gay guy'...he's needed in this
  film, not filler, and he commands his scenes and really stands
  out amidst the crowd. And then, of course, we have Meryl Streep
  who plays the ruthless tyrant known as Miranda Priestly. What I
  was most impressed about was the way Meryl underplays every word,
  every emotion, every scene, which is not what I expected. I
  really expected her to go all Glen Close and reincarnate Cruella
  but she didn't (thankfully) and instead turned out one of the
  most inspired performances of the year. She must have had fun
  playing the snooty self absorbed and above all selfish
  editor-in-chief of `Runway'. She lets us see inside her character
  briefly (when crying over another failed marriage) but her
  character is more about shutting off feeling in order to succeed
  and so we don't get to see the real Miranda because we're not
  supposed to. Carried by these four brilliant performances `The
  Devil Wears Prada' is a fabulous film that will make you laugh
  and make you smile and will impress almost anyone. The script is
  brilliantly adapted from Lauren Weisberger's novel, and while
  it's not an exact replica (are any adaptations these days?) it
  carries the same wit but smoothes things out to make it more
  approachable and, in my eyes, more enjoyable. Bravo</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">I've been doing this DVD workout for two
  years, and I still can't make it all the way through the "level
  2" workouts. This video is incredibly challenging, but I like
  that I can do the "level 1" workouts and have the goal of making
  it to the next level one day. No other DVD can accomplish what
  Tamilee does in 15 minutes. This really makes me value how
  efficient she is at giving you exercises that are really
  challenging and in a short amount of time. I am always sore the
  next day when I do her workouts. This is a great DVD</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">A hardcore legend in Mick Foley' wrestling
  career is spotlighted here on this DVD. Foley will go down in
  history for being able to control the crowd, being violent
  &amp;amp; hardcore, and also being able to be one of the most
  loveable characters in wrestling. This DVD is a great collection
  of violent matches involing Foley himself along with his famous
  promos &amp;amp; extra matches. Disc One: Cactus Jack vs. Big Van
  Vader - During a time where Vader was just killing his opponetts,
  Cactus Jack was able to hold his own and go toe to toe with
  Vader. This also includes exclusive footage that was censored on
  TBS. Chicago Street Fight: Cactus Jack &amp;amp; Maxx Payne vs.
  Nasty Boys - This was one of the "stiffest" matches I've ever
  seen as these guys were legitlity brawling &amp;amp; hitting each
  other with the weapons and you just see at one point Cactus get
  his head cracked with a shovel on the floor. Honestly, one of the
  best Nasty Boys matches I've seen. Cactus Jack vs. Sabu - This
  match was more about the post match brawl between the two than
  the match itself. Foley admits before the match that the hype
  &amp;amp; reputation between these two set a standard that nobody
  could match. Cactus Jack vs. Chris Candido - One of Cactus's best
  "wrestling" matches eventhough it's not really anything
  memorable. Texas Death Match: Cactus Jack vs. The Sandman - Foley
  openily admits that this match wasn't pretty as Sandman got a
  concussion at the beginning &amp;amp; really threw everything
  off. They would go on to have better matches (as seen on the ECW
  Cactus Jack DVD). Cactus Jack &amp;amp; Raven vs. Terry Funk
  &amp;amp; Tommy Dreamer - The classic ECW wild weapons brawl as
  they had everything including the kitchen sink. It would get sick
  as you see things like Cactus sliceing Funk's arm with glass.
  With cameo's from Taz &amp;amp; Bill Alfonzo, this is worth
  watching again &amp;amp; again. Cactus Jack vs. Mikey Whipwreck -
  Cactus' last match in ECW against the man he helped make a
  superstar. Disc 1 Extras: Post-Vader match interview - Interview
  a week after his match with Vader Falls Count Anywhere: Cactus
  Jack vs. Sting - This match has commentary from Coach &amp;amp;
  Foley where they talked about his storytelling throughout the
  match &amp;amp; his time in WCW. This was Cactus' best WCW match
  in his opinion and it really is. Action all over the ringside
  area along with great inring storytellin (watch him work on
  Sting's ribs). Cactus Jack spits on WCW Tag Team Championship
  belt - The promo Cactus did after this Sabu match showing that
  the WCW Tag Title didn't mean as much as his pride that he lost
  to Sabu. This is followed by a Heyman promo regarding that match.
  The "Cane Dewey" Promo - Foley's favorite promo done during this
  "anti-hardcore" stint in ECW where he talks about the fans making
  a sign suggesting that Sandman canes his 5 year old son.
  "Anti-Hardcore" promo - Another promo where Foley talks down to
  the ECW fans for being so bloodthirsty. Cactus Jack vs. Sabu -
  The Cactus/Sabu rematch that includes commentary from Foley
  &amp;amp; Coach. This match is better quality (both in video
  &amp;amp; in ring action) than the previous one. Mick Foley's ECW
  Farewell Speech - Foley says goodbye to the ECW fans. "Jack""
  Foley &amp;amp; Les Thornton vs. British Bulldogs - Mick's WWE
  debut that results in his having a dislocated jaw thanks to the
  Dynamite Kid. WWE Confidential feature - Mick talks about all the
  charity work he did during his 18 month absence in WWE and what
  led to his coming back to WWE. Hidden Easter Eggs: Mick Foley
  jumps off the roof of his house (On disc one, go to the "Extras"
  menu, highlight "Main Menu" and press the left arrow twice.) Dude
  Love Entrance Video (On disc one, go to the "Chapters" menu.
  Highlight "Cactus Jack vs. Chris Candido" and press the right
  arrow.) Disc 2 Introducting Mankind - One of the Mankind
  "dungeon" promos he did before his debut Mankind vs. Shawn
  Michaels - This was Foley's best match of his career and probably
  the best match of 1996. HBK's high flyin' lucha libre influenced
  style mixed with Mankind's hardcore daredevil style made for one
  hell of a match. Falls Count Anywhere: Cactus Jack vs. Triple H -
  Tables, trash cans, and weapons galore in this brawl. One of the
  best matches in RAW history Mick Foley vs. Terry Funk - A
  throwback to their ECW brawls as both of these wrestlers are just
  using their own bodies are wrecking machines. Stone Cold on
  commentary just adds to the craziness of this match. Dude Love
  vs. Stone Cold - The best match in the history of Dude Love as
  it's another brawl all over ringside. McMahon, Brisco, Patterson,

  <Text category="dvd">This is my favorite movie. I like it all:
  screenplay, director, actors, etc. Believe it brilliant</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">I just can't say enough good things about
  the Brainy Baby series of videos and toys. I have allowed my baby
  to watch one Brainy Baby video per day since he was about 6
  months old. He loves them. And I love being able to have a few
  minutes to clean my kitchen. :) As soon as the Brainy Baby theme
  music comes on he starts to smile. He is captivated. I like them
  much more than the Baby Einstein videos. And the toys.......he
  LOVES them. "Hello, Brainy Baby!" They are the most loved and
  most used toys in his toy box. I have to keep an extra stash of
  batteries just to make sure that they are all working all the
  time. We love Brainy Baby at our house.</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">Wow, I just viewed "Spun" the other night
  and I thought this movie was outrageous. This is sort of a
  guilt-pleasure movie but you want to take shower afterwards.
  "Spun" has an impressive cast of recognized actors. The film is,
  essentially, about a few days in the lives of a group of drug
  addicts. There is The Cook (Mickey Rourke, he truly makes this
  story worth watching), who makes the drug (speed) and sells it to
  Spider Mike (John Leguizamo), a dealer with a junkie girlfriend,
  Cookie (Mena Suvari, looking infinitely less attractive than she
  did in "American Beauty"). One of his clients is Ross (Jason
  Schwartzman), who does a lot of favours for The Cook and his
  girlfriend, Nikki (Brittany Murphy). I was surprised at how funny
  the film was at times. It doesn't drown us in anti-drug messages,
  nor does it become one of those, equally tedious, drug films
  where you feel like the sober driver at a drunken party. The
  humour is dark, certainly, but funny nevertheless. A lot of it
  comes from a subplot about Frisbee, Patrick Fugit, who is caught
  by a couple of TV policemen (Peter Stormare and Alexis Arquette)
  and is told he will be let off if he helps them get Spider-Mike.
  I will only say of the resulting sequence that he does it with
  all the subtlety of an undercover policeman with his badge stuck
  to his forehead. This is a film with a lot of energy, that seems,
  like its characters, not entirely sure where it is going, but
  determined to get there, and quickly. Although I am sure it is
  boring to be surrounded by people on speed when you are sober,
  this film almost makes you feel like you are on speed too. The
  director, Jonas &#239;&#191;&#189;kerlund, has directed music
  videos in the past, and it shows in his impatient filming style,
  as he plays around with animation, speeded-up camerawork and such
  like. I'm not recommending the film for its style though,
  although I am sure it is the best way this material could get to
  the screen. I am recommending it because I liked the main
  characters, which I think will stick in my head for much longer
  than the animated sex scenes or the split screens. I can imagine
  an entire film about The Cook and Nikki, or Spider Mike and
  Cookie, or even just Ross, who absentmindedly keeps leaving a
  girl handcuffed to his bed for hours/days. What makes "Spun"
  better than those hypothetical films is that it puts the
  characters into their own little community, and we feel as if we
  are watching their everyday, speeded up, sleepless lives. Simply
  amazing.</Text>

  <Text category="dvd">Francis Ford Coppola's Apocalypse Now is a
  pure example of method filmmaking. It is the true craftmanship of
  an essential filmmaker. The art direction, editing and sound
  effects are partially a small fragment which makes this film
  classical and memorable. What drives the integrity and semblance
  of the film is the storyline, acting and inner message. The inner
  message evidently enough is that war is hell, or in other words,
  hell is war. Not many directors have the ambition or the true
  courage to establish such a well-defined piece of art. European
  filmmakers wouldn't have the slightest problem of directing the
  film or throw in their personal feelings about the war. What is
  most interesting is that an American filmmaker spoke his style
  and the style of the film's collaborators through the continuance
  of the film. The plot is fairly simple and brief, adapted by
  Joseph Conrad's Heart Of Darkness. Martin Sheen plays the role of
  Captain Willard, a war-torn character who does not see any hope
  in life or humanity anymore. He has a mission and it is to
  capture a presumed Colonel Kurtz (Marlon Brando) who has
  fabricated an army of existensial soldiers on the outskirts of
  the Cambodian jungle. Throughout the film we encounter
  astonishing sequences. The most unforgettable is the dawn
  helicopter attacks. Robert Duvall's character Colonel Kilgore is
  a steady and firm example of the basic American army brain: to
  search and destroy and then destroy some more if it includes
  yourself. The children walk about the playground, oblivious to
  any danger. The helicopters come into view from the dawning sea;
  millions of sprinkle reflect from the water, we hear the
  helicopter's engines roar from the horizon and soon enough we are
  stuck in a messy attack. Throughout the sequence we hear Wagner's
  'Ride Of The Valkyries'. It is method filmmaking. The starting
  sequence is as fascinating as the rest of the movie; a beautiful
  scene of palm trees blowing in the ragged wind and seconds away
  from being inflamed with a carpet bombing. Let's not forget the
  scene where the soldiers of the boat in which Sheen travels in,
  stop an innocent upcoming boat, suspecting them to be VietCongs
  and carrying artilleries. Then they spark off a heavy scene of
  shooting in which all of the passengers of the boat are
  pulverised to pieces with their crops and food savaged in the
  atrocity. This film has its famous moment, some better to be kept
  quiet about until they come through the screen. It doesn't
  require any intellectual understanding, although the film is
  intellectually remarkable. The American soldiers in the Vietnam
  War jumped into the land of a fresh governmental country, aiming
  to protect themselves and in the end only received death and
  chaos for their troops and for the majority of the country they
  were fighting against. It was a war gone mad, like all other
  wars, without purpose or dignity. It was a pure act of humanity:
  to destroy and restore their own greedy needs. This is a film in
  which there is no saviour, where it is hardly possible to find
  hope in the gloomiest corners and where all surroundings are
  plagued with the infatuations of greed, anger, foolishness and
  egoism. As Coppola once said about the film: 'This film isn't
  about Vietnam. This film IS Vietnam'. He was right to the date.
  During the current situations of the world, where they are trying
  to protect their own skin, the world should try to analyse this
  film as much as possible and wonder about what it is trying to
  represent. It is a film which does not ask for applause or
  damnation. It asks for realism. Enjoy</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">I watched this dvd in one of my classes and
  it left me feeling hoplessly hopeless! I really dont know what to
  think about the whole presentation. The presence of Chomsky makes
  it look reputable but who knows, he might have been taken out of
  context although it seemed not. If what they claim about
  corporations is true, then we are getting ready to implode in one
  way or another.I'll keep away from political lines and just
  suggest that you watch it and decide... I had given it a rating
  of 3 but just changed it to 4. The material is more plausible
  than otherwise</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">I love this film, beautifully simple and
  human. The characters are real; flawed yet somehow you find
  sympathy for them- just like your own family. I've rented at
  least fifteen times, and I never get bored of it. It's great any
  time of year, but fantastic for the holidays</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">It's not a conflict of good and evil that
  drives MILLIONS (Fox), but rather issues of what's right and
  wrong. Set in the UK, this exquisite family film about two
  brothers, serious seven year old Damien and fun-loving nine year
  Anthony, who recently lost their mom and discover a suitcase full
  of British Pounds has dropped out of the sky and crashed into
  their playhouse. And it's only seven days before the official
  currency switches to Euros. The brothers think it came from God
  and they have differing agendas: Spend it on themselves or give
  it to the needy. But the money, on a train to incinerators, was
  tossed by crooks to accomplices and they want the missing bag
  back. Millions is funny, scary and profound. You may even
  discover things about yourself you never before considered.
  Rated: PG. Genre: Family Drama/Comedy. 1 Hour, 38 Minutes.
  Starring: James Nesbitt, Daisy Donovan, Alex Etel, Lewis
  McGibbon. Director: Danny Boyle.</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">This is a teen movie with the endless teen
  theme of boy seeking to get the goodies from the girl. It is
  better than the average for this genre due to several factors.
  Mostly, it is because is well done. The subject matter lends
  itself to course treatment but that is not what is presented
  here. Instead, the situations are depicted with as much dignity
  as possible from hormone driven teenagers and is is presented
  with comedy. The time of the film is the 50s. Society was more
  innocent back then but boys still had the same thing on their
  minds that they always have and always will. In this case, the
  school geek has a bad case for the school beauty queen. He is
  aided in his quest by the cool loner from out of town who has his
  own heart set on "the nice girl". Meanwhile, the unpopular girl
  has a bad case herself for the geek. The geek achieves his goal
  and learns that the decorative aspects of women sometimes cover
  up the less desirable traits. The loner finds that the nice girl
  really is a nice girl and that love is something special. The
  unpopular girl undergoes a hormone miracle and becomes a prize
  catch. Everyone winds up happy except the town bully/rich boy. It
  is simplistic in its portrayal but no less appealing for that.
  Kelly Preston plays the beauty queen and she really is the stuff
  of dreams until the wrapper comes off. Doug McKeon plays the geek
  who becomes a prize himself. Catherine Mary Stewart is the nice
  girl that I wish had lived next door to me and Jami Gertz is the
  metamorphosed hormone miracle. The cast is rounded out by Chris
  Nash. Each does a good job in the role. Teen angst comes to the
  fore and a worthwhile story actually results. It was fun and
  bittersweet in the memories it conjured.</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">If your a Pacino fan this is for you one of
  his earlier films This deals with a lawyer not a crooked lawyer
  but a good mostly honest lawyer and all the things that a lawyer
  has goon through or could go through this is a instant classic
  and the story to the movie is excellent Highly recomende</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">I have always like Stephen Lynch. His video
  "Live at the ElRay" was absolutely awesome. I even gave one to my
  cousin this Christmas. Defintely worth the price</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">This has to be the best of the Alien films!
  This film, although not as scary as the original (I mean that it
  did not scare me as much as Alien), it is much more exciting and
  enjoyable than the first. Also, this would have been an ideal
  conclusion to the series. Go on, buy the Collector's Edition of
  the first and this and enjoy</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">I really enjoyed this film, basically the
  Coen Bros. homage to the film noir genre. (I always thought the
  name was funny, since it's French, and yet most of famous
  directors were German, like Fritz Lang, Otto Preminger, etc.
  :-)). The sure hand of the brothers with this material is shown
  in how the film unfolds with the cool, unhurried, nonchalant pace
  of an experienced private eye or gumshoe doggedly stalking his
  prey. Thornton is great in the lead as the reticent, phlegmatic
  barber, and if anything, he is even more convincing with hair
  than without--even his hairpiece is 50s-ish. :-) The whole cast
  does a fine job in their roles, and both Gandolfini and Shaloub
  have a couple of show-stealing scenes. I found the film's climax
  a complete surprise, as the tables turn unexpectedly on the
  barber, for whom everything seems to be working out up till then.
  Overall a great film and probably one of the Coen Bros. best. If
  you're a Coen Bros. fan you won't find this one a
  disappointment.</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">Sorry, after reading some negative reviews I
  just had to speak up. This movie was one of the best movies I
  have ever seen. I still to this day watch it over and over again.
  Well directed, some of the best acting I have seen, and my god
  the cast in this movie, the list of stars is endless. The
  courtroom scenes were so intense, I envey anyone who has not seen
  this yet. The story was perfect and so many surprises and turns.
  Really well done. This movie is worth every penny, I just wish I
  would of got to see it in the movies. It is the most powerful
  movie I have ever seen, how can anyone say this movie was not
  good, I guess they just can't handle the truth..</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">Outstanding! I new a remastered version of
  Ran was a must have, but I did not expect to enjoy Madadayo as
  much as I did. While I agree the packaging does not protect the
  disks well, I got lucky and had no damage. I wonder how they will
  handle this issue if they truly only made 5,000</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">Nowadays, Hollywood just wouldn't have the
  balls to make a film that spits in the face of terrorism, unless
  it was an easy target that doesn't spit back (aka, America and
  it's 1st Amendment). This film harkens back to the day when
  people wished our country's foreign policy was a bit more
  leathery. Well...ya got it now! At the very least, a film like
  this would piss off the surrender-monkeys in the jackass party,
  not only for what they would see as a glorification of
  nationalistic jingoism, but for the villification and slaughter
  of Stalinistic, Castro-like communists that they would only want
  to capitulate and make peace with. Makes one wonder if the lefty
  Glenn Close now hates herself for acting in such a film. What
  would they say to a film like this? Unfortunately, there's plenty
  of room for criticism in this movie, aside from the political
  implications therein. Some (arguably, if not all) of the special
  effects seemed a bit hokey (hence the 4 stars instead of the
  five). I think if anyone wanted to be bipartisan about anything,
  it would have to be the 90's style CGI, especially the plane
  crash. At best, one might go so far as to say it was "cute." And
  what can a guy like me say to that? Even as I write this review,
  scarcely 2 days have past from the red letter day in the struggle
  against terrorism, in which the ruthless terrorist leader of al
  Qaida in Iraq, al-Zarqawi, caught himself a couple of 500 lb.
  bombs with the use of his house. For those who want to keep
  westerners depressed and demoralized (not a far stretch from
  "fear-mongering," right?) in the fight against terrorism, this
  deals a disappointing blow to those who hate America. What's
  worse, they can't seem to ban a film exalting American
  nationalism such as "Air Force One" from those who wish to see it
  (oh no!). And just 2 years ago the same whiners were bitching
  about "The Passion." Sucks to have the 1st amendment apply to
  every American and not just the idealistic "intellectual" few,
  doesn't it</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">Loved this movie when it first came out and
  loved it just as much the this time around. Two of my favorite
  actors depicting a story that love has no boundaries. Very funny
  and moving - yes, I'm a romantic! It's awesome!</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">"Above the Rim" is an entertaining street
  drama that focuses around Kyle Lee Watson, an inner-city high
  school basketball player who shows a lot of promise but lets his
  own arrogance get the best of him. He won't listen to anybody who
  offers him advice on how to improve his game, as he thinks that
  he is the best player ever. He's been hoping that his mad skills
  are catching a college scout's attention, but he does catch
  Birdie's eyes when he plays. Birdie is a well known gang leader
  who offers Kyle the good life so long as he plays on his
  neighborhood team in a "Shoot-Out" basketball contest that means
  the world to him. Kyle--being impatient as ever--agrees to join,
  not seeing the clear danger that is in front of him. A high
  school security guard with a past knows the danger that Birdie
  presents, and he is the only who has a chance to get through to
  Kyle before it is too late. Not only is this a very good
  basketball movie, but it is also an intense and character-driven
  drama centered around the choices that we make in life... and how
  we have to live with them in the long run. The film has some
  great performances from Duane Martin, Marlon Wayans and the late
  Tupac Shakur. Even though everybody is great in their roles, the
  showstopper is indeed Shakur. He gives a very masterful
  performance that really sticks out and will stay with you long
  after the movie is over. My only complaint is the length of the
  movie. It's true that a movie that runs a little over an hour and
  a half isn't short, but I think the story and the characters open
  more possibilities to add on to the movie. I think more
  opportunities and risks could have been taken to further enrich
  the story. Still, it is a really good movie that didn't
  disappoint me. The DVD doesn't have a whole lot to offer. You can
  either watch the movie in widescreen or in fullscreen, depending
  on your preference. The movie looks and sounds very good. The
  only special features that are offered are movie trailers, and
  those aren't even that great. I would've loved it if they
  included the music video, "Regulate" by Warren G and Nate Dogg.
  In fact, given some of the great rap songs that are in this
  movie, they could've included a couple of music videos. It's not
  a great DVD, but at least it's not that expensive. I really
  enjoyed "Above the Rim." It may not be flawless, but it
  definitely does more right than wrong. The characters are what
  really dominate the movie. Even if you're not a fan of the game,
  it's still something to check out if you're a fan of character
  drama. Exciting, intense, conflict-driven and full of heart,
  "Above the Rim" is a very well done film. -Michael Cran</Text>

  Cartoons That Time Forgot. The episodes are a bit more wierd in

  <Text category="dvd">Fast Times at Ridgemont High is a clever,
  insightful, and wicked film! It is not just another teen movie,
  though to the casual observer it might be. No, it is a time
  capsule into the SoCal lifestyle that pervaded much of the films
  of the late 70's and 80's as well as it is a time capsule into
  the mindset of teenagers all over the U.S. circa 1982. Sean Penn
  (whom I'm not a big fan of) as Jeff Spicoli is truly inspired! I
  find myself to this day trying to imitate his dead on surfer
  takes. What an awesome character. When he says, "You d*ck!" to
  Ray Walston's Mr. Hand (another inspired and forever memorable
  character), you just wanna roll on the floor! Jennifer Jason
  Leigh is nicely sweet and innocent as a junior high girl
  struggling with sexuality. Phoebe Cates as the girl who believes
  herself to be in the only truly "mature" relationship anyone has
  (with a college boy) is fresh and believable. Judge Reinhold as
  Leigh's older brother is inspired. Mike Damone is a sleaze and a
  great character (if only he really believed in himself as much as
  he wants others to). In fact, this film boasts huge numbers of
  young actors who went on to become stars. The script by a very
  young Cameron Crowe is brilliant! Fast Times came out at roughly
  the same time as The Last American Virgin and several years after
  Rock and Roll High School. Neither of those other films is
  anywhere on par with Fast Times. At times, light and airy, Fast
  Times carries a serious "message" that teen agers are truly
  finding their way in life in the best way they know how. It is
  somewhat inspired that we never actually see the parents of any
  of the kids in the film. The adults we see are those with whom
  they interact with outside the home: truly, teenagers feel that
  their young lives are more affected by people other than their
  parents. While Last American Virgin approached some of the same
  topics that Fast Times does, it did it in a more sinister way.
  Fast Times doesn't gloss over teen age problems, but puts them in
  perspective of how the teenager his/herself deals with them. Yes,
  it's a comedy and yes it is funny, but it is not just a film for
  kids</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">I have loved thie movie ever since seeing it
  on late night tv. I had to search a long time to find it on video
  before dvd was an option and I have been waiting impatiently for
  release on dvd since my vhs is wearing out. The gradual awakening
  of young Ta to which girl is truly right for him and Sammy Fong's
  attempt to disillusion his picture bride are priceless although
  the latter was often cut out during late night broadcasts. The
  ballet is sublime even though you can tell when they switched
  from James Shigeta to a professional dancer. Afterall, it's the
  music and the story that make this great.</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">That is what this film meant to me, looking
  at the kaleidiscope of life as it passes by, so sweet, so
  unsatisfying at times yet so perfect when the right person is
  there. This film is a poem to Paris and the passing of youth,
  with the hope of recapturing that one love, which when found
  engraves itself so deeply that it is like a hinge in the mind,
  always present, always remembered, always desired. The two lovers
  meet, seemingly a lifetime away from when they met by chance on a
  train, and with instant rapport they tell eachother in the space
  of a few hours everything that happened since they met 10 years
  earlier. They see how much they meant to eachother, how much they
  still could, like two pieces of a puzzle that fit. This is a
  genuinely beautiful film, more mature than the last one, much
  sadder and in many ways better and more realistic. It opened that
  sense of mystery that I have known, in life and its surprises and
  potential in the luck of finding true intimacy. Julie Delphy is
  one of those rare women who gets more beautiful as she ages. She
  has become a sad person, stalled in relationships, though she is
  living up to her ideals. Ethan Hawke is struggling to grow with
  his success, in a down phase of his marriage and needing their
  friendship very badly. Their relationship, so brief, rings
  totally true, in its humor, commitment, and occasional
  awkwardness. Perhaps this is sentimental, but I think I have
  known love like this. It is an image more in my mind than the
  person perhaps, but our friendship is as deep as it was when we
  met nearly 35 years ago. Some people simply pierce thru to the
  heart, earning a permanent place no matter who they later marry
  or what they become. It is an extraordinary sympathy for one
  another that is beyond sex (well, maybe not too far beyond...).
  Highest recommendation. This succeeds brilliantly at a snapshot
  in time, with an entire history implied behind it, like the
  greatest art. And I do think that the ending is ambiguous and
  must be interpreted, which is also so very much like real
  life</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">It is the declining days of the Great War
  (WWI), the Germans are leaving a small French town but are
  leaving a little present for the advancing British troops. They
  have buried the munitions in the town square. When the town hall
  clerk strikes midnight the bomb will be exploded. The town's
  people evacuate. During this the barber sends off a message to
  the British. The British decide to send a man to check this out.
  They choose the bumbling Scottish Private Plumpick (Alan Bates).
  Located on the outskirts of town is an asylum. The sisters who
  run the asylum escape with the town's people, leaving the inmates
  to fend for themselves. They return to the town, resuming their
  lives before being commited. Plumpick arrives in town but doesn't
  know that the towns people are actually the lunatics from the
  asylum. He meets the beautiful Coquelicat (Genevieve Bujold) and
  falls in love with her. He finally puts everything together and
  defuses the bomb (of course it's more complex and hilarious than
  just that.) He also finally puts together that there is something
  wrong with the town's people. The funny part is he feels the
  lunatics have a better grasp on reality the sane people. So shall
  he return to the war or stay with people he loves. This is half
  fairy tale and half fable. Alan Bates gives a great performance
  and Genevieve Bujold shows great whimsy. DVD EXTRAS: None</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">THE ROYAL TENENBAUMS is Wes Anderson's third
  major motion picture. The movie revolves around a rich, but
  extremely eccentric man name Royal Tenenbaum (Gene Hackman).
  Royal and his wife Etheline (Angelica Huston) had three children:
  Chas (Ben Stiller), Margot (Gwyneth Paltrow), and Richie (Luke
  Wilson). In the 1970s the Tenenbaums were one of America's
  premier families: Margot was a famous playwright, Richie was a
  junior tennis champion who later won three consecutive U.S.
  Nationals, and Chas started his first real estate business at an
  early age earning himself his first million dollars before he was
  thirteen. That was almost thirty years ago and the Tenenbaums
  have largely been forgotten. Betrayal, failure, and disaster have
  haunted the family and the laurels of their youthful days have
  withered and died. What's worse is that Royal's children and wife
  blame him for all their failures. Royal senses that his time is
  Earth is waning and he wishes to set things right. With the
  assistance of his faithful servant and lifelong friend, Pagoda
  (Kumar Pallana), Royal sets into motion a plan to redeem himself
  in his family's eyes. I'm a pretty big fan of Wes Anderson and
  have seen all four of his films. THE ROYAL TENENBAUMS is
  Anderson's most critically acclaimed and his most popular
  picture. However, it is my least favorite of his movies. Like all
  Anderson films the movie is filled with quirky characters and
  witty dialogue. The film is about the redemption of a man in the
  eyes of his family, a theme that I enjoy. Yet, the film just
  didn't resonate with me as much as Anderson's other pictures. I
  really don't know why that is. That's not to say THE ROYAL
  TENENBAUMS is a bad movie because it's not. In addition to
  everything else mention it also has some good acting, brilliant
  set designs, etc. I just prefer a movie about thieve brothers or
  a film about a precocious teenage genius or comic-drama about a
  sea-voyaging documentarian instead</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">This movie is my all time favorite. My
  friends and my sister enjoyed watching this movie and we watched
  it over and over.</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">The movie is a brillant mix of drama, love,
  and comedy. The casting was brillant with greats like Judd and
  Bullock. In the movie we are introduced to Siddalee Walker a
  women who has made her mother Vivianne mad. Vivianne always
  seemed heartless and distant to Sidda and when Sidda tells a
  reporter about her mother some things get twisted out of
  proportion and printed the wrong way, which makes Vivi mad. Enter
  the Ya-Ya's three of Vivi's friends. They feel that Sidda should
  know the truth about her mother and maybe she would understand.
  So they kidnap Sidda and start to tell her about her mother. We
  learn that Vivi wasn't well liked by her own mother and was seen
  as a bad person by her mother. Then we learn that Vivi's first
  love whom she never got over was killed at war which is why she
  hates her husband. Sidda then starts to question her current
  realationship thinking she'll be a bad mother and calls off her
  wedding. Phase two of the Ya Ya's plan. They must tell Sidda
  something about her mother that will change everything. Very good
  plot that will make you cry and laugh at the same time. This
  would be a good one to watch with friends or mothers. Penny

  <Text category="dvd">When Once and Again first began I dismissed
  it as a show for just women. But after watching just one episode
  I found myself hooked. This was unlike any show I had seen
  before. I actually found myself drawn into the lives of these two
  families. Once and Again is not just a show about two divorced
  people who find each other and start to fall in love. It goes
  much deeper than that. Once and Again follows the lives of two
  divorced people and the lives of their children as well. But then
  it goes a step further and it follows the lives of their ex
  spouses as well. With the first season we see how the
  relationship begins to develop between Lily (Sela Ward) and Rick
  (Billy Campbell) and how their ex's still play a factor in their
  love lives and how their blossoming relationship has an effect on
  their children. Once and Again was one of the finest dramas on
  television and if given the respect it deserved could still be
  growing strong today. Even thought it's time on television was
  short Once and Again showcased the acting talents of Sela Ward
  and Billy Campbell and launched the careers of Shane West and
  Evan Rachel Wood. I am just glad that we are able to enjoy this
  fine show on DVD and that they have finally decided to release
  Seasons 2 and 3</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">This movie is full of memorable scenes,
  although it's probably been more than a decade since I last saw
  it. It's suspenseful without being gory...the most memorable
  scene is one that is absolutely chilling without ever showing a
  drop of blood. And even though I'd read the book and knew the
  outcome I was on the edge of my seat right to the finish</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">This film is one of my all time favorites. I
  think it's because these kids remind me of my friends and I as
  kids - riding our bikes, going on little adventures, etc. The
  cast is absolutely perfect. Wil Wheaton was the best crying kid
  of all time - with the exception of Ricky Schroeder in The Champ.
  LOL. River Phoenix was excellent in this film, which is an
  adaptation of a Stephen King short story. Part road film, part
  coming of age tale, all the elements are here to tug at your
  heart strings.</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">I like this movie. A meeting happened in our
  life is very special and nearly miracle, but we don't think so
  almost always. The story except political things in this movie is
  thinkable around here. Screenplay and performance of both Bill
  Nighy and Kelly McDonald have led this movie to the excellent
  one. PS: I don't understand why this movie is not released in
  Japan</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">James, you wrote: "Ben is weak, immature, a
  stalker, lazy, has bad taste in women and at 21 is unable to tell
  his parents no when they ask him to wear a scuba suit for their
  family friends. Wow! Revolutionary film-making...not!" Yes, Ben
  was weak, immature, and had bad taste in women. His learning to
  overcome his weakness, immaturity, bad taste in women, and then
  defy his family and Elaine's family was his coming of age story.
  That WAS the point of the movie. It went right over your head!
  The acting was dead on and the subject matter was shocker when it
  came out! How could you not love this movie? Maybe you need to
  grow up a little to see the value. Watch it again in a few years.
  I think you will change your low opinion of this great classic
  movie over time.</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">Moving, intelligent, realistic, not overly
  acted (as could quite easily have been the case). About a 20 year
  old who has gone off the rails to come back onto them again...you
  see why this has happened, feel sympathy, and just want him to do
  well when the film ends. A story about hope, in a world with
  little..</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">One of the best-directed films of 2006,
  "Kiss Kiss Bang Bang" is built for multiple viewings and perhaps
  for cult audiences. And even though "Kiss Kiss Bang Bang" may
  require multiple viewings just to catch all of the rapid-fire
  dialogue, or to untangle the plot, one of the best reasons for
  multiple viewings is to admire the directorial skill: It's a
  Class-A tutorial for amateur filmmakers or simply armchair
  film-buffs who will appreciate the highwire juggling act that
  Shane Black pulls off here, with "KKBB"'s sudden shifts of tone
  from slapstick to dead-serious drama to gallows-comedy. If that
  seems like an easy feat, well... Remember "1941"? Not even
  Spielberg got it right. But Shane Black nails it here -- and it's
  his directorial debut. Downey &amp;amp; Kilmer are also at the
  top of their game here, but it's Michelle Monaghan who impresses
  with a flat-out great performance that keeps up with the
  veterans. "Sui Generis" (one-of-a-kind) is the phrase that best
  describes "Kiss Kiss Bang Bang," although it's remarkably
  mainstream at times. It's a showcase of talents for everyone
  involved, and when the bullets aren't flying, there's even a
  romantic comedy here &amp;amp; social commentary to boot. I can't
  think of any other film quite like it -- and that's just how the
  Warner Brothers tradition seems to work (at its best).</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">The folks at PBS deserve the gratitude of
  photography teachers and students everywhere. Taking on subject
  matter as impossibly broad as photography in 20th Century
  America? This documentary covers-- sometimes comprehensively,
  sometimes briefly-- virtually every important topic germane to
  the field of study, from Pictorialism to Straight Photography,
  from fashion to the scientific. Along the way, we are introduced
  (or reintroduced) to what has been the medium's most important
  uses: journalism and documentary. "A Century of Images" is as
  instructive for the novice as it may be reaffirming to those
  already familiar with much of the material. Underlying a wealth
  of historical examples and anecdotes are the two twin themes that
  raise this effort above the mundane: concern over the ethical
  issues photographs present, and the effects of mechanically
  produced images in the post-industrial age on the psyche of our
  nation. These themes manifest themselves in ways that are often
  revelatory and moving. One memorable example: the way Edward
  Curtis's images of Native Americans are placed into context by a
  woman who appreciates them, yet yearns for more images that show
  her people the way they "really were." Sections on war
  photography cover WWI, WWII, Vietnam and the Gulf War with
  compassion, and work as excellent visual aids to discussions on
  todays situation in Iraq. Another bonus: the section on the
  transition to a digital age has not yet outlived its usefulness.
  Until I was able to buy this fabulous history on DVD, my biggest
  complaint was that while using the VHS version, I had all kinds
  of problems locating the various scenes I wanted to pull out to
  show my photography and visual communication courses at the
  university where I teach. Now that I can happily locate scenes at
  will using the DVD menu, I can direct my ire at its few but
  significant omissions and shortcomings. More on Walker Evans,
  Robert Frank, Diane Arbus please . . . . they were pretty damned
  influential.</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">This movie is funny and by being so bold in
  so many ways is refreshing. It presents realistic characters
  without worrying about offending people by presenting sterotypes.
  It takes the time to develope the story effectively without
  boring the audience. It is a long movie but it moves at a great
  and effective pace. It is full of laughs. Joe Pesci is one of the
  best comic actors of all time. I don't think that anyone else
  could have pulled of the part of Vinny nearly as well. Marisa was
  great as well and it was hard to find a performance that was less
  than great. The writing and directing, two things that often get
  overlooked, was wonderful. The only weakness? The case is a
  little fantastic. It is hard to believe the coincidences in the
  movie that lead to the boys being accused of the crime. Of course
  movie plots don't have to make perfect sense but this stretches
  it. Though I usually don't like excessive foul language, this
  movie uses it in a funny way. I guess it wouldn't work without
  it... but don't be mistaken....it has a lot of bad language.
  Don't let kids under 17 watch it without supervision</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">I saw this flick when it first came out, and
  was chilled to the bone. It was one of the movies that helped
  form my opinion about New York City, as well - as a cold,
  impersonal city where anonimity could swallow you up! Over 35
  years later, on review, it is still one of the scariest movies
  ever made. The twists are nuanced and plentiful, as well as
  psychologically and emotionally devastating. Looking for
  monsters? One need only look in the mirror. Roman Polanski was -
  and still is, as far as I can tell - a master manipulator of
  perception. Rosemary's Baby is one of his finest films, and its
  timeless theme - the struggle between good and evil - unfolds in
  a way that is as real today as it was when first released. Oh,
  and I braved coming to New York 10 years after the film
  premiered. Still here and loving the city! I realized eventually,
  of course, that New York, as in so many films, was merely a great
  setting that provided a wonderful backdrop for this chilling tale
  to unfold. A player in the molding of the film's atmosphere - but
  not the cause! It could have been set anywhere, and been just as
  effective.</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">It is an excellent movie, very well directed
  and the acting is superb. It awakens the natural instincts of
  empathy, compassion and love, for children all over the world are

  <Text category="dvd">Very good film, hard hitting, emotional and
  I'm sure some aspects really do happen (although I have yet to
  witness much of it since I've been in LA</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">I totally love this DVD! They really show
  how to do grooves, not just some moves that you can only do to a
  specific music video. These are grooves you can make your own and
  go and dance any where with. That what I think makes this DVD
  series totally different from the rest. The moves are current and
  fun and the host and dancers are excellent dancers and also fun
  to watch. It goes slow enough and they turn around backwards to
  show you how to do it. LOVE IT!!! LOVE IT!!! LOVE IT!!! I am
  hooked on the Groovaloos</Text>

  movie should've ended real good is for Sonny to have Legal
  Custody of Jullian.I laugh out loud when I see this
  movie!!!</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">There's not much to say about the reputation
  of these movies. There's also little to say about these DVDs,
  many of which are the high quality special edition collections.
  Just do the math. This is no brainer for people who don't own any
  of these DVDs. Even if you only want 8 of them (less than half!),
  that's about $20.00 a movie (at Amazon's present sales price) and
  since many of these movies are special editions, that's still a
  steal! This is a solid place to start your DVD collection. Not
  everyone will enjoy all these movies (after all, they range from
  westerns to romantic pieces to musicals), but at this price even
  giving half of them away still allows you a tremendous savings.
  One note: the version of Amadeus here is the reissue and the
  longer, director's cut of the movie that was not originally
  released. Some (including myself) prefer the tighter original
  release (which can still be gotten at Amazon but sadly has no
  commentary and requires you to flip the disc in the middle of the
  movie!)</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">Before I rate the box set and the four
  movies I would like to give you a brief history of my life with
  these films. When I was really young I use to always ask my dad
  to rent Tremors and we would all set and whatch it. But when I
  got a bit older and I could understand things better I became
  afraid and was scared of Grabiods coming up from underneath are
  house and eating me. Anyways after about two years I got the guts
  to whatch Tremors 2: After shocks. And Afterwards I was agian
  afraid of Grabiods and now Shriekers attacking me. Finally after
  about ten years of not watching them, me and my buddy Travis got
  to talking about Tremors and he asked me what Grabiods where. So
  I dicided to draw him pictures of them and after a few days I
  ended up creating a Tremors comic. So after becoming so involved
  with Tremors again I decided to watch the first film again. And
  after it ended, I bought it off Amazon and a week later I bought
  the third movie and then another week after that I bought the
  second. I had literly gone a 180 from fearing Tremors so long ago
  to become a huge fan. And when the fourth finally came out I had
  my family, my friend Travis and his brother hooked. Now after
  being a huge fan and watching the four films over and over I can
  finally rate them. The original Tremors is by far the best; with
  it's all star cast and great story line. The second best would
  have to be Tremors 4: The Legend Begins because it stays more
  true to the first and it shows how it all began. Tremors 2: After
  shocks would be third best since it stared Earl and Gummer and
  Tremors 3: Back to Prefection would have to be the worst since
  it's story is weak, its short and it takes the evolution thing a
  bit far. Overall this is a great pack of all four Tremors movies
  and if I hadn't boughten all of them aready I would buy this
  Attack Pack. Ps. Tremors 5 script has been finished and if
  Tremors 4 sales enough they will make a fifth. And one more thing
  it would be awsome if Universal would release Tremors: The Series
  on DVD.</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">One of the movies I like to watch over and
  over. Jessica Tandy played a great character in this movie. My

  <Text category="dvd">this movie is definitely one of the better
  thrillers to come out since it's release.it's action packed and
  full of tension in it's 90-minutes of right-on time.kurt russell,
  always good, does a great job and this is no exception.the late
  great j.t. walsh,in one of his last performances,plays one of the
  best bad guys. i can't recommend this film enough for those
  seeking thrills, action and suspense.i can't really say what is
  wrong with the film but i just felt that it didn't belong in the
  perfect category,although maybe it should because it does answer
  on every call.a movie to watch again and again</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">Great movie and it was a pleasure buying it
  through Amazon</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">I will be utterly honest, I don't buy music
  CDs anymore. With so many bands hitting the streets faster than I
  can imagine, I honestly cannot keep up with them all. Music
  begins to sound the same, corporations seem to have their
  pre-determined hit prior to the public even forming their own
  opinion. Those like the Simpsons, Backstreet Boys, and even
  hip-hop artists are blending together to sound uniform,
  unoriginal, and overly drab. I had nearly lost my faith in music,
  retreating to some of my older music like DMB, Counting Crows,
  and Travis, but then I found ... The Suns. Stumbling around the
  Internet I discovered, shockingly, one of the videos to their
  album called "Romantic Death". It was one of the most creative
  and disturbing videos that I have seen in quite some time. Then
  it hit me, I couldn't get this song out of my mind. Throughout
  the whole day I had the beat, the lyrics, and the overall
  sensation of the song stuck in my mind ... and I had only heard
  it once. Like a drug, I needed more. When I returned home that
  evening I found the song again and couldn't stop listening to it.
  For the first time in a long time, I had found a new band. Then,
  I bought this album. Knowing nothing about the band except for
  the "Romantic Death" song, I put this in my DVD player and
  continued to be impressed. Their videos are just as smart as
  their music. Their tracks seem to cover every genre of music from
  folk, rock, and even hard edge. Their lyrics seem
  well-considered, smart and a voice to a new generation. My
  favorites of the album are: "Must Be You" "Romantic Death"
  (Parental Guidance is suggested) "Lost at Home" "Rockstop" "We
  Tried" In fact, every time I listen to this album I find a new
  song to explore, a new song to jam to on the way to work; a new
  song to enjoy! For those skeptical of this band, I suggest this
  album to test your tastes. Not only does it provide songs for you
  to burn onto other CDs which allow friends and family to explore
  this band, but also all of their energetic, original videos that
  will never see the light of day on MTV, but can be watched from
  the leisure of your DVD player. The Sun are a breath of fresh air
  to the music industry and this album finally got me out of the
  corporate rut that seems to be plaguing this industry. "...if the
  rockstops, it'll be all my fault..." Grade: ***** out of
  *****</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">When DVDs came out I thought that CDs were
  gone. I thought all bands would start making videos out of all
  their songs and selling DVDs instead of CDs. That's what happened
  with records. CDs came out and no one released vinyl anymore. I
  am so glad that The Sun was the first band to do this. Every song
  on this disk is golden. There ain't a bad song in the bunch. I
  heard about this disk on NPR radio. It seems that it was taking
  Warner Bros. so long to release the CD that the band made
  homemade videos for all their songs. The record company heard
  about this, watched the videos and said, that's cool, here is
  some more money, go and make the videos professionally and we
  will release it as a DVD, like it was a new idea or something. I
  talked with my buddies and most of them also thought this should
  have been done a long time ago. Another thing that is way cool is
  the audio tracks. All the songs are on the disk in .wav form too
  so that you can put it in your computer and tell Windows Media
  Player or whatever you use to put it on a regular CD and play it
  in your car or convert them into MP3s. There is even a sticker on
  the shrink wrap encouraging you to convert the .wav files. I
  could go on and on about how much I love this disk. I played it
  for my wife, kids, coworkers and they all loved it. Like other
  reviewers said, The Sun is a new classic. Keep it up boys.</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">(4.5/5 stars) Exceptional envisioning of the
  Batman comic book by Tim Burton. Michael Keaton brings an
  understated disaffection in the role of the billionaire with a
  disturbed soul and dual personality. Contrast this with the
  unbridled mania of the character in "Batman Begins;" both are
  equally effective, though one style over the other will likely
  appeal to you. Is there any topping Jack Nicholson in his role as
  Jack Napier / The Joker? Only he can pull off such an exaggerated
  performance and have it be so fun without ruining a movie. Even
  though his role is suitably funny, there is a little too much
  humor overall in the movie. Robert Wuhl's character is especially
  unnecessarily comical. Also, while Danny Elfman's score is duly
  heroic and compelling, the music by Prince just doesn't mesh well
  and is probably not the best choice. Nonetheless, the visuals are
  stunning, the action is taut and the film vastly entertaining. It
  is a testament to the film's influence that numerous comic book
  movies have subsequently used Danny Elman scores (including rival
  Marvel's "Spider-Man") and molded black rubber suits, though this
  film also owes much to 1978's "Superman" with its realistic
  approach and A-list villains. Great stuff.</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">Until Sam Raimi made Spider-Man, I think we
  all regarded Tim Burton's Batman as the best superhero movie
  (even though I actually don't consider Batman to be a "superhero"
  because he has no superpowers). Burton directed this movie, and
  did a great job - this movie looks like it takes place in the
  1920s, except that society is a lot more technologically advanced
  than it really was back then. Michael Keaton is Batman/Bruce
  Wayne. Needless to say, Batman is Wayne's alter ego. Keaton is
  magnificent at playing the character's alter ego. Keaton also
  does a good job playing the character when he's not in costume.
  Keaton's Bruce Wayne isn't as gloomy as Christian Bale's was in
  Batman Begins, which isn't necessarily a bad thing. But I would
  say Bruce Wayne was a little too cheerful for my liking in the
  Schumacher movies. But overall, Bale's Bruce Wayne is superior to
  Keaton's because Bale has a much more developed character to
  play. HOWEVER, Keaton plays a better costumed Batman than Bale.
  The problem with this movie is that the Joker (Jack Nicholson)
  steals the show - the whole movie revolves around him, so this
  isn't Batman's movie. This movie should have been called "The
  Joker." So if you ever wondered why Nicholson got a higher
  billing than Keaton, now you know. The thing is, the writers
  never bothered to give Bruce Wayne a personality, and they barely
  scratch the surface of the character's background - we know
  practically nothing about Wayne. You'd think the guy that's
  Batman wouldn't be so uninteresting, but we're bored to tears
  everytime Wayne's onscreen (and out of costume). But when Keaton
  is onscreen in the Batman costume, Batman seems so menacing and
  captivating that you enjoy all of his scenes. He plays an even
  more menacing Batman than Bale - so I say that Keaton does a
  better Batman than Bale, but that Bale does a better Bruce Wayne
  than Keaton. But Keaton didn't have anything to work with, so
  it's not his fault his Bruce Wayne is so weak. But one of the
  strengths of Keaton's performance is that if you ever met Wayne,
  he'd seem like the last guy in the World that could be Batman.
  That's something Kilmer and Clooney failed to accomplish, but
  thankfully Bale was able to do it. Michael Gough is a delight as
  the old butler Alfred. It's hard to believe Gough was a villain
  in so many horror movies over the years. I assumed Michael
  Caine's Alfred wouldn't compare to Gough's, but I was wrong -
  they're both great. Pat Hingle was really good (as Commissioner
  Gordon) in this movie. Hingle and Gough were in all four movies
  of the original series, and I enjoyed them both in Batman
  Returns. But in Batman Forever I didn't like them nearly as much,
  and in Batman &amp;amp; Robin I found their characters annoying
  as hell. Vicki Vale's (Kim Basinger) investigation into Bruce
  Wayne's background is completely uninteresting. But I already
  knew what she would find out, so maybe that's why I didn't like
  those scenes. I also found the Vicki character annoying,
  screaming in terror every three seconds she was onscreen. There's
  lots of little things I love in this movie. The sight of Batman
  rising off the ground after the two muggers shoot him, (and the
  terrified expression of the gunmen) with Elfman's dramatic music
  blaring. The look on Napier's face when he sees the emptied safe.
  When the guy got fried by the Joker's joy-buzzer (one of the
  worst deaths I've ever seen in a movie). When the mimes close in
  on the press conference and unleash a surprise, and the Joker's
  speech right before a mob boss dies. The first Action News report
  of the movie. The way "URGENT" is written in messy crayon on the
  parcel. When Batman jumps through the skylight (accompanied by
  Elfman's music). The design of the Batmobile - minor changes make
  the car even cooler in Batman Returns. When the Batmobile speeds
  toward the Batcave (again, Elfman's music is awesome). The grin
  on the young Jack Napier. The Batmobile attacking the chemical
  factory. The Joker's facial expressions when he speaks in the
  microphone right after throwing lots of money to the crowd. When
  the bat signal is lit - but it's not as awesome as the first time
  it's lit in Batman Returns, or when it's lit at the end of Mask
  of the Phantasm. And now a few complaints. This movie featured
  too many songs by Prince. After a while, they get unbearably
  annoying. There were lots of other great `80s pop songs that
  could have (and should have) been used in this movie. Another
  thing is the Joker seems completely helpless without his goons to
  back him up. So I found the final showdown at the bell tower a
  little boring. By the way, you can tell that Nicholson's make-up
  job would look a lot more realistic in this day and age of
  filmmaking. Burton's Batwing is cooler than Schumacher's Batwing
  (but not as cool as the one in Mask of the Phantasm). Anyway, the
  targeting system of Burton's Batwing seems a little screwed up -
  Batman has a big red target locked on the Joker, but the plane's
  missiles and machine guns miss their target. And the Joker didn't
  even try to get out of the way! Looks like Batman paid the price
  of designing his own weapon systems. I always overlooked this
  movie's flaws (until I saw Batman Begins) for two reasons. First
  of all, I found Keaton's Batman to be so cool and the Joker to be
  so entertaining that I ABSOLUTELY LOVED this movie. Second of
  all, the poor quality of the sequels make this movie seem a lot
  better than it really is. Pretty much everytime the Joker or the
  Batman aren't onscreen, the movie is boring. But I must say that
  Batman was even cooler in Batman Returns than he was in this
  movie - and nastier.</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">I liked this movie when i first saw it and i
  seen it about 10 times... i like to watch any movie that involves
  gangs (especially bloods &amp;amp; crips) so i can learn from
  them... If you're looking or are just a collector like me of gang
  movies... you may not want this one in your collection... becuase
  to me, it doesn't show enough Bloods &amp;amp; Crips in it....
  the characters are fictional....there are some minor gangs in it
  as well called The White Fences (Latino/Hispanic gang - i've
  never heard of this gang, so i don't know if they are true or
  not.). The actors who play the gang members of the White Fences
  are good actors though... i think they are better then Don
  Cheadle and Wayans who play Crip members... this movie centers
  more on White Fence and their rivalry w/ Crips... there's not too
  much focus on Bloods in here... it also more focuses on Sean
  Penn's character and Robert Duvall too (good cop/bad cop), and
  Penn on how he falls in love w/ a former gangmember woman in the
  White Fence gang. Colors is a good watch...i just wish it had
  more gang focus in it...and more gang sets (chapters, i.e. Eight
  Tray Gangsters, Hoover, etc...) If you're looking for a good gang
  buy, buy the book "Monster" by Sanyika Shakur a.k.a. Monster Kody
  Scott, or "Do Or Die" by Leon Bing. Those 2 books far surpasses
  this movie..</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">This DVD showcases a somewhat new (as of the
  2001 recording) sound for Sade, with slightly poppier and quicker
  supporting music. However, Sade's voice adapts beautifully, and
  she is one of those singers who just doesn't need the standard
  studio treatment to sound tremendous. Her buttery, chocolate
  lyrics come through with mesmerizing clarity on this DVD. After a
  few years of owning this DVD, I still enjoy and am transfixed by
  the wonderful editing, sound, and lights on this DVD. I highly
  recommend it to add to your "chill-out" collection. No longer the
  jazzy Sade of yesteryear, the versatility of songs on this long
  (almost 2-hours?) dvd will keep you grooving for hours</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">I guess the reason I enjoyed the movie so
  much was because I went into the theatre expecting a good drama.
  And that's exactly what I got. The story was very interesting to
  me. I enjoyed the relationships between the villagers, especially
  Lucious and Ivy. The scary moments just added to the drama.
  Having grown up in the country, I know how scary the woods can
  be. I loved all the twists to the story. The only thing I didn't
  like was William Hurt's performance. It was too hammy. I think if
  this critical role had been cast by another actor, the movie
  would've moved along at a better pace. But still a great
  movie</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">The funny thing about this movie is that I
  read negative reviews here, and rather agree with what they
  assert: that the plots and some of the characters are not very
  "evolved" due to time. If you disect the movie, yes this is
  *true.* NONETHELESS, I love this movie! I love watching the what
  the actors DO with this material, and how they manage, with so
  little time, to invest the viewer in their story. Emma Thompson
  gives a perfect performance, I think, highlighting how
  complicated long marriages can become, and the pitfalls of being
  "too functional." Bill Nighy is hilarious, acting as the needed
  jolts in between serious moments...quite refreshing. Most of all,
  it is genuinely funny. Life can feel (or at least my life can
  feel) disjointed, and I love a movie where a larger pattern
  emerges from seemingly chaotic events and connections.</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">WOW! I had forgotten how powerful a story
  was told with a wonderful, haunting score to match. I'm glad our
  pleas have been heard! With new High Definition equipment coming
  down in price, I can't think of a better movie to view for all
  with discriminating tastes and those will discover the finer
  aspects of the cinema. Update: Is this the Region 2 &amp;amp; 4
  version that was released overseas? If so we are in for a real

  <Text category="dvd">THE STORY OF NASA'S SUCESSFULL FAILURE! ! !
  This movie is base on Jim Lovell's book LOST MOON, the title
  coming from the fact that EVERY other astronuat that went to the
  moon the first time would walk on it the second. Lovell is the
  ONLY man to circe it both times he went there! What makes this
  film so realistic is that Dave Scott (7th man out of 12 to walk
  on the moon)was technicial advisor on the film. I've known the
  story of the flight very well for years before the film was
  released, and watching the film I'd say to myself that this is
  about the time that XXX happened and sure enough a few minutes
  later it sure did! Look quick at the very end of the movie for
  the REAL Jim Lovell, he's the Navy Captian with gray hair shaking
  T. Hanks hand! see the IMAX version last. Several scenes have
  been edited out</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">...but buyers should be forwarned that the
  print from which this DVD is made was a poor one, and Alpha
  Video, the distributors of this classic Capra movie, made no
  attempt to clean it up. Here we have an example of a key artwork
  about America's psychological and political framework during
  emergence from the economic depression of the 1930s, crying out
  for careful restration to the condition it so deserves</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">We all know the movie and story of The
  Silence Of The Lambs. I reviewed the movie and gave it a 5 star
  rating because to me, it is one of the best films ever made. Now,
  with Red Dragon, I give it 4 stars but I think this is a very
  good movie and what makes it so good is.... Anthony Hopkins, the
  brilliant actor who plays Hannibal Lecter. I don't think this
  movie would have been as good if Hopkins wouldn't have played the
  role of Lecter. I own the original Manhunter, which is an older
  movie and it was good but Hopkins can not be beat for the
  Hannibal Lecter role. This is a great thriller film!! Edward
  Norton delivers a very good performance as retired FBI agent Will
  Graham. When a series of serial killing style murders start,
  Graham is called out of retirement to help the FBI catch the
  killer known as "The Tooth Fairy". He eventually seeks the aid of
  Lecter to help him find who this killer is. Like Silence Of The
  Lambs, we find Graham visiting Lecter in his maximum security
  facility. Very cool scenes in this movie with some blood and
  violence. This movie holds true to the book with the same name.
  We get to see Lecter wearing the famous face mask he wore in
  S.O.T.L. Without going further into all the details of the movie,
  I'll just say this is a great prequel although it came after
  S.O.T.L. and the movie Hannibal. Also, Ralph Fiennes delivers a
  good performance as the Red Dragon. For anyone who hasn't seen
  this movie, it's a must see!!!!</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">this comedy, like Click has a funny side to
  it and then switches to a darker side half way through. the
  characters in this film can be hated at points, especially
  Michael Douglas' and Matt Dillon's but there is a lighter side!
  Owen Wilson is very likeable as Dupree, an unemployed party guy
  who is in need of love and a good paying job. the cast is fine
  and one of the strength's in this film! however, I think it gets
  too serious at points. this is supposed to be a comedy after all.
  I wouldn't buy it but it is certainly worth renting</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">The Brood is the lightning in the bottle
  that director David Cronenberg has never been able to duplicate.
  While all of his films definitely have his fingerprints all over
  them, The Brood managed to rise to the top of all of his films.
  It is absolutely dripping in a sense of dispair and dread. There
  is a pervading coldness about it - such that you want to wrap up
  in something warm as you watch it - you want to watch it with the
  lights on because you're very much afraid of what might be there
  if you turn off the lights. The film is a psychological thriller
  wrapped in a slasher flick. It warrants slasher status simply
  because of the sheer number of onscreen murders that take place.
  This is a very bloody film! Samantha Eggar is nuts and in a weird
  clinic for people like her. She is being treated by a creepy
  Oliver Reed (in one of his better performances). Art Hindle is
  her ex husband and he's worried about how she is treating their
  young daughter. After a while that is the least of his worries,
  as these horribly disfigured and (what the Hell are they?)
  bizarre little children run around killing all the people that
  have really ticked off Samantha Eggar. I won't say more, because
  part of the horror in a Cronenberg film is the pseudo-science
  that he get you to believe in. Whereas Cronenberg's Videodrome
  was weird, but not terribly good, The Brood is one of the
  creepiest films I've ever seen and a guilty pleasure (can I
  really call it that?) that I choose to subject myself to every so
  often. Really! What ARE those things?</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">The overwhelming impression I get from this
  film is: wow, these guys are alive! They are not just making
  their way through a boring life, they're out there doing
  interesting things, doing cool stuff, having adventures &amp;amp;
  generally living their lives to the fullest. The "they" that I
  refer to includes just about everybody in the movie, from Paul
  Pena to the guys travelling with him to Richard Feynman to the
  Tuvans that Paul meets and befriends. The documentary gets hazy
  in spots (I'm still not sure of some of the Tuvan
  inter-relationships) but does a good job of establishing empathy
  with Pena, a blind man relying on others in a place far from
  home. The DVD extras are o.k., the interview with the filmmakers
  gave some backstory to the movie. I did not watch the film with
  the filmmakers commentary turned on; a commentary seems kind of
  contrary to the purpose of a documentary but I suppose you could
  get more factual info &amp;amp; technical details on the
  commentary</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">This movie is really cute. Fluffy and not

  <Text category="dvd">The military courtroom drama,"A Few Good
  Men" is one of those films, that through endless cable showings
  seems to have taken a life of it's own. But even with countless
  viewings it retains it's emotional power and speaks to us about
  issues, that have become more important than ever. In the film we
  meet Lt. Daniel Kaffee (Tom Cruise) a young successful, military
  lawyer, who is considered so slick at plea bargaining out cases,
  that supposably he's "never even seen the inside of a courtroom".
  He is assigned the cases of PFC Louden Downey (James Marshall)
  and Lance Cpl. Harold Dawson (Wolgang Bodison). They are accused
  of murder and a host of other charges, when at the Guantanamo Bay
  military base they performed a "Code Red" (an illegal form of
  discipline within a military unit) on Pvt. William Sandiago,
  which unintentionally resulted in his death. While the two
  accused Marines admit they did the "Code Red", both claim they
  were under orders to do so by their superiors, which includes
  Base Commander, Col. Nathan Jessup (a brillaint Jack Nicholson) a
  powerful, highly decorated officer, who is being groomed for one
  of the top slots in the military command. With both time running
  out and a lack of legal evidence, Kaffee must get to the bottom
  of a conspiracy and present his case, even if it means putting
  his own career in jeopardy. Through a brilliant script (based on
  the play by Aaron Sorkin), Rob Reiner's steady direction and the
  cast's dynamic performances this film looks at the meaning of
  highly held military principles such as "code, honor &amp;amp;
  discipline". Should a soldier always follow orders no matter
  what? Whats' more important our ethics &amp;amp; principles (on
  which this country was founded) or our need for security? Is Col.
  Jessup right? Can we not "handle the truth"? It's hard to
  believe, that this film was made way back in 1992. In this post
  9/11, post Abu Grebbe world, where our country is on a war
  footing the questions, that the film seeks to address have become
  more profound and important than ever. The film is filled with
  great performances. While I am not normally a huge Tom Cruise
  fan, I have to admit, that Cruise does a wonderful job as the
  young conflicted lawyer. The same goes for the great supporting
  cast which includes good acting turns from Demi Moore, Kevin
  Bacon and Kiefer Sutherland. But what really propels and turns
  this film into a classic is the brilliant, dynamic performance,
  that comes from Jack Nicholson. When Cruise puts Nicholson on the
  courtroom stand and starts pointly egging him on, you just watch
  in awe as Nicholson just continually builds the character's
  palpable anger, until he just boils over and explodes in the now
  infamous "You Can't Handle the Truth" speech. Even though the
  speech and Nicholson's performance has been endlessly quoated
  &amp;amp; parodied, when you put it in the context of this movie
  it still has so much power and resonance. If you are interested
  in seeing a well made, movie courtroom drama, that is both
  thought provoking and entertaining then I highly recommend "A Few
  Good Men"</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">I have been waiting for this DVD to come out
  for a very long time! It is a hilarious movie based on a true
  story about the creation of the Bradley war tank. It shows how
  the promotion system in the military used to push for new war
  products to be used, even if they were not acceptable for use,
  and the struggle of one man to do the right thing. You will not
  stop laughing while watching this movie!</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">This is another superbly done documentary
  from the award winning PBS investigative journalism series
  Frontline (Peabody Award, Emmy and many more!). Disregard what
  one reviewer said about this being pro-Walmart propaganda paid
  for by the corporation. He's obviously smoking something, because
  this is made and hosted by Hedrick Smith, a PULITZER prize
  winning journalist who used to write for the NY Times. He is one
  of America's most respected journalists. I started watching the
  show since I was in high school (I'm now late 20's) and their
  shows are exceptionally high quality. Now, if Frontline is
  interviewing people who lost jobs and showing Rubbermaid factory
  equipment being auctioned off because they got put out of
  business by Walmart, how is this pro-Walmart? The story starts in
  America and its impact on the US economy. He interviews some
  professors, economists, managers, suppliers, and executives. Then
  the story moves to China and HK, and then back to the US. There
  are some very clear insights from nmost of the people interviewed
  especially from one professor who talks about the shift in
  American culture and business history. Is Walmart good for
  America? I can't answer that and neither can Frontline. This
  documentary does an excellent job presenting facts without
  judgement and presents both sides and the complex shades in the
  middle. It asks some thought provoking questions. The US trade
  deficit is getting worse every day. Quality is going up (some
  "Made in China" stuff is now very good and getting exponentially
  better every year), and that's really scary for us in America.
  Who's the blame? Well, all of us. We're not competing well in the
  global economy, and we want the cheapest goods. We're not willing
  to put our money where our mouth is. If you're interested in
  economics, history, social issues, this is a must see. If you
  care about the American economy, and global events, you should
  watch this documentary. It's loads better than the "Walmart, the
  High Cost of Low Prices" film (which is very one sided and not
  nearly as well done). oh,.. and start learning Chinese</Text>

  <Text category="dvd">John Waters is a very brilliant and odd film
  director. he brings camp, trash, filth, humor and morality to all
  of his movies, pushes peoples buttons, goes farther than most
  dare (and then some) isnt afraid of being censored and does what
  he does and to me thats brillance. true alot of people will think
  his work is tasteless stupid and gross but thats the whole point!
  lol! people who dont have a sense of humor or who are not open
  minded will not like his movies. these are not for right wing
  conservatives but they should see them (especially a Dirty shame)
  to broaden their minds a little more. my personal favorites are
  Pink Flamingos, A dirty Shame, Female Trouble, Polyester and
  Desperate Living. Serial mom is also a fav but not in this
  collection. He has come from underground trash to Queen of
  filth,trash and crudeness and for not being afraid of being bold,
  outlandish, outspoken and bizzar, I applaud you John Waters.

  <Text category="dvd">Despite the chintzy, unconvincing facial
  hair (Jeff Daniels' being the exception); Martin Sheen's
  too-gentlemanly interpretation of Gen. Lee's accent (and his
  beard); obvious &amp;amp; saccharine soliloquies about the higher
  purpose for fighting the war; generalized (and largely
  inaccurate) interpretations of the underlying history of the war;
  and hopelessly, ridiculously, wildly off-the-mark attempts atNew
  England accents, the film still works. I understand that to get a
  film produced and distributed, it is often necessary to have
  recognizable names in the cast. But an unknown who looks more
  like General Lee than Martin Sheen would have been a better
  choice. And C. Thomas Howell's performance--well, let's just say
  that his glued-on beard was more convincing than his acting. Jeff
  Daniels, however, does an excellent job, in large part because he
  doesn't try to convince you he's from New England and
  consequently does not come off like Cliff from Cheers, using
  every stereotype associated with nasal 'r'-dropping. Instead of
  focusing on the so-called nasality of the NE accent (think of
  Sheen in The Missiles of Octobah), Daniels allows the viewer to
  suspend disbelief. But then, here comes CT Howell again to slap
  you across the face and remind you that Sheen and Kevin Costner
  aren't the only actors who should have appeared as New Englanders
  in an Ed Wood production. I think the story works because there's
  enough commitment to historical military fact to make it
  believable. The battle scenes probably should have been more
  visually graphic to evoke the horror of the battle, but the movie
  makers either didn't have the budget for gore (maybe it was spent
  on the obviously fake beards) or decided to err on the side of
  forbearance. If Gettysburg had been made 8-10 years later, it
  might have benefited from the newer style of violence-depiction,
  as in Saving Private Ryan, Thin Red Line, or Gladiator. It falls
  a bit short of that, however. Finally, it should be noted that
  the producers/director seem to be operating on a rather
  simplistic view of the war's historical underpinnings, opting to
  represent the northern point of view as one united behind the
  idea of freeing the slaves. Anyone who knows about the Boston
  busing riots of the 1970s will understand that not all of the
  north is steeped in racial generosity and brotherhood. Very few
  who fought on the side of the blue fought because they believed
  in the abolition of slavery. They fought to preserve the Union,
  which is a very different concept. Abolition of slavery happened
  to be the issue that forced the South's hand, but it was not the
  sole cause of the war. The movie dumbs this down a bit, making
  the message more like what you'd find in a 5th-grade text book.
  The battle at Gettysburg was certainly pivotal, but viewers
  should remember that it did not end the Civil War. The north
  absolutely needed to win it, but Lee continued to cause the North
  fits for almost 2 years after Gettysburg. C. Thomas Howell will
  continue to cause me fits every time I think of this movie. Still
  and all, the film is very watchable. And due credit should be
  given to the re-enactors, arguably the greatest source of
  credibility for the film</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">The perpetrators of a high-level corporate
  scandal (Masayuki Mori, Takashi Shimura, Ko Nishimura) are
  pursued by the illegitamate son (Toshiro Mifune) of a low-level
  functionary that they drove to suicide to protect their schemes.
  This film begins as a deeply satisfying revenge epic, but the
  masterful director Akira Kurosawa is not content to let it rest
  there. He draws out all the moral complexities of the situation,
  then hits us with an unexpected development at the end that gives
  an ironic twist to his title. The bad may not always go to prison
  for their crimes, but do they really "sleep well?</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">SPOILER ALERT The ending of this 118-minute
  marvel seems an almost foregone conclusion. The bored billionaire
  did it. However, he and the sexy insurance detective play with
  each other until the audience is very, very hot. Pierce Brosnan,
  the billionaire, still sexist from his stint as James Bond,
  enjoys playing with the lady, Renee Russo. And she, as the tough
  but sexy Catherine Olds Banning, loses her heart to him, as much
  heart as such a sexpot character is allowed. In the process, she
  shows some very appealing nipples. The 1968 version, of which
  this is a remake, starred Steve McQueen and Faye Dunaway. In this
  version, to the socially irresponsible, self-absorbed 90s are
  ever present. We don't mind not having the suspense, we just
  yearn to see Brosnan and Russo "get it on." Dunaway appears as a
  psychiatrist who is trying to help the billionaire figure out why
  he is so socially irresponsible. Brosnan, as Thomas Crown, is
  bored, but open to being titillated by a beautiful woman, for as
  long as he is interested in her. For thrills, he steals priceless
  works of art from publicly-funded museums. The film makes it
  clear he can do so, under the noses of security guards, police,
  and hundreds of innocent art-lovers. Russo's insurance company
  insured the painting, so she is looking to recover the
  irreplaceable, but impossible to fence Monet, and save her
  employer a bundle. What we have here is a film with clever
  dialog, rich and exotic sets, and loads of sexual tension. One
  wonders now, after Enron, WorldCom, Tyco, and other corporate
  heists, just whom Brosnan is cheating in order to support his
  high-tech heist brigade. How many of his employees are going to
  lose their pensions or health care benefits over this. He never
  really, you know, works. But I digress. Dennis Leary has a
  character role as the streetwise New York detective, who advises
  Russo's Banning. As we watch her slowly spiral out of control,
  risking her job and her reputation, we are kept mildly engaged in
  the question of whether Russo will fall for him, or Brosnan. Duh.
  The film moves back and forth from caper to cover-up. This can be
  confusing, but who cares? All we have to do is wait for their
  next move, the next gorgeous set, the next revealing love scene.
  The Thomas Crown Affair will keep both men and women interested,
  for all the usual reasons. It is a film worth watching, and a
  great date flick</Text>

  that will offer quite as much as this movie did. Not to mention I
  absolutly adore George De La Pena. Awsome dancer and he was my
  favorite character in the movie. I love the fact that every
  character has something they are working through, no one is
  exactly perfect. To me, although the acting may not be what every
  one would call oscar quality, to me, it shows a glimps in to
  life. How pent up emotions can lead to frustrations that are some

  <Text category="dvd">Warner Herzog's "Grizzly Man" won the
  Director's Guild Award for best feature documentary, but the
  people who pass out Oscars apparently didn't agree. "Grizzly Man"
  was not among this year's nominees for Best Documentary. Many of
  Herzog's narrative films, such as "Fitzcaraldo," deal with man's
  attempt to challenge the indifference of nature, so "Grizzly Man"
  is not a departure by any means. Herzog's heroes are often
  obsessed with accomplishing some mysterious, even bizarre, goal.
  Timothy Treadwell's fixation is on grizzly bears. "I am one of
  them," he is heard to say. He survived in the wild, accompanied
  by a video camera, and, on at least one occasion, by a
  girlfriend., living among the most dangerous beasts in the world
  whom he apparently believed he was protecting. "Animals rule," he
  said, fist defiantly pumping in the air. "Timothy conquered."
  Treadwell became a minor celebrity during his life, appearing
  once on David Letterman's CBS show, but he aspired to more.
  Before letting his love of animals consume him, he tried his luck
  in Hollywood. He got an agent, and auditioned for TV and movie
  roles. He was, he told his parents, second choice for the
  bartender role on "Cheers" which went to Woody Harrelson. Missing
  out on that opportunity left him "crushed." What really drove
  Treadwell? He reminds me of fey little Carson on "Queer Eye for
  the Straight Guy," and as he openly mentions that it's easier to
  be gay than straight, I wonder if he was homosexual but unable to
  deal with his orientation, transferred his love of men to the
  roughest trade imaginable: grizzly bears. "I like girls," he
  volunteers, but then he mentions various cruising places - truck
  stops, men's rooms - in such a way as to make me think he had
  personal experience haunting these kinds of homosexual hangouts.
  He was also an alcoholic. Were his wilderness adventures an
  escape from passions he was emotionally and psychologically
  unprepared to pursue? Those who are seen offering their
  remembrances of Treadwell never allude to his sexuality. They
  describe a man whose life is ruled by a naive, hippy, New Age
  approach to nature and who died as a result. The bears, to whom
  he gave names like "Mr. Chocolate" and "Tabitha," need
  protection, he said, and he was their self-appointed caretaker.
  Others suggest that, despite his good intentions, he did more
  harm to the animals than he could have imagined. After Treadwell
  was eaten by a bear, the animal was shot and its remains became a
  feast for other forms of wildlife. Shooting a bear because he
  eats a man is comparable to shooting the customers at KFC for
  eating chicken. What is a bear supposed to do with a human who
  invades his turf? Treadwell was an intruder. One mans
  saysTreadwell made the mistake of thinking these were people in
  bear suits. But Treadwll knew these were animals. Trouble is, his
  knowledge of animals seemed to have been learned from Disney
  cartoons. The universe, director Herzog says, is ruled by
  hostility, chaos, and murder. Treadwell had a different
  philosophy. "Isn't that sad?" he squeals in his high-pitched
  girlish voice as he observes a bee who apparently expired while
  doing "his pollen thing." "I love that bee," he says. Partially
  financed by the Discovery Channel, "Grizzly Man" is superficially
  a nature documentary about a man who loved wildlife so much that
  he felt at home among the bears and wolves more than he did his
  fellow humans. But it's also a portrait of a highly disturbed man
  who admits he was treated for manic depression but rejected
  medication to control the condition because, he admitted, he
  needed those soaring highs and crushing lows. He also needed to
  record his solitary life on video. We see him crying as he pets a
  wolf, laughing when his command that God make it rain seems to
  have been obeyed, and arrogantly blasting the humans whom he
  perceives as the enemy of the animals. What we do not see is his
  final encounter with the bear that ate him. Mercifully, the lens
  cap was on the camera when he was attacked. The camera was
  running, though, and Treadwell's screams, and the screams of his
  girlfriend, were recorded. Out of respect for his family, Herzog
  does not let the audience hear these recordings. Instead, we see
  him listening to the audio, and his reaction (telling one of
  Treadwell's friends that she must never listen to it, just as she
  must never see the coroner's photos of the aftermath of the
  attack), is possibly more effective than including the obviously
  horrific sounds in the film. "I had no life," Treadwell said of
  his days before he began to frolic with ferocious beasts. "Now I
  have a life." That life is memorialized in Herzog's film. Brian

  just as enjoying, thrilling and suspenseful as it was when I saw
  it first more than 10 years ago. My 12 years old daughter watched
  it with me for the first time and enjoyed it just as well. Great
  performance by all cast but especially Hanks, Paxton and Beacon.
  Probably Ron Howard best film ever</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">It's strange; this just came on FX, and once
  it was on, I was compelled to stay up and watch the whole thing,
  even though I've already seen it (in the theatres during its
  initial release run), and it cost me sleep to watch it all the
  way through this time around. Even for all of the bad press that
  this movie got, and all of the disgruntled viewers who were
  expecting another horror, this truly is one of my favorites from
  M. Night Shyamalan - this, along with "Lady In The Water"
  (another MUST have for me), is a movie that I feel compelled to
  add to my collection. As the other reviewers state, it's not
  truly scary, but more a suspenseful film, as I actually find ALL
  of Shyamalan's movies to be. In my humble opinion, he's not
  trying to provide movies best-suited to Halloween scare-fest
  marathons, but movies that are suspenseful and thought-provoking.
  As annoying as some of his ticks may be to some viewers, there's
  thought put into each of his films, unlike stupid wastes of
  celluloid like "Hostel" and those damned "Saw" movies (enough,
  already)! At least after seeing this in the theatre, I felt that
  I'd gotten my money's worth for the ticket price, and this is
  definitely a movie that I feel I could watch repeatedly. In my
  opinion, the social commentary and romantic aspects only add to
  the viewing experience provided by this film. Don't buy this if
  you're looking for a horror like "The Exorcist" - if that's what
  you want, buy and watch "The Exorcist". If you're looking for a
  film with twists and turns that tie in to a somewhat deeper
  meaning, and will have you nodding your head in agreement with
  the way things play out on screen, buy this movie. Even if you
  know what happens in the end, I'm sure you'll find yourself
  wanting to watch it again over time</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">Intimacy isn't about titillation or tanned
  toned Hollywood studs and babes having perfectly choreographed
  sex in beautiful lighting while poor piano music plays. Instead
  it's about an ordinary pair of people seeking solace in a purely
  physical relationship. Both are empty individuals and briefly
  find something to fire them in their weekly sexual meetings.
  Nothing is said but there is a purity of understanding. The
  relationship, and the film, only falters when the film moves
  outside the seedy flat that the liaisons take place in. The
  wordless arrangement can only work while everything is strictly
  anonymous, and once Jay (Rylance) delves into Claire's (Fox)
  personal life their apparently simple relationship becomes more
  complicated. It's also here that the film briefly slumps. Jay
  encounters Claire's taxi driver husband, played by an
  uncharacteristically off form Timothy Spall. Speaking nonsense
  and totally over the top, his scenes are almost unbearably
  dreary. I can certainly see why Claire would want peace and quiet
  and intense sex after listening to that intensely boring man
  twitter on. Still, it doesn't make his scenes any better to
  watch. Despite that though the film regains it footing and ends
  strongly. Even Timothy Spall's character shows some hidden
  depths! However, Intimacy works best as a comment on the
  relationships people trap themselves in. It's easier to stay in
  an unhappy relationship than walk out, and starting something new
  takes courage. Jay and Claire are unable to escape their empty
  lives, except in their sexual relationship. Really both are
  cowards. Neither is happy, but neither makes a serious effort to
  change their circumstances. Sex is a temporary answer to a
  permanent problem, and until they reach out for something more
  neither will be happy. The film had an increasing energy which I
  liked, and I'm sure you would like it too, if you let yourself
  inside the film.</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">If you liked "Raise the Red Lantern" or "The
  Last Emperor",this is a perfect movie.Gong Li,who played a
  concubine fighting with others for her husband's affection now
  plays a woman who realizes another man loves her husband.
  "Farewell My Concubine" uses Chinese opera as a way of telling
  the story.I used to listen to a lot of Chinese opera--which is an
  acquired taste.This movie uses the story of a king&amp;amp;his
  beloved concubine's self-sacrifice to frame the love story
  between two men.When one of the men falls in love with and
  marries a woman,the stage is set for a tragic love triangle.The
  final scenes are chilling,powerful.This is a spectacle not to be

  <Text category="dvd">Let me preface this review by stating that
  if I had to do this 90-minute workout in its entirety I'd
  probably never reach for it -- it's just too long. But in its dvd
  format Karen Voight has thoughtfully provided a menu that has
  made this otherwise excellent program usable and doable. It's set
  up so that you can follow it in logical sections and, best of
  all, you can completely skip the squat sequence and just do the
  amazingly thorough floor workout, which is terrific for those
  like me who suffer from knee problems which prevent us from
  performing squats and lunges. I am able to successfully break
  this whole program down into *warmup/arms/abs/cooldown-stretch*
  Mondays and Thursdays, and *warmup/floor legs/cooldown-stretch*
  on Tuesdays and Fridays, and each intense workout is about 45
  minutes. Music and clothing - especially the men's outfits! - are
  dated but I can get over it (though I'm sure there are others who
  cannot). Broken into shorter segments, I rate this 4.5 stars
  which I round up to 5.</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">This movie captures faithfully what is in my
  imagination when I read the book. Even though it was made several
  years ago, it's still a fantastic movie. Timeless</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">Tim Burton offers the most charmingly
  off-beat yet visually sumptuous movies in Hollywood. From his
  stop-animation work ("The Corpse Bride") to dark romances
  ("Edward Scissorhands") to horror ("Sleepy Hollow"), Burton never
  fails to offer feasts for the eyes that manage to make you squirm
  just a bit uncomfortably - all the right notes are there, but
  some are played just off-key enough to create the thrill of
  tension. Perhaps no other director was so suited to film Roald
  Dahl's most famous work, "Charlie and the Chocolate Factory," and
  remain true to the author's vision. Most people associate the
  tamer, goofy "Willie Wonka and the Chocolate Factory," starring
  Gene Wilder, with Dahl's tale, but forget that Dahl had a healthy
  streak of Lemony Snicket sensibility to him. So it is perfect
  that Burton makes a darker, more dangerous film for all to enjoy.
  The visuals in "Charlie" are astounding. The chocolate waterfall
  and river look like actual liquid chocolate (not the icky brown
  water of "Willie Wonka"), and the squirrel-nut-sorting room is a
  classic of mind-blowing set design. And that is not all - oh, no,
  that is not all! Possibly the most visually stunning element in
  "Charlie" is Willie Wonka himself, played by Burton favorite
  Johnny Depp. Depp sinks so deep into his roles that he becomes
  one with them, and one wonders what inspired Depp's quirky,
  nervous, mean-spirited, selfish concoction. Depp plays Wonka as
  tight as he plays Jack Sparrow loose, and he never misses a note.
  But whereas Gene Wilder's Willie Wonka was more genial
  puppetmaster, Depp's Wonka has a sadistic streak in him, perhaps
  instilled by his dentist father. This is a great, if
  much-maligned, performance. The most infamous element from the
  first movie was the seemingly-drug-inspired presence of the
  Oompa-Loompas, Wonka's army of diminutive henchmen. In the Wilder
  film, the Oompa-Loompas were dwarfs given to sophomoric dance
  numbers to the irritatingly catchy "oompa-loompa-do-be-de-do"
  tune. In this version, all the Oompa-Loompas are played by the
  same character (even though there are hundreds of them), and
  their dance numbers are even more fantastic. However, the songs
  don't have quite the same sharp punch as the original songs,
  which pointed out the various failings of the kids and their
  parents as they got eliminated from the contest. Indeed, there
  are several lyrics that I just couldn't catch in this film
  version, and that is a pretty major quibble. Far from a feel-good
  movie, but definitely a good movie, "Charlie and the Chocolate
  Factory" deserves to be seen and, for fans of artistic visions,
  studied.</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">DVD #1 presents a terrific hour-long history
  of the franchise. It hits both the high- and lowpoints, and
  indicates why the Packers are a national treasure and probably
  the greatest team in NFL history. Lambeau, Hutson, Lombardi,
  Starr, Nitschke, the Ice Bowl, Favre, White, the nine NFL
  championships, the three Super Bowls they won (I, II, and XXXI),
  and the one they lost (XXXII). The best fans in the league, the
  smallest venue, the most legendary stadium, and the team's
  miraculous survival over 80+ years, in no small part because they
  are the only pro team in any sport that is entirely owned by
  their fans. The highpoint, of course, is the 15-minute section
  entitled "Lombardi" which encapsulates the Green Bay career of
  the NFL's greatest coach--but at the end of this DVD about the
  Packers' heroic ongoing history, you realize that as great as
  Lombardi was, the team is greater still. DVD #2 was produced
  earlier in VHS format (I bought it at the Packer Pro Shop in GB)
  and portrays the greatest game in Packers history and one of the
  greatest in NFL history. Other reviewers have justly praised its
  play-by-play reconstruction and modern-day interviews with the
  participants. Yes, Kramer was offside--but luck is a part of any
  game, and the Cowboys had a generous helping of it in the second
  quarter. Like another reviewer, I love the postgame interviews,
  even the glimpses of Green Bay in 1967. The muted colors of the
  frigid game (maybe Packer jerseys actually were that dark in the
  60s--I see the same thing in footage of other games) and the
  elegaic tone of the final interviews give a haunting sense of a
  world that is now departed.</Text>

  <Text category="dvd">2 Fast 2 Furious is one of those sequels
  that comes around every so often that doesn't require you to have
  seen the original. I saw this movie for the first time not too
  long after it came out, and having never seen the original, I
  thought I would be lost and wouldn't enjoy myself as much as
  other people, but on the contrary - I left the experience much
  happier than when I came in. This film is full of quick
  one-liners that deserve a laugh. The special effects and the car
  races will leave your mouth gaping open. I have heard and read
  that people didn't appreciate this film as much because it seemed
  to focus more on a plot than the first film did rather than focus
  more on the races, but overall, I think the balance works well.
  Even thinking of the plot that we are left with, I really can't
  see another time when a race would even be appropriate. And as
  for people saying that this film is worse than the original, I
  would have to disagree...Why? Frankly, I have always been a firm
  believer than Vin Diesel is entirely overrated as an actor. (I
  mean, c'mon - Have you seen the Pacifier?) He's nothing more than
  a meat head who, while able to do pretty good fight scenes,
  should leave the dialogue to someone else. Yes, this film is for
  the younger crowd, and there are numerous occasions when
  unbelievable events take place (take the boat jumping as an
  example), but there is no saying that an older person wouldn't
  enjoy it as well...The only thing that I will say is that you
  really shouldn't go into this film expecting an Oscar worthy
  performance, or else you will be disappointed. If you sit back
  and take this as the fun romp that it is, however, you will
  thoroughly enjoy yourself</Text>

  <Text category="dvd">In Alan Alda's &amp;amp;quot;Betsy's
  Wedding&amp;amp;quot;,he is Eddie Hopper,a construction foreman
  and architect. His daughter Betsy(Molly Ringwald) and her
  boyfriend Jake Lovell(Dylan Walsh) announce their engagement at a
  family gathering. Betsy's sister Connie(Ally Sheedy) is happy
  herself but jealously upset because she can't find herself a man.
  The late Madeline Kahn is Lola,Eddie's wife. At the gathering
  Lola's sister Gloria Henner(Catherine O'Hara) tells her she plans
  to get even with her husband Oscar(Oscar winner Joe Pesci) for
  all his inept schemes. Gloria says &amp;amp;quot;Someday,when I
  have my nice little nestegg,I can take a walk and he can go f---
  himself.&amp;amp;quot; Anthony LaPaglia is Stevie Dee,a guy who
  would later in the film become Connie's boyfriend. Stevie Dee's
  uncle Georgie(Burt Young) is a business associate of Oscar's.
  There's once scene where when Betsy and Jake meet with the man
  performing their wedding ceremony,the Dixie Cups' CHAPEL OF LOVE
  is played. They want to be pronounced &amp;amp;quot;husband and
  wife&amp;amp;quot; instead of &amp;amp;quot;man and
  wife&amp;amp;quot; and they have &amp;amp;quot;obey&amp;amp;quot;
  omitted from &amp;amp;quot;love,honor and obey&amp;amp;quot;. The
  late Julie Bovasso plays Rose,Eddie's mother and Joey Bishop is
  Eddie's deceased father. The father,as a ghost,is seen and heard
  only by Eddie. The wedding was somewhat disasterous. It took
  place in a rented tent on a rainy evening. The tent was made of
  cheap,not-too-strong materials so a hole in the roof where the
  rain fell into increased to the point where it caved in. After a
  heated argument between Gloria and Oscar at the reception also in
  the tent,Gloria pulls a loose thread causing the growing hole and
  the dowse of fallen rain. So Connie and Stevie Dee can be
  together more often,Stevie Dee applies to the police
  academy,since Connie's a cop. Unbelievably,the wedding dinner was
  pizza! By the way,Oscar planned to divorce Gloria and become
  romantically involved with his secretary,who also attended
  Betsy's and Jake's wedding. That was one of the things that led
  to the argument. The wedding ceremony was performed in the Jewish
  style. Jake stepped on a wine glass wrapped in a cloth napkin.
  This film was Alan Alda's most successful and not a minor hit

  for this film as the quality of being familiar and strange at the

  and having vaguely remembered seeing it somewhere. The movie does
  not have a linear, logical storyline. It is a mood piece, for

  viewer brings to the interpretation as much as what appears on

  <Text category="dvd">The fifteen-year-old Duncan (Emile Hirsch)
  and his laconic father Edgar Mudge (Richard Jenkins) are reeling
  after the death of the most important person in their life.
  Duncan's mother and Edgar's wife died suddenly, whilst biking
  some farm eggs to her neighbor. An alcoholic, she was the glue
  that tethered this family together, and her death has left Duncan
  and Edgar emotionally fragile and at a loss. It isn't only his
  wife's passing that is bothering Edgar; he notices that Duncan's
  a "different" kind of boy - sensitive, kindly and delicate.
  Duncan constantly dotes on his pet chicken and dresses in his
  mother's clothes, perhaps in an effort to stay connected to him
  mom. At church - where he sings out of tune - a neighbor in their
  tiny farm community comments on how Duncan is the spitting image
  of his mom. Duncan is soft, not in an effeminate way; it's just
  that he has an intuitiveness and a compassion that places him at
  odds with some of the older and rougher boys, who mock him, and
  call him "weird" and question his sexuality, something he's
  already tormented over. Was Duncan a mama's boy? Well, we're not
  really sure. Obviously there was incredible love between them
  both, but it's a love that his father is unable to replicate.
  Edgar worries about his son and he loves him dearly, but he's is
  clueless about how to help him. He tries to get him to help out
  around the farm in an effort to toughen him up. He also
  encourages Duncan to go out with his older friends, the
  ringleader of which is Perry (Tom Guiry), a butch and macho town
  stud who likes to brag about his sexual conquests. Perry's
  bravado is a cover-up for his scary feelings toward Duncan, and
  it's only a matter of time before their relationship reaches a
  crisis. Mudge Boy is the perfect example of understatement, a
  tale of bourgeoning same sex attraction, and also a titular
  exploration of the isolation of farm life. Deeply religious,
  Edgar could be the fire and brimstone type of father; instead
  he's a thoughtful, considerate and caring man, who is at a loss
  at how to deal with his eccentric son. Hirsch, who projects a shy
  modesty, is perfectly cast as Duncan - a boy who is somewhat out
  of his depth with the people around him, an outcast with many
  quirks and eccentricities. At times, Mudge Boy can be difficult
  to watch, there's a quasi-rape scene, where the result of some
  teenage sexual experimentation reaches an ugly climax. But
  writer-director Michael Burke is always sensitive to his subject
  matter, beautifully rendering his protagonists' dysfunctions and
  setting them against a bucolic backdrop of Vermont farm land with
  it's meadows, tumbling down barns and cow patches. Whether Duncan
  is sweetly ingratiating himself and getting drunk with the local
  in crowd, or sucking on the head of his pet chicken, he's a
  character who many of us will probably be able to relate to. He's
  desperate to fit in, confused about his bourgeoning sexuality and
  is undoubtedly a troubled and confused soul. The final
  denouement, when Duncan is forced to confront the evils of small
  town bigotry is absolutely heart wrenching, as is the teary and
  world-weary reconciliation with his father. Mike Leonard May

  <Text category="dvd">Awhile ago I was having a conversation with
  someone about musical tastes where we vastly disagreed on what
  was simply awesome bands and which ones were purely based around
  taste, such as people who love R&amp;amp;B and Rap to people who
  prefer Dance. In a way, Texas Chainsaw Massacre, as well as the
  Exorcist and the Shining are like the Beatles and Led Zeppelin of
  horror movies: you must love them and say anything different and
  you're going to get lynched. So I will agree that the film is
  definately refreshing considering the latest crop of so-called
  "horror movies", yet at the same time I wonder why it didn't hit
  me that much. 5 kids are travelling through the country and hear
  of a couple of houses. They decide to check it out only no one's
  home...seemingly at first. Pretty soon they meet Leatherface, a
  man in a burlap sac mask who wields a big fat chainsaw. Pretty
  soon, the kids start going one by one and we find a family
  seriously depraved and having to escape alive. It's odd how I
  can't say any more about the plot; not because of spoilers but
  because there's not a lot else to say. Like many a filmgoer, I
  can't stand the latest releases in horror. Instead of using
  atmosphere, pacing and mood to creep people out, they go for
  broke and show some of the more violent scenes. This film isn't
  even gory at all. In fact, the film's goriest scene, where one of
  the kids meets a chainsaw, isn't even shown onscreen. Your mind
  fills in what went on which can probably be even more disturbing.
  Adding to the realism is that it's shot in a kind of
  documentary-like style. One problem I had with the film was that
  the dread didn't feel there. There was pre-MTV style editing and
  extreme-closeups of eyeballs and maybe I've just seen it before
  but it didn't creep me out like it should've(and having a woman
  scream for 20 minutes doesn't help). If I saw this in 1974, I
  mostly likely would've been creeped out of my wits but seeing it
  32 years later, it's more like "yeah it was alright although I
  better not say so cause then everybody will bug me about it". If
  you're a fan, go ahead and buy it because it's probably the best
  release of the film but personally, I'm not</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">I saw this movie on t.v. for the first time
  a few days ago and now I'm buying the DVD. I'm not a big fan of

  a few negative reviews about this film and I think they are
  undeserved. When I saw it I thought it was good, not Diehard
  good, but it held its own. I really enjoyed it. I really liked
  the idea that they included a female member of SWAT. One never
  sees a woman SWAT member. It looks like this is one of those
  movies you either love, like, or hate. One has to make up one's
  own mind</Text>

  <Text category="dvd">I'm told by fellow film enthusiasts that
  Bu&amp;#x1A;uel's later films do not show this Spanish master at
  his best, that his earliest films---his famous collaborations
  with Salvador Dal&amp;#x1A;, for instance---show an edgier, more
  fascinating Bu&amp;#x1A;uel. Whatever. I saw his 1974 film THE
  PHANTOM OF LIBERTY for the first time recently, and I immediately
  fell in love with it. There are those who swear by his more
  popular 1972 Oscar-winner THE DISCREET CHARM OF THE BOURGEOISIE,
  but somehow I think THE PHANTOM OF LIBERTY is even more
  entertaining than DISCREET CHARM. There is no plot to speak of in
  PHANTOM: this film is basically a collection of surrealist
  sketches that finds Bu&amp;#x1A;uel playing with all kinds of
  different ideas and different images. Monks pray for a woman's
  sick father, and then play poker with the woman and smoke. A
  group of people sit around a dinner table on toilets, and go to
  the bathroom to eat in private. Two parents desperately try to
  find their missing daughter---even though she's right there in
  class when they call her name. In the universe Bu&amp;#x1A;uel
  concocts in THE PHANTOM OF LIBERTY, anything goes. The amazing
  thing about this movie is that, instead of seeming like an
  irrational series of surrealistic sketches, THE PHANTOM OF
  LIBERTY has a broad theme to support its free-form structure:
  it's Bu&amp;#x1A;uel's comic vision of freedom run amuck. Sure,
  the idea of liberty is appealing to everyone...but, as
  Bu&amp;#x1A;uel seems to be suggesting, even freedom has its
  limits. The opening scene of the movie is set in Toledo, Spain in
  1808, as Napoleon's troops attempt to liberate the Spanish and
  are greeted with cries of "Down with liberty!" There can be times
  when we want the assurance of authority, rather than the freedom
  to act in whatever way we please. Bu&amp;#x1A;uel doesn't take a
  stand one way or the other, really; he's just an artist who is
  intrigued by the idea, and his interest fuels the free-form
  structure of the film, and its content. Almost anything and
  everything he can think of---within the bounds, I suppose, of the
  same themes he covered throughout his long and illustrious film
  career---is thrown into this movie, and while some viewers may
  perhaps prefer the comfort of a movie with some structure, I
  found its elegant chaos exhilarating. Only a master filmmaker who
  had absolute confidence in what he was doing would dare make a
  movie like this. I think Bu&amp;#x1A;uel pulls it off
  triumphantly here; somehow, he makes the movie seem almost
  logical, the way it progresses. THE PHANTOM OF LIBERTY is a sheer
  delight. Highly recommended</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">Believe the good reviews written here about
  this film. I havent cared much thus far for the movies Penn has
  directed after this one, I suppose its because I feel this is
  such a great film, he created a tough act to follow, but even if
  he never does top it, he can rest easy knowing he has made a
  great film that will stand the test of time. I like long moody
  films that you can settle down into a couch and get absorbed
  into, and this is one of those. Although, I would say it could
  have been trimmed down just a bit, as the pace gets just a little
  too slow in some areas. But overall this is a great movie, with
  great performances by all, and it packs an after-punch in that
  you may not really feel how much it has moved you until its over.
  Im not easily touched by most movies, but this film had tears
  building up in my eyes ready to roll with the ending credits. Its
  without a doubt one of my favorite films. This is the kind of
  film that reminds you, movies at there best can indeed be
  considered a work of art</Text>

  carefully directed by Agnieszka Holland, one of the major female
  directors in the world. This absorbing drama turns around the
  lives and times of three children who will meet each one another
  and exchange livings and fortunate encounters. On one hand, our
  little girl will know the world is not turning around her; and
  her initial solitude will be rewarded when she found out a
  hiddden that will make her dreams come true, and finally she will
  the one in order to impluse and bring back her cousin to the
  life. A triumph of the cinema and definitively one of my top
  twenty best films of the Nineties.</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">Great movie - there isn't anything I can say
  that hasn't been said 100 times.</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">This box set is worth every penny! This is
  an absolute MUST have if you meet the following eligibility
  requirements: 1. You have a decent TV (at least 32") and are able
  to watch in the dark 2. You have surround/stereo sound 3. You
  love 3D!!!!!! I bought this set a few years ago but unfortunately
  I made a BIG mistake. I bought the "Horror" collection- which
  works- except that the movies are horrible and hard to watch.
  Then a friend of mine turned me on to the three movies in this
  set recently (Encounter, Alien Adventure, Haunted Castle) and I
  was simply blown away. Now I can not stop watching these 3D
  movies!! The movies are all made by NWAVE pictures- and boy- have
  they done a fantastic job!!!! Informative, fun, and of the
  highest quality.....this is THE DEFINITIVE 3D package. Kids will
  love, and so will adults. Also, once you have the LCD shutter
  glasses, they will work on any "field sequential" 3d movie you
  can get your hands on. These movies are thrilling though-
  especially the non-stop coaster rides in each one. Do you hear
  what I am saying?? BUY THIS......NOW!! You can thank me later!!!
  100 stars if I could and of course..HIGHLY RECCOMENDED</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">If you want to see Lena Heady's breasts
  exposed, this is the film to watch. But besides the numerous
  unnecessary topless scenes (which aren't too bad) this film is
  very intriguing...the human spirit tries to break through walls
  of addiction, frustration and isolation... now isn't that what a
  "suspense" drama should be about</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">Argento is an incarnation of everything that
  film is and everything that it could have been as conceived by
  Lumiere. After Hitchcock and Ray, Leone and Fuller, Argento is
  the last true auteur to make genre films. Visually, a film like
  Profondo Rosso calls upon the ghosts of the cinema because
  everything that is filmed, objects and people alike, take on the
  same importance and that this inevitably leads to the resolution
  of the mystery which is at the center of the film. Argento can
  only film something as itself and this is why he is an
  extraordinary filmmaker. Cinema is not an answer but a question
  and Argento is the answer to Eisenstein's theory of film as
  violence, violence not only in the images themselves but in the
  great void that awaits them. A murder, a painting, a mother, a
  son, a mirror, all of these things will lead to a beautiful
  composition of images in which the mystery of seeing, the mystery
  of cinema, the questions, are resolved.</Text>

  <Text category="dvd">Really does not get the film noir credit it
  deserves (probably from its title with the uninformed film
  watcher expecting this to be a feature starring Dinah Shore or
  other 1940's musical starlet.) Some very satisfying twists of the
  old plot make this memorable and high on the repeat viewings
  scale. Gene Tierney is wonderfully mercurial - sometimes
  hot-hot-hot and other times just plain icy cold. This was her
  only Oscar nominated film and you can see why she was picked
  here. See Gene in this and in "Laura" and you will see two of the
  best 1944 leading actress film perfomances</Text>

  <Text category="dvd">I was thrilled to find this set here on
  Amazon, and buying this set is so much cheaper then buying each
  volume seperatly. All of the DVD's have some good interviews with
  the producers, designers, voice actors, and other people
  associated with the show. I don't usually like watching
  interviews/things where people talk a lot, but I love watching
  those interviews over and over and seeing the steps they took to
  make this show as good as it was. I totall reccomend it to anyone
  looking for something a little different</Text>

  <Text category="dvd">I just watched this AWESOME DVD for the 1st
  time and it BLEW ME AWAY! The Corrs are the BEST!!!! However, my
  DVD didn't include a Booklet. Did anyone else get a Booklet with
  their DVD? Or does "Live at Lansdowne Road" not include a
  Booklet? Please post and let me know, thanks</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">I was so pleased to find this movie on
  Amazon.com. I had watched it as a child and pinned over it when I
  could not find it in stores over the years. This is such a pure
  love story, with the main characters completely selfless and yet
  charmingly real. There are too few unpretentious, untampered
  romantic movies around these days. Most reveal too much-
  literally. But this one leaves you truly satisfied while lending
  pleasant modesty to a normally scandalous genre</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">Somehow - this movie touched my heart and my
  mind - and I am sure if Ben and Matt could figure out exactly
  what their formula was they would do it everytime. However - it
  just may be one of those once in a lifetime things - like first
  love - impossible to re-capture, and in a sense, haunting. I am
  not obsessive in any way but I have watched this movie at least
  twenty times - with each time revealing another layer of meaning
  - and with the movie becoming a place where I sometimes go for
  comfort. The synergistic combination of outstanding actors in
  their best roles - maybe their best ever - in combination with
  simply a great story most definitely puts this movie in a special
  category - so buy it and watch it. You'll be glad you did.

  <Text category="dvd">This 2-disc DVD set is a must have! Herein
  are contained 29 classic shorts spanning from 1930 to 1947, in
  the first of what will likely be a 2 volume collection. Included
  are some of Pluto's, and Disney's best cartoons, from the Oscar
  winning remake "Lend a Paw," to the first appearance of Chip `N'
  Dale in "Private Pluto." Here is a rundown of what you get in
  this wonderful DVD set! Disc 1: The Chain Gang (1930): In this
  black and white Mickey Mouse short, Mickey is a prisoner in a
  chain gang who, after musical antics result in a riot, makes a
  break for it! Two bloodhounds, officially considered the first
  appearance of Pluto in a double role, are hot on his trail. On
  Ice (1935): In this early, color Mickey Mouse cartoon, the whole
  gang is enjoying a day on the ice, but Donald Duck's prank
  playing nature puts Pluto in the spotlight. Pluto's Quin-Puplets
  (1937): In this familiar classic, the first "official" Pluto
  short, we meet Pluto's family, as his mate, Fifi, leaves him to
  watch over their 5 puppies while she goes after some sausages.
  The outcome of which is a drunken Pluto and a fascinating paint
  catastrophe, resulting in some bizarre looking pups. Great short!
  Beach Picnic (1939): Donald Duck, the official star of this
  short, sets out to have a picnic on the beach with Pluto in tow,
  but the day is spoiled by a familiar flypaper routine and those
  pesky ants! The Duck and the dog are GREAT together! Bone Trouble
  (1940): Butch and Pluto battle it out over a bone here, the
  highlight of which is that famous funhouse mirror routine that
  saves the day! Great moments with Pluto in the hall of mirrors!
  Pluto's Playmate (1941): While Pluto is playing with a ball on
  the beach, a seal takes interest and becomes determined to make
  friends, despite the dog's resistance. Classic type of Pluto
  story, to be repeated again and again in future shorts. Canine
  Caddy (1941): Mickey heads out for a game of golf, but Pluto and
  a gopher louse things up! Lend a Paw (1941): This Oscar winning
  short about kindness to animals is pure Disney magic!
  Surprisingly, it's a remake of a black and white Mickey short!
  Great story about Pluto regretfully rescuing a drowning kitten
  that starts to take his place in Mickey's home. Pluto's devil and
  angel make their most memorable appearance in this one! Pluto,
  Junior (1942): Pluto's pup, Pluto Junior, can't seem to stay out
  of danger, even in his own backyard! The Army Mascot (1942):
  Pluto notices how well fed the local Army mascots are and decides
  to try to replace one of them. He foolishly chooses a grouchy
  goat! The Sleepwalker (1942): Pluto meets his second great
  cartoon love, Dina the Dachshund, in this classic short. However,
  he's more interested in hanging onto his bone than sparking
  romance. Too bad his sleepwalking is working against him. T-Bone
  For Two (1942): Pluto and Butch the bulldog clash again, in
  another epic battle over a bone. Pluto At the Zoo (1942): This
  excellent short is full of animal antics, as Pluto attempts to
  steal a bone from a lion's dish at the zoo. Love the gorilla
  scene! Disc 2: Pluto and the Armadillo (1943): On a trip to
  Brazil, Pluto's ball gets mixed up with a friendly Armadillo in a
  brief stop off between flights! Very cute short that features
  Mickey, too! Private Pluto (1943): Pluto is given orders to guard
  a cannon from suspected saboteurs. To our delight, those
  saboteurs are Chip `N' Dale in their first ever appearance!
  They're living in the gun and using it to crack and store their
  nut supply! Springtime For Pluto (1944): This rarely seen, very
  colorful Pluto short is a pure delight! It's rarities like this
  that are the gold nuggets of the Disney Treasures series! The
  Pan-like Spirit of Spring awakes Pluto to a bright new day, but
  his enjoyment is eventually smothered by the down-sides of
  nature. First Aiders (1944): Hooray, Pluto and Figaro! This short
  is one of those great Disney team-ups that features a star from
  Disney's "Pinocchio," Figaro the cat! In this old fave of mine (I
  love Pluto and Figaro shorts), the boys battle it out while
  Minnie attempts to practice her first-aid skills on them. Dog
  Watch (1945): This is another fave of mine! Pluto is a Navy dog,
  and is given orders to keep intruders off the ship. A pesky rat
  causes trouble for him though, setting his sights on the ship's
  galley! Canine Casanova (1945): Pluto is madly in love with Dina,
  but can't get her to return the sentiment, until he rescues her
  from the local dog pound! The Legend of Coyote Rock (1945):
  Another old fave! Pluto is a sheepdog that has to fend off the
  legendary Bent Tail, the coyote! Canine Patrol (1945): In this
  short, Pluto works for the U.S. Coast Guard and takes his job a
  little too seriously, doing his best to keep a cute little turtle
  off the beach! Pluto's Kid Brother (1946): K.B. can't stay out of
  trouble, and he badly needs big bro Pluto's help when Butch
  tricks him into robbing a butcher shop! In Dutch (1946): Pluto is
  the local milk delivery dog in a little Dutch village. He and
  Dina get in trouble one day, when Pluto's wooing results in a
  false dike alarm sounding off. But, when the dike actually does
  spring a leak, it's Pluto and Dina who save the day! Squatter's
  Rights (1946): Chip `N' Dale are back to torment Pluto again,
  when Mickey and Pluto find them living in the stove of a cabin
  they are vacationing in! The Purloined Pup (1946): A wealthy
  puppy has been dognapped! It's up to police dog Pluto to locate
  the poor pup in the hideout of the number one suspect, Butch the
  bulldog! Pluto's Housewarming (1947): When Pluto is moving into a
  luxurious new doghouse, he discovers an unwanted houseguest in
  the form of that cute little turtle. He has bigger things to
  worry about, though, when Butch decides to move in too! From the
  Vault: Pantry Pirate (1940), separated due to ethnic stereotype
  content: Pluto does his best to sneak food from the kitchen
  without the housekeeper suspecting. From the Vault: A Gentleman's
  Gentleman (1941), separated due to ethnic stereotype content: One
  of Pluto's best cartoons, Pluto is the perfect dog to his master,
  Mickey, and takes every aspect of his role very seriously,
  including going to the corner to buy a paper. This is a fantastic
  collection of classic Disney cartoons, necessary for the Disney
  or Pluto fanatic! Extras include introductions from Leonard
  Maltin, Pluto 101 (an in-depth look into drawing and animating
  Pluto), The Life and Times of Pluto (a featurette about the pup
  himself), Pluto's Picture Book (a section of the Disneyland TV
  Show episode "A Story of Dogs," that focuses on the career of
  Pluto), Pluto's Pal Fergy (a tribute to Norm Ferguson, the
  animator credited with developing Pluto), fantastic photo
  galleries (including Sunday comics, posters, backgrounds,
  etc...), a DVD booklet, a certificate of authenticity, and a
  lovely collectible poster art card. The packaging has gone a
  little cheaper than past releases (no more paper wraparounds, no
  more printing on the back of the tin), and I'm getting more and
  more annoyed with only getting half-episodes of the Disneyland TV
  series. Will it kill `em to give us complete eps? Otherwise,
  another outstanding Disney Treasures set! Can't wait for the next
  wave, and Pluto volume 2!</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">Phantom Quest Corp. an action/comedy film
  about the drunken, karoake singing,party girl Ayaka and her
  friends taking on paranormal enemies, from Dracula to a possessed
  surgeon, mummies, and even magical monks. This Movie is a comedic
  romp through the world of supernatural events. The only set backs
  on this flick can be that the theme songs can get a little
  annoying after hearing them too many times, the series is too
  short although it was still good. The video quality was also
  pretty nice, and subtitles were understandable and on que. The
  plot is sort of like scooby doo without the guys in masks, but
  more action and laughs. All in all this film is a great buy and
  worth the money spent. A great addition to any anime
  collection.</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">Most people that like Wes Anderson's films
  are rabid fanatics, and I'm no exception, so when the chance came
  to buy his first feature-length film for $7, I snapped it up. If
  you enjoyed Life Aquatic or The Royal Tenenbaums, you'll enjoy
  this, on some levels, too. Many of Anderson's classy touches are
  already in evidence in this film. The story is fun, and the
  characters are well-developed. Yeah, pretty much buy it if you
  like the Wilson brothers or Wes Anderson. The high point of the
  movie is certainly Luke Wilson's character, masterfully done even
  in his first role.</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">Fraser's film is truly a winner in
  production quality. His attention to detail by bringing in his
  theatrical savvy is a nonpareil. Despite all the cliches that can
  be stated about this film; eye-candy performers, lighting,
  fantastic musical score, and riske scenes, this film has visually
  appealing sequences. If anyone is interested in film and
  theatrical production, I would highly recommend the director's
  commentary-you really get an insight to an artist in process.
  From the commentary, it seems that Fraser will never be finished
  with this film: a mentale that I admire in an artist. Art is a
  process and is never perfect. This is another one of those great
  modern plays that works very well for the film. Getting to the
  roots of the human psyche is something films should continue into
  the future. This film does explore the 3 dimensionality of
  people. I did have a problem with the didacticism of the script
  however. Though most writers try to leave it up to the audience
  to decide, I feel that the script gave little regard for wives
  who are victims of their husbands having gay affairs. I had to
  agree with another reviewer who titled his review as "Selfish gay
  guy ruins a marriage". (On the other hand, Cherilee Taylor did a
  great job in combating this fault with the script; she wasn't
  quite the victim her character ultimately could have become.) By
  the end of the film, I was wondering how Violet was making it as
  a once again as single woman. From an audience's standpoint, we
  didn't really see that. David and Kryla make up, Matt goes to
  illustration school, but what happens to Violet? Overall, I would
  highly recommend this film. With such a great interpretation on
  the screen, it would be nice to see this staged once again in the
  lort theatres.</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">CSI:Miami, having evolved with some pains
  over the first three seasons, dips in quality in Season 4 after a
  very solid 3rd Season. Anyone who has watched the show realizes
  that Horatio, unlike Gil Grissom or Mac Taylor, is the true star
  of the show. The rest of the CSIs are entertaining, but the show
  is truly about him. This dynamic, when combined with the glamour
  and glitz of the Miami setting and crimes most foul, make this an
  entertaining CSI and reportedly the most watched show in the
  world. Plotwise, season 4 gets too involved in personal character
  arcs to the detriment of the enjoyable crimes and mysteries.
  Horatio has a bizarre relationship and marriage with Delco's
  sister, a mole infiltrates CSI Miami, and the Mala Noche gang
  picks a fight that carries over into the fifth season and causes
  a death to someone close to Caine. These arcs were handled
  poorly, especially the storyline of the Mole, which when revealed
  was utterly anti-climactic, especially considering the Mole will
  be a series regular in Season 5. Emily Proctor and Rex Linn
  continue to shine as Calleigh and Detective Frank Tripp. Adam
  Rodriguez has a sleepwalking performance as Delco, and Johnathan
  Togo as Ryan Wolfe does little to distinguish himself from Gregg
  Sanders on the Vegas cast. David Caruso contines his acting by
  mannerisms technique, perfecting the hands on hip move, the put
  on sunglasses technique, and the dramatic pauses every four
  syllables style that has made him the great scene chewing
  overactor of the year. Watching Caruso is a drinking game's worth
  of entertainment. The extras of Season 4 are a bit pedestrian,
  with some audio commentaries, and three featurettes covering show
  production from shooting to post-production. If you are a fan of
  the show you will pre-order this one, those who don't like this
  CSI will be happy to know that Vegas and NYC come out within 30
  days of this release. A.G. Corwin St.Louis, MO</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">'Big Trouble' has a lot of big things going
  for it...big laughs, big plot, big cast...and because of all this
  it loses a peg or two...for there's just sooooo much for it to
  keep up with itself...you get somewhat lost in the jumble. The
  film stars Tim Allen in the central role, if you could call it
  that, as a journalist who gets himself and his son (Foster)
  thrown into one weirdly twisted plot involving crazed criminals
  (Sizemore &amp;amp; Knocksville) a hitman (Farina) a wealthy
  jerk-off of a man (Tucci), the mans wife (Russo) her daughter
  (Zooey) a homeless man that resembles Jesus (Lee in a histerical
  role) some mobsters, dimwitt cops (Garofalo &amp;amp; Warburton),
  FBI agents with attitude (Heavy-D &amp;amp; Epps) and a toad that
  sprays hallucinogenic saliva. See all that and I haven't even got
  to the plot, but it's one of those things you'd have to see to
  really understand. Lets just say everyone has a different agenda
  and they all get in each others way until everyones agenda
  changes to be someone elses entirly. Does that sum it up? It's
  funny, real funny, but it's also tightly woven without much room
  to adjust since it moves at such a frantic pace, keeping you
  watching closly to understand all that's going on. It'll mae
  sense in the end though, I promise</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">I only watched this because Joseph D'onofrio
  is in it,this movie is totall genious though</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">This is without a doubt, one of Harrison
  Fords greatest moments. An incredible film with some of the best
  visual effects I've ever seen. Very dramatic with a lot of
  suspense. A very well written plot and an all star cast make this
  a very enjoyable experience to view. A film you will want to see
  again and again. Action, mystery, drama, thriller. There are a
  lot of goofs in this film if you are into looking for such, but
  they don't in any way detract from the overal quality of this
  very well done suspense drama. I highly recommend it</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">Have watched it three times
  already.....thanks for being so speedy with the delivery</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">The synopsis ... Sam and Jonah Baldwin,
  father and son, have lost the most important woman in their lives
  to cancer. Seeking to escape from the painful memories that lurk
  in every nook and cranny of Chicago, they move to Seattle.
  Eighteen months later, Jonah can sense that his dad is still sad;
  and, in desperation calls a nationally syndicated radio self-help
  guru on Christmas Eve to wish for his father a new wife. Annie
  Reed lives in Baltimore and is engaged to Walter. Their
  relationship, while loving and comfortable, is entirely devoid of
  romantic sparks. When Annie hears Jonah's soulful plea on the
  radio, it's as if her heart has been touched by "magic" and she
  is determined to find out why she feels so powerfully drawn to
  Sam and his son ... even if it means traveling across "like 26
  states". The critique ... Sleepless in Seattle is a brilliantly
  simple film; that's what makes it so great. To quote Nora Ephron,
  "It isn't a movie about love, it's a movie about love in the
  movies." To emphasize this point, she incorporates various
  parallel references to "An Affair to Remember" throughout the
  film; but, Sleepless is also a movie about our genuine romantic
  fantasies and sentimental ideals about falling in love (which,
  let's admit it, have been undeniably shaped by what we've seen on
  the silver screen). The script is refreshingly candid, yet
  endearing and Nora Ephron's direction is impeccable. Ross
  Malinger, cast as Jonah Baldwin, is the youngest and most notable
  talent in the film. He does an excellent job of portraying THE
  quintessential eight-year-old; he's impulsive, moody and thinks
  he knows it all. (I speak from experience here folks; I currently
  have a son that age.) He and Tom Hanks come together flawlessly
  as father and son; so successfully in fact, that they would be
  utterly convincing off screen. The chemistry between Meg Ryan and
  Tom Hanks is equally amazing, which is no small achievement
  considering the fact that they rarely appear together in a scene.
  The supporting cast is brimming with talent and includes Rosie
  O'Donnell, Bill Pullman, Rita Wilson, Rob Reiner, David Hyde
  Pierce, and a young Gaby Hoffmann. Families with younger children
  will appreciate the film's integrity; there is very little foul
  language ("God damn it" and " ... it scared the shit out of me
  ..." being the worst of it) and no "sexual content" to be wary
  of. All around, this is a winning film. One that I find myself
  watching over and over and over again. The DVD ... For a 10th
  Anniversary Edition, the special features are few and rather
  disappointing. You've got your basic director commentary, a music
  video ("When I Fall in Love" by Celine Dion &amp;amp; Clive
  Griffin), and a "Love in the Movies" Featurette. This last piece
  is approximately 15 minutes long. It features the director,
  producers, actors and the hosts of Loveline: Drew Pinsky and Adam
  Carolla (why they are included, I don't know) talking about "Love
  in the Movies." There are some interesting interview segments
  with an Empire State Building Historian and some very beautiful
  shots of the New York skyline before 9/11; but there's certainly
  nothing here to write home about. By far, the most exciting
  feature is that you can choose your aspect ratio. (And honestly,
  how exciting is that?) This a DVD that you buy for the film
  alone.</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">I loved this DVd set! Grew up watching
  it..and remember running home after school to catch each days
  episodes. Watching this set transported me back to another time,
  when things were peaceful and less frazzeled! Stayed up till 2 am
  watching it all and felt like that little kid from school again!
  Like many young girls back then I was 'in love' with Tim
  Considine! So nice to see he and David back talking about it! I
  hope Disney Co. will put out the next 2 series of this great show

  <Text category="dvd">After being into the "techno" scene since my
  first party in 1993, this is one of the best videos I have seen
  describing the DJ feelings. You really get a feel for how a DJ
  thinks. If you at all interested in the DJ lifestyle or are
  interested in DJing this is a must have. It have great insights
  in the minds of some of the best DJs around. Plus Nigel Richards
  does a great job with the "How to DJ" part. Not only is this for
  the "newbies" but for those who have been around a bit. Plus he
  makes learning fun with his comments and body mannerisms. WOW
  that sounded like an infomercial</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">I followed Texhnolyze through it's fansubs,
  waited patiently for each DVD to come out. You don't have to sit
  and ponder, look hard and deep to find a meaning in Texhnolyze.
  It hits you right in the face from the beginning. There are some
  people out there that society likes to forget. Likes to shove to
  the backburners and ignore. In this tale, they are a whole race
  of people - the people of the underground city of Lux. And even
  within them, sides are chosen. You're either in or your out.
  Ichise is one of these outcasts and he lives by what he knows.
  The only thing he knows - his strength, his brute force. This
  point is particularly brought out in one of the last episodes,
  when Ichise makes the decision to protect Ran. He's come to feel
  something for the girl and, perhaps, in a way she reminds him of
  the mother he could never save. So he goes to offer the only
  thing he's sure of having - his body. That's always been his
  bargaining chip, always been what everyone wanted. Anger, rage
  and fighting. Though are all Ichise knows. How do you expect him
  to act any less animalistic than the animal this society made him
  become? It's clear through most of the show that he doesn't know
  how to react to people. Likewise, it's the same old sort of theme
  out of many a popular sci-fi movie - man bringing about an end to
  his own world. Ichise inadvertantly is thrust into all of this by
  his texhnolyze, Ran is thrust by her visions and everyone else by
  some intricate connection. But eventually, Lux collapses because
  of technology, the classic warning given in so many Apocalypse
  movies. Not each episode requires such in-depth searches for
  meaning. It all fits into the grandier scheme and message of the
  series itself. This series, as a whole, is a very good series. It
  does require connecting together pieces and keeping larger themes
  in mind, as well as a little psychology but what good series
  /doesn't/</Text>

  <Text category="dvd">I finally found out this was out on DVD
  after having the VHS version for many years. The DVD edit is very
  close to the VHS version minus the glitch during the scorpions
  opening act, plus some video strobing added during Cindy Lauper's
  run down the runway, which I'm not sure was really needed, but
  I'm ok with it, although the video strobing was done again later,
  which seems to me as a cheap effect, that really doesn't add to
  the performance. I think Brian Adams and Cindy was excellent for
  the parts they portraid. I thought originally sinaed (sp?
  whatever) was a strange choice at the time, maybe good for the
  part, but after seeing the documentary, I see her being a good
  intention decision at the time that ended up biting them in the
  end. She's too instable, and apparently did not realize the
  importance of such an event, nor did she show any respect for the
  part. Speaking of which, all of those artists that were called to
  perform at this event, and didn't say Yes on the first call....
  shame on you. If Roger calls you for an event, you say YES, and
  put whatever you're doing aside, because this was way too big of
  an event to try to be politically correct with. I wish there were
  more documentary material with this DVD, as this was such a big
  event, there should have been more information. I had heard in an
  interview before the show that Roger was once asked if he'd ever
  do the wall again, and he basically said "If the berlin wall
  would ever come down, then I would consider doing it again", and
  this was never mentioned in the Doc. Buy the video, even if you
  have the VHS, you'll enjoy it. ... Still waiting for Pulse to be
  released as well, enjoy!</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">I normally do not enjoy movies about the
  making of movies, so I was very pleasantly surprised to be
  thoroughly entertained by 'Living in Oblivion'. The reason I took
  the chance at all was due to the presence of Catherine Keener,
  one of our most overlooked and under-appreciated Hollywood
  actresses. She once again did not disappoint, but the entire cast
  was extremely good. You get a real education on the frustrations
  and challenges involved with making a low budget film. Buscemi is
  also right on target as the stessed out director. The Amazon
  reviews are for the most part positive about this film and for
  good reason. I'm glad to join my fellow Amazonians in heaping
  praise on this low budget gem</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">I am a huge Muppet fan, and was very excited
  to have the opportunity to get a newer, remastered version of
  this classic. While the quality is not too much better than the
  original DVD release, it is definitely worth adding to your
  collection, especially if you don't have any version of The Movie
  yet!</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">This dvd does not claim to contain a debate
  about the origins of Christianity; it discusses an alternate
  viewpoint (as Dan Brown reminds us "the winners write the history
  books")This dvd is a nice antidote to all the oppressive ideas we
  have been raised with; esp. the idea of God as male, and the idea
  of women being unworthy of church leadership. This dvd includes
  interviews with Dan Burstein, Henry Lincoln, Martin Lunn, Lynn
  Picknett, Clive Prince, Dr. Karen Ralls, Dr. James Robinson, and
  Margaret Starbird. I particularly liked Margaret Starbird's
  interviews - she describes how when she first read "Holy Blood,
  Holy Grail", she found it blasphemous because she had been raised
  a loyal Catholic. But afterward, she had religious experiences
  regarding the content of that book which lead her to research
  Mary Magdalene and write "The Woman with the Alabaster Jar". She
  comes across as very rational, sensible and even heroic. It takes
  courage to contradict the dearly held beliefs of the majority. I
  thought Dan Burstein also made some very good points with his
  discussions about the lives and customs of Jewish people during
  the time Jesus lived. I think this dvd is an important reminder
  that just because you have been taught something all your life -
  that doesn't mean it is necessarily the truth. To be truly alive
  is to continue to search for the truth as long as you live</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">I saw this movie in the 1986 theatrical
  re-release and subsequently on DVD. I can readily attest that it
  does not age! I'm not even a dog person myself, but the plot is
  not about dogs per say, but the life adventures that a young
  cocker spaniel named Lady has. Living with owners named Darling
  and Jim Dear, Lady apparently leads a pretty good life. Assuming
  that every dog leads the good life she and her friends enjoy, she
  is later shocked to meet Tramp, who lives on the streets.
  However, she soon realizes that he has a good heart beneath that
  rough exterior. She needs his help when crusty old Aunt Sarah
  comes to mind the house--and the newborn baby. Initially not
  understanding that Lady feels protective towards the baby, she
  also selectively ignores the damage which her two Siamese cats
  were actually responsible for doing to that very elaborate
  Victorian house. Amazingly, Aunt Sarah presumes that Lady was
  responsible for wrecking the house--and attempts to muzzle her
  up! Like any streetwise character, Tramp has lots of connections
  and solutions to any problem which pops up. However, he does not
  come across as an annoying know-it-all who you would want to
  quickly get rid of. Tramp is instead somebody whom we are
  supposed to both identify and then want to hang out with in rough
  environments. Lady had 'gentle' friends named Jock and Trusty,
  but they can't help out in a world also outside of their own. Of
  course, the spaghetti dinner scene remains one of the most
  enduring of all time--it made a VERY profound impact on me well
  before I was even old enough to myself consider dating. I
  imagined that I would eventually share a romantic dinner of my
  own with my own "Mr. right". However, Tramp's decision to go
  after the rat in the nursery also remains a powerful scene. He
  then felt no loyalty to anybody in that family other than Lady,
  but saved the baby anyway! Tramp proved that class is not a
  matter of breeding but what you do with your self! Despite his
  earlier professed discomfort with collars, Tramp ultimately gets
  adopted by the Darlings. Therefore, he and Lady do in fact live
  happily ever after.</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">Attila was a 2001 mini series which won the
  honor of being the most watched mini-series of its day. It
  features a stellar cast including Powers Boothe as a crafty Roman
  leader who tries to use Attila to gain possession of Rome. Gerard
  Butler is Attila, the Hun,and he is everything about Attila in
  this role, never was an actor better suited. His character is
  sharp, passionate, determined and has an instant magnatism that
  keeps the viewer glued to the film. He brings a strong intensity
  and subtle gentleness to the character which makes watching him
  clash with Boothe even more dynamic. This is a definite watch for
  anyone that likes period piece drama or just really well staged
  war scenes</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">I'm still waiting for Poldark to make it
  across the pond. Until then, I'll satisfy myself with this fine
  work</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">I saw this movie for one reason: I wanted to
  see Gerard Butler in something other than Phantom Of The Opera
  just to see how he played a "normal" role. I've never been a big
  fan of "chick flicks" (for instance, my friend and I watched A
  Walk To Remember awhile ago, and the only thing that kept us from
  laughing throughout was the constant threat of being slapped by
  one of the girls in the room). That said, Dear Frankie is a
  thoroughly entertaining film that has a surprisingly deep plot
  and keeps going at a fast enough pace that you never get bored.
  Initially I had trouble understanding what the actors were saying
  (they all have thick accents), but once I got used to it I had no
  problems through the rest of the movie</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">Since "ER" debuted on NBC in 1994, it's
  taken the nation by storm. It's wonderfully produced by author
  Michael Chricton, a former surgeon before his writing career. For
  numerous years, it was the #1 drama series on television. The
  show starts with the cast of Anthony Edwards (Mark Greene),
  George Clooney (Doug Ross), Sherry Stringfield (Susan Lewis),
  Noah Wyle (John Carter), Julianna Margulies (Carol Hathaway), and
  Eriq La Salle (Peter Benton). It has since won and been nominated
  for several awards including Emmys. Its hospital action combined
  with personal drama always draws audiences deeply into every
  scene for every episode. Its emergency scenes grown in intensity
  and drama through the episodes. Season one introduces the
  everyday life in the ER in Chicago. Throughout, it explores many
  critical issues including Hathaway's self-destruction that
  results in a suicide attempt, Carter struggling as a medical
  student, Ross living his sex obsessed life, and others. Regular
  show viewers who haven't seen season one will see part of Lewis's
  reason for leaving Chicago in 1996, Greene in his first marriage
  and before Ella's birth (mother is Corday, who began in 1997),
  Deb Chin's (played by Ming Na) brief time in that ER as a medical
  student before returning as an official doctor in 2000, and many
  others. Such combination shows partially how the show's theme
  evolved to today. Episode by episode, the plot's quality stays on
  top. The overall scenery, through the physical environment to the
  emotional drama, never fails to compile the unforgettable viewing
  experience. Season two features the debuts of Gloria Reuben
  (Jeanie Boulet) and Laura Innes (Kerry Weaver, not an official
  cast member until season 3). This season explores Ross's most
  heroic act as a doctor, Carter becoming a doctor, Lewis being
  forced to care for her neice, and many more. Today's viewers who
  haven't seen season two will witness Boulet before testing
  positive for HIV, Weaver before realizing her lesbianism,
  Hathaway before her today's happy life (though now in Seattle),
  and others. This plot evolves very well in quality from the
  previous season. It continues its run of staying on top in
  critical care and drama. Both seasons feature wonderful acting
  from the entire cast. All add their own sense of individual theme
  into every scene. Through personal struggles, drama, and
  continually saving lives, everyone gives the show its unique
  viewing flavor. Such show quality makes "ER - The Complete First
  Two Seasons" worthy for all fans. This is sure to please its
  audiences. New viewers should watch these two seasons first.
  Otherwise, the plot will be confusing. Fans should watch for
  season 3 to be released on video in the near future</Text>

  <Text category="dvd">Mira Nair produced a film which is very
  entertaining, magical, and realistic in how it portrays the
  stresses and experiences associated with planning a modern
  wedding in India. The bride is a college educated beauty who has
  some liberated ideas and behaviors ... but she is also the the
  only daughter of her parents, a child of her culture. She agrees
  to an arranged marriage to the handsome son of a friend of the
  family... after a failed love affair (first secret in the film)
  from which she is not yet fully recovered. Aditi feels ready for
  marriage, so she tells her unmarried female cousin Ria who has
  some doubts about the matter. The unique traditions of the past
  are combined with modern touches - the past and present
  intertwine in unexpected ways to produce a beautiful and creative
  collage of whacky entertainment. The street scenes filmed in New
  Delhi symbolically represent the chaotic atmosphere, tensions and
  pressures of the preparations for a wedding. The plans are to
  create a joyous celebration ... to be remembered by both families
  ...and cherished for a lifetime. Family arrived from America,
  Dubai, and Australia ... to celebrate the blessed union of two
  young people in marriage. Lalit Verma, father of the bride takes
  his role seriously, his personality, character, and approach
  provide many of the comic and serious touches in the film. He
  displays extraordinairy sensitivity to a family tragedy that is
  unexpectedly revealed (the second secret) and takes courageous
  action to deal with the problem directly. He proves to be a
  caring, loving father whose integrity ensures the wedding
  preparations continue as planned, allowing nothing to mar the
  perfection of the moment. He even asks for a temporary loan from
  business associates to meet mmediate "cash flow" problems as the
  costs keep mounting upwards. The casting for all the roles are
  superb. The music was incorporated into the story of the film,
  enhancing and emphasizing the emotions in many scenes. There was
  spontaneous singing during the "mehndi" ceremony when the women
  paint henna designs on the hands of the bride. There was a
  haunting solo sung about the bride leaving the loving palace of
  her father ... to become a stranger to his house forever after
  marriage. Several enjoyable modern Indian techno sounds exploded
  throughout the film making the scenes more lively and enjoyable.
  Along with the wedding, there are several stories interwoven
  within the fabric of the film ... The first and most important
  one is how the wedding plans for Aditi and Hermant could have
  unravelled after Aditit confessed her secret affair to him. While
  the two large tents are built in the backyard, garlands of
  marigolds {"the flower of love") are woven, and the cost of
  water-proofing the tents is being negotiated - P.K. Dubey, the
  cell-phone carrying, dot.com business entrepeneur wedding event
  manager, and *bachelor* falls in love with Alice, the young maid
  and housekeeper for the Verma family. Meanwhile, Varun, Aditi's
  brother practices a dance he will perform at the 'sangeet'
  (engagement party?) with Ayesha, a very attractive cousin from
  Dubai. However, just before the party he clashes with his parents
  over his future educational plans. They decided he will be sent
  to a boarding school. Ayesha has been flirting with Rahul, a
  handsome young relative of the Verma's from Australia. They have
  even exchanged kisses in the dark. He had witnessed her dance
  sessions with Varun who now refuses to do the performance. When
  Rahul will not take Varun's place, one of the older ladies
  overhears and quotes poetry to him about his failure to rescue a
  lady in distress. She tells him straight up to get off his @ss
  ... Some of the most sensitive scenes include Ria, when she clues
  in on certain behaviors between Uncle Tej and Aleja, a young girl
  of about 6 or 7. Ria exposes Uncle Tej and at the same time
  reveals her own shame at having suffered a similar fate as a
  child. Lalit wrestles with how to handle this delicate situation.
  He couragously banishes Uncle Tej and his wife from his house.
  The wedding ceremony is a blessed and dignified event. It turns
  out to be perfect, a celebration of pure joy ... exactly as
  planned. Erika Borsos [pepper flower</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">This is an outstanding documentary of the
  campaign team that changed presidential campaigning. One does not
  need to love the results of these changes (I personally believe
  that this campaign was the beginning of the end of democracy as
  we know it, even as I marveled at the talent and loved the
  outcome of the election) to appreciate how Clinton's 1992
  campaign, as seen in this film, changed the American political
  world. "War Room" should be seen along with more recent
  documentaries (like, for example, "Staffers '04") to see the
  difference between a campaign that used techniques to achieve a
  goal and campaigns that use the same techniques as the goal (to
  be elected rather than to govern). Hopefully, it will encourage
  you to do what you can to return political campaigns to
  discussions of ideas rather than the useless, mind-numbing,
  dumbing down assessments of candidate traits (like "character" or
  "integrity") we seem to have resorted to in the past ten
  years</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">This original version is much funnier than
  U.S. version. The humor is dry and intelligent, and the
  characters are very complex: at times, you feel sorry for them;
  other times, you love them and laugh with them; and mostly, you
  think they're idiots. What a talented group of actors and
  comedians to create such a complexity of emotion in an audience.
  It's not often I can watch a DVD or series over and over, but
  this is one that I've enjoyed each time</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">We started with "There Goes a Dump Truck"
  which actually features a different "Dave." This first Dave was
  in the Dumptruck, Tractor and Farm Truck versions - maybe a few
  others - and is pretty unbearable for parents as far as how silly
  he is. The newer Dave (Dave Hood) is in all the rest (along with
  his sidekick, Becky, in some) and is much less goofy than the
  other Dave. I don't think the kids really care though...the
  sillier the better and my son loves them both. Anyway, I started
  with the dumptruck one when my son was almost 2 and he was
  immediately glued to the TV. I don't let him watch cartoons and
  try to limit overall TV to things that are at least somewhat
  informative/educational. As a result, he was never one to sit and
  watch much TV (made it hard for me to get things done!). But,
  with this series, he enjoyed watching the real live machines and
  vehicles (and some of the more goofy moments) so much. It really
  was a lifesaver at times. Needless to say it didn't take long for
  me to collect the entire series. I have watched them along with
  him and learned quite a bit about different occupations. My
  in-laws were farmers and really enjoyed watching the "Tractor"
  and "Farm Truck" versions with him. His favorites include "There
  goes a Firetruck," "There goes a Monster Truck" and "There goes a
  Spaceship." But, he literally rotates through all of them and has
  over the past year plus! I can't say enough good things about the
  video series as far as my son's enjoyment goes. Just don't look
  for any oscars for the acting and editing. It's pretty choppy,
  even for an amateur eye. I would highly recommend any in this
  series if your child likes any type of machine or vehicle.</Text>

  <Text category="dvd">All the great reviews written previously say
  it all - Anne of Green Gables the movie is a timeless classic of
  the classic novel. I've been watching this movie since I've been
  a child, and I still watch it as an adult. A movie like this
  doesn't need "special features" for it to be attractive as a
  DVD(Although the commentary is great!). Just the fact that no
  matter how long I keep this and how often I watch this movie, it
  won't change like VHS does.</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">Having visited St. Petersburg, Russia a year
  ago, I could not pass up the chance to watch this movie. I must
  say, it was nicely done. I can relate to the obnoxious, business
  like brother...who happily did not go with me on my trip. I was
  more like the care-free younger brother, but not quite so
  care-free as the character protrayed. The scenery was
  awesome...all the fantastic architecture of those magnificent
  buildings and sculptures were in the movie...although I wish
  there were more because the city is full of beauty. And this goes
  for the women as well!! I mainly went to see the city...but I
  also went there as a very confirmed bachlor to meet a lady that I
  planned would be my travel companion. What I didn't expect was to
  really fall in love :-). The BIG reason why I confirmed myself to
  be a life time bacholar was my exposure to American women...as if
  explained in the additional extras on the DVD...but the Russian
  lady that I met there and the culture of her up-bringing quickly
  changed my way of thinking!! One thing I should add though. The
  movie gave the impression that you can take her home with you
  when you go back to the states yourself. Such is not the case. It
  takes paperwork and a lot of patience to get her here...expect at
  least 8 months, but it is more like a year. It is time consuming
  to get her a US visa. But she was worth the wait for me and if
  you want a life long partner and lover, the wait is worthwhile.
  Another word of caution: Prepare yourself to fall in love with
  Russia...the people are very nice and I know of a lot of
  Americans who go there quite often to visit and re-visit...some
  even live there now</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">I saw this movie twice, the second time
  knowing exactly why I wanted to see it again. If you are trying
  to find out if you love someone or not, make sure that you see
  this movie. Such a simple but yet such a powerful definition of
  love it gives. Explains why we are where we are, and makes you
  part of the harmony. Is love as simple as teaching someone to
  bike? Think about it. If there are no rules against it, this film
  should be renominated for Oscar.</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">I remember watching this in high school. I
  thought it was great fun then and my kids think it still is now.
  Okay, we're not talking Academy award material here (Emmy?).
  Ralph, Bill, &amp;amp; Pam are back for the third and final
  season of this far too short series about a man who is given a
  suit by aliens that gives him super powers. He is teamed with an
  FBI agent to help the world survive itself. In the first few
  minutes Ralph looses the instruction book and must noodle out how
  to operate the suit. He runs into a few walls, literally. The
  first season was a little rough. The second season fleshed out
  the concept. This third season started to stretch its legs but
  the show was cancelled. I have looked for years for novels based
  on the show, to no avail. I even contacted Cannell to ask if I
  could write them. As Disney is half-heartedly working on a
  feature film based on the show Cannell wouldn't cut loose with
  permission. Alas, It would've been fun. Anyway, if you have the
  other two seasons you'll love this one. The only complaint/change
  I would make is having to play the theme song before each
  episode. I would've made it so you could hit the "forward to
  next" button and go right to the action. Also, the jacket plays a
  bit of the theme song. I wish they'd made it possible to change
  the batteries. Mike Hudspeth in St.Louis, Missour</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">This DVD gives a very good 60 minute
  workout. As others have pointed out the cardio is very dancy. The
  first time I did it, I felt a bit awkward with the steps, but
  when I did it the second time I was able to follow along with no
  problems. The dance moves are a fun change up from my usual
  routine. If someone like Denise Austin were leading this one, I
  don't think I would play along. Minna is by far my favorite
  instructor, so I go along with it and it ends up being a fun
  workout. I wouldn't want to do this every day, but it is good to
  have something different in the rotation. I think the toning
  section is excellent. I am not looking to bulk up. I just want my
  body to firm up and look better when I wear shorts and a tank
  top. I like how she combines upper and lower body exercises. It's
  easy to follow and you feel like you hit every muscle area in 30
  minutes. I use 3 pound weights at this point and I can see where
  in the future I might be buying 4 pound weights. Minna is a great
  instructor. She has excellent cueing and is very encouraging. She
  is never annoying. I also have her Optimizer- Balanced Blend DVD
  and I love that one.</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">When Kerouac, Ginsberg, and Burroughs set
  out in their writing, they had no idea what it would create - a
  whole movement. This film, including interviews taken when
  Ginsberg and Burroughs were alive, assembles clips from media,
  film, and personal account to show the beginnings of the beats up
  to the passing-away of Ginsberg and Burroughs. With a large
  assembly of other beat writers and the poets they influenced
  (Carroll and Bukowski), it is an extensive study to a
  misunderstood movement. It is interesting to see the Beat
  propaganda of the sixties, how negative and mocking the media
  treated the sense of a &amp;amp;quot;cool&amp;amp;quot; movement;
  they painted a false portrait. This film is for lovers of Beat or
  people genuinely interested. However, if you do not like
  documentaries, you won't like this one. Also, I was disappointed
  to see Depp, Hopper, and Turturro reciting long pieces of work
  when the actual writers could have performed it. Honestly, I
  skipped these parts. I wanted to see Ginsburg doing
  &amp;amp;quot;Howl.&amp;amp;quot; Another disappointment is the
  DVD version, which was slapped together on the fly. I envisioned
  additional clips and useful information (let's face it, you can
  put TONS on a DVD), but only had 2 or 3 screens of names credited
  for making the movie and the trailer (in this case, not
  exciting). However, with all disappointments aside, this film is
  good for a few viewings. It conveys a better picture of the Beats
  than other films have before and enjoyed alot of the
  material</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">Hello, fellow "Amazon'ers" out there in
  cyber-land :) I grew up in the MI TV series era. As a TV/DVD
  collector of primarily 60's-80's series and member of a couple of
  TV/DVD forums on the 'net, I can mention to all of the
  "Amazon'ers" out there that this is a gem that we've been wanting
  on DVD for years. As for some of the "Cruise" posts, I saw the
  1st MI film and, as others mentioned here, it's somewhat like
  comparing "apples and oranges". From a TV/DVD collectors point of
  view, we want the (TV-series remake) films released, since in a
  lot of cases, the studios will release the original TV/DVD series
  as a market "tie-in" coinciding with the film release. TV/DVD
  collectors may not purchase the film on DVD but in a lot of
  cases, the film "gets the job done" for the TV series release. My
  favorite season of this series was S1. I liked Steven Hill in the
  IMF Force Team Leader role just a little better than Peter Graves
  although I thought Graves did an outstanding job in the role
  after Hill left the series. I also liked the original script line
  of "Please dispose of this recording in the usual manner". :)
  What can we say about the "Landau/Bain" team on this show?
  Classic! And, what a casting jackpot for Greg Morris in the
  "tech/electronics genius" role :) This series is a must-buy for
  most of the TV/DVD collectors out there. It's simply-put, a "sure
  thing" gem for your collection. I only hope that additional
  seasons will make it to their release[s]. As the saying goes,
  "It's all about the #'s" (sales #'s). Hopefully, this set will
  sell well on the 'net stores and your local outlets. "As always,
  should any of your DVD's dislodge from their hubs in transit, the
  Shipper will disavow any knowledge of their existance". :)

  <Text category="dvd">I lived through the vietnam era. IF you did
  you can't ever forget. This guy was right in the middle of the
  crucial decisions that brought the debacle down on us. Here he
  sifts through the sands of his memory and tries to synthesize how
  it went wrong, why it went wrong and what we can learn to KEEP
  FROM REPEATING IT. For me, here was the most unforgettable
  moment. Decades later he returns to vietnam and winds up sitting
  at a formal dinner next to his north vietnamese counterpart from
  those days. Macnamara tells him we--the americans--were not a
  colonial power seeking to impose our will but were fighting to
  stop the spread of communism, seeing north vietnam as a tentacle
  of communist china. The north vietnamese official gaped at him
  and then began pounding the table and said, "Mr. Macnamara, you
  must have never read a history book! We've been FIGHTING the
  chinese for a thousand years! We aren't their puppet! We were
  fighting for our national freedom! We would have fought to the
  last man!" Macnamara says they almost came to blows. Here's the
  point. Macnamara says, as compared to say the soviets, we didn't
  understand the north vietnamese. We didn't really know enought
  about them. We had no idea what was in their minds. And that was
  why we wound up fighting the wrong war against the wrong country
  and for the wrong reasons! That's why we lost! Does any of this
  sound familiar?????? This is a fantastically good piece of work
  that ought to be required viewing for every american of voting
  age. It's that good and that informative. Of course, it won't be
  widely viewed by the american public. We'll go our goofy way
  coveting our big-screen tvs and gas guzzling cars and spending
  our time on important things--like sporting events</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">Barbershop is a rare event in
  African-American filmmaking. It's one of the few that actually
  tells a fairly accurate story of what life is like for
  African-Americans. I love the fact that the movie showed how
  diverse the African-American community is; we see black people
  from different walks of life and different lifestyles shown
  onscreen. I really liked this movie. We definitely need more
  films like this Calvin is the owner of a Chicago Barbershop
  passed on to him by his late father. Mired in debt from the shop
  and his crazy business schemes, Calvin is desperate to start
  something of his own and feels that the barbershop is a hindrance
  on his life. It's not until he sells the barbershop to a loan
  shark that he realizes the value of the shop to the community and
  sees a role for himself in the neighborhood. There are a dozen
  other stories that link to this main one and they're all easy to
  follow. One follows a stolen ATM machine, one follows the quest
  for love of an African immigrant, another follows a female barber
  and her cheating boyfriend, another follows a guy desperate for a
  haircut to go to a job interview, and yet another follows a white
  barber's quest for acceptance by the black barbers he works with.
  In a way, this film reminded me of those great ensemble movies
  like Pulp Fiction that follow many characters and their stories.
  Each of the stories lead up to the ending where Calvin saves the
  barbershop. Director Tim Story does a great job of capturing life
  in Chicago and the informal environment of the barbershop. I felt
  the spirit of the Windy City and the informal environment of the
  barbershop. Watching the conversations in the movie reminded me
  of the barbershop in Harlem my father used to take me to when I
  was a boy. It also reminded me of the charged atmosphere of the
  old barbershop I used to go to get my flat-top trimmed (Both are
  closed now.) :( There are a ton of great performances in this
  movie; I'm probably going to miss mentioning a few people. Ice
  Cube is great as Calvin. I liked his performance here. Michael
  Ealy stands out in his role as an ex-con trying to turn his life
  around by becoming a barber. Ealy makes you feel his characters'
  desperation. Cedric the Entertainer makes a breakthrough
  performance as an old barber. He's funny and poignant. Sean
  Nelson is great as an educated man who works as a barber while
  going to college. Anthony Anderson and Larenz Tate are hilarious
  as two bumbling thieves who steal an ATM with no money in it.
  Watching them try to open will make you laugh. Keith David is
  creepy as the loan shark. Then again, Keith David is always good
  in anything he does. I'd pay money to watch him and Sam Jackson
  read listings in the yellow pages. I don't know why Movie Critics
  and the Rev. Jesse Jackson denounced Barbershop, it's one of the
  best movies ever made about African-American life. Looking at the
  box office of Barbershop and Diary of a Mad Black Woman,
  African-Americans actually WANT more films like this. As a black
  moviegoer I want different black films that allow the world to
  see the whole community, not just one small part of it. I for one
  and tired of the "Hood" movies like Never Die Alone, and
  Critically acclaimed movies like Monster's Ball and Hustle
  &amp;amp; Flow that depict black life as something negative.
  (Thankfully, it seems the rest of the black community is tired of
  these types of movies too, the box office and DVD sales for them
  is declining while the box office for movies like Barbershop and
  Diary of a Mad Black woman are going up.) End of rant, back to
  the review. A Shawn James essential Five Star video. You must buy
  this movie. Get some friends together put the DVD in the machine,
  Pull up a chair and have a seat in front of the TV and hang out
  at the Barbershop.</Text>

  <Text category="dvd">The caribou population is declining at an
  alarming rate and the Canadian government is concerned. After a
  harrowing and kind of funny plane flight with tundra pilot Brian
  Dennehy government researcher Tyler is dropped in the frozen
  middle of nowhere. It's a `kind of' funny plane flight because
  it's so well done. Dennehy is a hung over, buckaroo bonzai type
  independent flyer. His little prop plane, heavily laden with
  Tyler's (Charles Martin Smith) equipment, has a tough time both
  taking off and, later, staying afloat. The in-flight repairs
  Dennehy makes had me on the edge of my seat - although the
  photography is the great strength of NEVER CRY WOLF, the acting -
  especially by Smith - and the editing are also nearly perfect. As
  harrowing as the plane ride is it's a pretty safe bet the plane
  will land (elsewise there'd be no movie) and Tyler will find
  survival, rather than research, is the pressing order of
  business. Tyler is there to locate a wild wolf pack, kill one or
  two of the pack members, and dissect them to discover if, as
  suspected, their stomachs contain an inordinate amount of healthy
  caribou meat. Tyler, laden with crates of light bulbs and toilet
  paper, is materially and constitutionally unprepared for setting
  up a research station on his own. Fortunately for him he'll be
  discovered, rescued, and befriended by two Inuits - the ancient
  Ootek (Zachary Ittimangnaq) and his adopted son, Mike (Samson
  Jonah.) As Tyler notes in his voice-over narration, there are no
  orphans among the Inuit. Ootek and Mike will arrive and disappear
  a few times, a wolf pack will be found, and Tyler will learn that
  man's relationship to the wolf is many times more complex than he
  imagined. I dislike most message movies. They tend to distort
  characters and events, and beat you over the head until you
  accept their point of view. NEVER CRY WOLF has a strong message
  about man and nature, but it's such an entertaining movie I
  didn't feel like I needed to join the Sierra Club to enjoy it.
  The story lines are clear, and after the plane trip its plentiful
  humor is quiet and unforced. Smith, who spends an awful lot of
  the movie alone, acting under his voice-over narration, is
  nuanced and convincing. Jorah and, especially, Ittimangnaq, are
  both good and both add a layer of authenticity to the film. And
  the photography is at times breathtaking. NEVER CRY WOLF is a
  gem.</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">"The Changeling" has become a little bit
  dated, however, it is still a very good ghost story. The film
  stars (George C. Scott) as John Russell, a composer who has lost
  his family in a tragic accident. He rents a large estate in order
  to compose his music. It is here that he encounters the ghost of
  a young boy. Why is the boy haunting the estate? Why is he making
  contact with John Russell? As the film moves forward, John
  Russell contacts a medium and eventually begins to investigate
  the mansion. From what he can gather, it was the former home of
  Senator Carmichael (Melvin Douglas). What ensues is the mystery
  of who the child is, and who is Senator Carmichael. What occurred
  in the mansion that is keeping this child there? This is more of
  a mystery than a horror film. The suspense of the film is through
  the nuances the director created by use of creepy sounds and
  effects in which the boy's wheelchair moves. The film is dated,
  and does not have the appeal it once had for me, however, it is
  still a good watch. Recommended.</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">Audrey, without Givenchy, and only a portion
  of her face visible, few lines and much conflict gives one of the
  great performances. The depth of the movie, the richness, amount
  to a great piece of art. Certainly, the movie is not "fun," but
  it attests to a time when a movie about the struggle with faith
  could be a blockbuster</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">Disney made its mark as a major studio in
  1937 with its first full-length feature film, Snow White and the
  Seven Dwarves. Ironically, given this early success, Snow White
  was their only hit movie for the next 13 years. World War II
  kicked the hell out of Disney's overseas markets. Even movies
  today regarded as classic Disney - Pinnochio, Bambi, Fantasia -
  lost money on initial release. Disney eked through by
  diversifying into training films for the US government, and the
  South American films that were part of FDR's Good Neighbor
  policy, etc. - stuff that made back its costs but not much more.
  By 1948, Disney was in dire financial straits. They had just
  enough money for one more movie. Walt Disney realized he needed a
  hit or his studio probably wouldn't survive, and it would have to
  be what they did best: a full-length animated feature film. Walt
  said to himself, "What we need is a movie about a girl in
  trouble. Audiences love that. They loved Snow White." That's what
  he wanted: a movie like Snow White, but even more so - more
  comedy, more drama, more magic, more music, more lovable
  characters. He chose as the basis of his company's Hail Mary pass
  arguably the most famous fairy tale in the world: Cinderella.
  Disney didn't have the money, as they had on earlier films, to
  lavishly storyboard every scene. Thus they hit upon the
  wonderfully clever idea of shooting the entire movie in live
  action, then the animators used stills from that as storyboards.
  The photos used survive to this day, and many are provided as a
  Special Edition "extra." In some cases these photos have the
  animator's drawings over them, turning for instance an almost
  bare stage into a hall in Cinderella's family chateau. In 1950,
  Cinderella was released and was everything Disney so desperately
  needed. Even today, Cinderella is arguably the best movie
  Disney's ever made. It's just awfully hard to argue with any
  aspect of this film. The animation artwork was a product of
  Disney's famous "Nine Old Men" - at that time not yet old.
  Cinderella pulls off, superbly, something not particularly easy
  to do: it integrates believable human characters with funny
  cartoon animals and makes it work. From Eric Larson and Marc
  Davis' beautiful and graceful Cinderella to Ward Kimball's
  wonderful Jaq and Gus-Gus the mice and over-the-top Lucifer the
  cat, everything flows together so well it all seems perfectly
  natural. Part of Walt Disney's plan to out-Snow White Snow White
  with Cinderella involved its music. He very consciously wanted
  Cinderella to be a source of hit songs. There had been hit songs
  from Disney films before ("Heigh Ho" and "Whistle While You Work"
  from Snow White, "When You Wish Upon a Star" from Pinnochio,
  etc.) but they'd been almost accidental. "Oh, we have a hit song,
  well that's nice." For Cinderella, Disney for the first time went
  to Tin Pan Alley (28th Street in New York City where the
  professional songwriters could be found). Disney wanted his
  girl's music done by the very best craftsmen, the guys who wrote
  hit songs for a living. The Cinderella soundtrack hit big (a #1
  album with 3/4 million units sold) with songs even today
  considered quintessential Disney, most notably "A Dream is a Wish
  Your Heart Makes" from the movie's opening scene, "The Work Song"
  while the animals help Cinderella clean the house and
  simultaneously build her ball gown, and "Bibbidi-Bobbidi-Boo"
  (nominated for an Academy Award as best movie song of the year)
  from the Fairy Godmother transformation scene. For their best
  movie, Disney apparently spared no expense producing the DVD. Not
  only has the picture quality been digitally restored, but the
  audio has also been cleaned up with a new 5.1 surround sound mix.
  Totally gone is the background hiss associated with so many old
  movies. (Cinderella has the distinction of being "the noisiest
  movie ever restored" according to its audio crew.) The original
  mono soundtrack has also been spruced and is provided as an
  option for purists. A word about the movie's aspect ratio (i.e.
  how wide the picture is compared to its height). The DVD cover
  says Cinderella is presented in its "Original Full-Screen Aspect
  Ratio (1.33:1)". This is untrue. Virtually all sound films until
  1953, including Cinderella, were 1.37:1. Since a TV screen is
  1.33:1, you don't lose a lot when the original is "formatted to
  fit your television." I just wish they hadn't lied about it.
  Cinderella ends at breakneck pace: we go straight from her foot
  sliding into the glass slipper to the wedding to Happily Ever
  After, bing, bang, boom. Walt Disney believed "Audiences like a
  happy ending, but they don't like a happy ending that goes on too
  long." Hey, who am I to argue? Well, maybe I'll argue. A DVD
  extra addresses scenes originally planned for the movie but not
  actually used. One of these would have occurred after the fitting
  of the glass slipper and before the wedding: Cinderella is taken
  by the Grand Duke to the castle in her normal everyday clothes;
  the first time Prince Charming sees her since the ball she's not
  wearing a lovely gown, she's wearing her scullery maid outfit.
  Cinderella is frightened, how will he react when he realizes
  she's not a fine lady but a poor servant girl? And of course he
  doesn't care how she's dressed, he loves her anyway. I can
  **see** that scene in my mind, it would have worked beautifully.
  This is the one way in which an almost perfect movie could have
  been even a tiny bit better</Text>

  <Text category="dvd">They just don't have movies like this
  anymore. This is not a movie that makes Charlie Sheen or Tom
  Berenger appeal to the young audiences who like flashy stars on
  sceen. This is amovie to show you the reality of war and
  experiences that happened to people in the past. Charlie Sheen
  stars as a man who volutarily goes to war. This seems odd and he
  figures out why everyone was looking at him so weird when he was
  telling them this later in the movie. He finds out alright. Keith
  David plays his friend who tries to keep his spirits up and this
  is definitely his best role. He cheers him up in a great scene
  where they get extremely baked. The supporting cast in this movie
  is unbelievable and no flat performances here. Overall this is my
  favorite movie of all time. It has stood the test of time and
  never fails when I want to see a good movie. I just have the old
  special edition, not the 20th anniversary but the extras are very
  nice. It has a commentary from the direcotor and a seperate one
  from the military advisor who worked on the film. There is also a
  lengthy doumentary about the making of and when I saw this I was
  mroe than glad I got the special edition. You would nto believe

  <Text category="dvd">My kids (age 5, 7 and 10) love this movie. I
  actually bought the VHS version many years ago when the movie
  first came out but wanted the DVD so we could watch it in the car
  when while traveling. My husband and I originally bought this
  movie for my little nephew to watch so it's nice that we can
  share it with our own kids now. If you love animals, this movie
  is for you. The DVD jacket says this movie took a few years to
  make and I believe it. It's absolutely amazing how the animals
  relate to each other. This has got to be one of the best animal
  films out there.</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">Not a fan of graphic novels or CGI, I was
  fully prepared to dislike this movie, but found it to be so well
  written, cast and shot that I will no doubt buy it for my
  collection. It's a dark movie, subversive really, but carries a
  strong message that tyranny will not long survive the will of the
  people, that one strong person with a will, determination and the
  cleverness to use the tools of the corrupt against them, can turn
  the tide. It's a powerful message, and it's beautifully displayed
  with imaginative imagery, symbolism and script. Bravo</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">Based on the bestselling novels by Michael

  most exciting and realistic Civil War battle sequences ever put
  on screen. The acting is phenomenal, with the likes of Jeff
  Daniels, Stephen Lang, Tom Berenger, Robert Duvall, Bruce
  Boxleitner, Martin Sheen, Richard Jordan, Sam Elliott and Mira
  Sorvino, but to name a few of the fine actors and actresses in
  these two movies. Director Ronald F. Maxwell has created a

  <Text category="dvd">I really like this DVD - you can get some
  really good exercise in only 10 minutes. Lara does not waste time
  on lengthy explanations between exercises, and she moves quickly
  from one exercise to another. I like the variety of exercises -
  there are not too many rep's on any one exercise, which keeps the
  workout from being monotonous. This is the first "programmable"
  exercise DVD I've used, and I like being able to pick and choose
  which exercise segments to do and in which order - this makes it
  easier for me to get motivated to start (and once I start, I'm
  fine)</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">The movies of course are dated, but
  fascinating also. The picture quality was excellent as was the
  sound. The main iterest was in seing how much movie stories have
  changed. Now even the simplest movie, regardless of the subject
  has an edge. These "horror" movies of the 40s-50s are gentler,
  less scary, with a clear statement of good and evil. Now we view
  things differently without any absolute judgments. Clarity has
  given way to a more unsettled world</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">I am a faithful CSI watcher, and have been
  since the shows inception. I buy the DVD sets and enjoy them
  tremendously. However, there are two trends I see developing that
  I don't care for---one, there is too much Catherine. We know
  everything about her kid, her dead husband, her crook father,
  etc., and she's really an annoying character. She makes nasty
  comments about everyone; she's always being insubordinate; she
  goes out with men half her age (let's quit trying to make her
  seem like a young chick when she isn't, especially wearing those
  skin tight jeans), she is very arrogant, and even though she
  continually screws up (loses her camera; blows up the lab in a
  previous season, accuses people before she has all the evidence),
  they made her a supervisor. Also, the plot line with Grissom and
  Sara, while predictable, is not the greatest. I think Grissom
  would be better off paired with Lady Heather. There's an idea!
  Let's see more of Lady Heather. Still, even with the annoying
  overabundance of the least likable character (Catherine), the
  show is one of the best, if not THE best, on TV (up there with
  Without a Trace, NCIS and Numbers). Keep 'em coming</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">The Freshman is a very funny movie. The
  central joke is that Marlon Brando plays a godfather type figure
  in lower Manhattan who for obvious reasons looks exactly like the
  titular character Brando so famously portrayed. Matthew Broderick
  is the freshman, an innocent NYU film student, who through some
  comedic misadventures gets involved with Brando and his "family".
  The funniest scenes involve a Komodo dragon loose in a New Jersey
  shopping mall though the whole film is a delightful comedy. The
  movie has no real violence and though there are a few mild "bad"
  words the movie is fairly appropriate for viewing by older kids
  and families.</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets",
  the second Harry Potter film in the series, was the first bit of
  the Harry Potter phenomenon I was every exposed to. I'd kind of
  avoided the boy wizard before then, but after seeing it those
  couple of years ago, even though I didn't entirely follow what
  was what and who was who, I realized it was pretty entertaining.
  After reading the second book recently, I picked up the DVD and
  watched it again. The series gets a little darker, like the books
  do, but unlike the book, I don't think the jump is as large,
  which I reckon is a good thing. Though I prefer the first film,
  it's still good to watch. It's Harry's (Daniel Radcliffe's)
  second year at Hogwart's wizards school, and after a shaky
  summer, he returns to find himself in the midst of a sinister
  plot. It seems a certain Heir of Slytherin has opened the
  legendary Chamber of Secrets, loosing a monster that is wandering
  about petrifing students, literally! Many fingers point to Harry,
  Harry's finger points to Malfoy, and Ron's wand... well that
  doesn't point at all, as its broken and backfiring. What's this
  all got to do with the mysterious trails spiders, haunted
  toilets, a rogue Quidditch bludger and a self-flagellating house
  elf? Can Harry, Ron and Hermione figure things out? All the kids
  are a little bit older and a little bit wiser in this film, plus
  the boys' voices are breaking. In some scenes they're kind of
  croaky sounding, in other scenes they have their child voice, and
  in others their voices broken through, not neccesarily in that
  order. There's a couple of new kids, (like Colin Creevey) and
  they are just as well cast as the others. The new adults are well
  cast too. Though not my favorite performance of his career,
  Shakespearean actor Kenneth Branagh makes an interesting Gilderoy
  Lockhart, the vain second year dark arts teacher. He played it a
  lot more subtley than I expected him to. Ex-Fast Show comedian
  Mark Williams plays Mr Weasley, which I reckon was a great
  choice. I missed some of the cast from the last film though. You
  hardly see Warwick Davis (who plays Professor Flitwick), let
  alone hear him say anything, and John Cleese's Nearly Headless
  Nick, who has a rather significant deathday party in the book,
  has hardly anything to do here except get petrified. There were
  other things cut out too, like the catching of the garden gnomes
  at the Weasley's. The fans of the book will feel the absence more
  than the casual viewers though. Personally, I like to think of
  the Harry Potter films as illustrations to the books put into
  motion, rather like the pictures in the world of Hogwarts. They
  give an idea of what the book would look like, an impression.
  Special features include an interview with author J.K. Rowling
  and script writer Steve Kloves, as well as interviews with all
  the kids and all the main adult actors. There's also slick
  virtual tours through Diagon Alley, Dumbledore's Office and
  Gilderoy Lockhart's Classroom (a tour that turns out to be just
  as pretentious as he is, complete with gushing praises from the
  narrator). There's also a couple of games: you can visit the
  Chamber of Secrets after answering some Harry Potter trivia, you
  can drive the flying car through the forbidden forest (which I
  found frustrating but addictive). There's also a trivia game
  about what spell does what too. Unlike the first DVD, you don't
  have to beat any games to access the deleted scenes, you're able
  to go to them straight from the main menu. Just as well, there's
  19 of them, and some of them are pretty significant. Notable
  scenes include Harry's close encounter with the Malfoys in the
  dark magic shop, Harry discovering that Filch is taking wizard
  lessons by correspondence. I wish they'd left some of these
  scenes in, particularly the ones where Harry Potter questions his
  nature, is he a good wizard or a bad wizard. That was some mighty
  fine character development cut there! There's also a gallery of
  design drawings and a section called "Colin Creevey's Darkroom"
  where you can select pictures of various characters, then play
  them in a slideshow of sorts. Apparently there's a whole stack of
  stuff in the DVD ROM features, but I just couldn't get them to
  work on my laptop's DVD drive. Using InterActual player (the
  player that many Warner Brothers films have you install to play
  their DVDs), it says there is a script error, and when I tried
  Windows Media Player 9 and Cyberlink PowerDVD 4.0, though it ran
  the DVD and everything else with it fine, the DVD acted as if it
  wasn't in a DVD ROM drive, telling me that if I put the DVD into
  my PC's drive I'd get all these wonderful features. It was in my
  DVD drive! Aggh! It IS in a DVD drive. Maybe its just my type of
  laptop (BenQ DH5100U, 1.5 Gigahertz). Ah well, it looked like it
  would have been really fun, especially for fans of the series.
  All in all, its definitely worth a look for Harry Potter fans,
  but I would recommend you read the book first</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">I saw this show on Logo. Boy I loved it. I
  wish I was there</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">Watching this movie is a very bizarre
  experience. Having attended high school in the countryside, close
  to large clusters of Amish farms, I had heard stories from my
  friends at school about rumspringing Amish teenagers. I dismissed
  most of them as rumor. This movie confirmed that those wild
  stories I heard were probably true. A very intruiging look at the
  flipside of a lifestyle most Americans cannot even begin to
  comprehend. Worth a rental at the very least</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">Bob Clark's 1974 chiller classic, which went
  on to inspire many elements of "Halloween" and "When a Stranger
  Calls", is definitely one of the better, if not best, horror
  films out there. Period. Not high on blood, but very high on
  suspense, dread, atmosphere, and out-of-the-dark surprises. A
  sorority house (to include the lovely Olivia Hussey, the vulgar
  alcoholic Margot Kidder, and SCTV vet Andrea Martin) falls victim
  to vicious, violent, and altogether menacing phone calls during
  the Christmas holidays. Soon, students on campus begin turning up
  missing. Though some events do go unexplained (which could be
  positive, considering the mystery involved) and the film tends to
  go borderline predictable in some sorts, this is undeniably one
  of the creepiest horror films, with the most tense, moody
  photography ever captured on film. Keir Dullea and Margot Kidder
  turn in quite effective performances. Highly recommended</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">My six year old (who has NEVER been very
  excited about exercise) really loves this DVD. The routine is
  active, fun and most importantly easy to learn. Other videos have
  simply left her frustrated when the routine was complicated or
  very little instruction was offered. She completed the workout
  the first day and when she woke up the next morning, she asked to
  do it again! My 2 1/2 year old has a great time "dancing" with us

  <Text category="dvd">House 1 is darker than it's sequels but stll
  maintains the horror/comedy feel throughout. Don't expect to be
  blown away by outlandish Hollywood special effects. The majority
  of the special effects are not special. But if you can get over
  that, you'll enjoy the movie. DVD is pretty bare bones with no
  amazing special features. I doubt much of that was available due
  to the age of the film. I'm just happy it was released on DVD! If
  you are a fan of low budget horror/comedy movies this movie may
  appeal to you. It's no Evil Dead, but it is an entertaining

  <Text category="dvd">This movie is asome its one of my favorites
  from the 90's and probably my favorite plot twister/ who done it
  along with M night shamylans films. this movies great plot is
  over looked by the average americans craving desire of sex and
  scandal which is retarded and makes this country alittle less
  than great. anyway the shear sex appeal is also one of the tones
  that makes this movies atomasphere so great the music hits it
  perfect and the 2 leads are my favorite younger actress' neve
  campbell and Denise richards who are both perfect for they're
  rolls. The whole movie is just oozing with sex appeal that
  combined with the story makes it irresistable. which is
  unexpected from john Mcnaughton as it was his first big claim to
  fame film. bill murray adds some much needed comic releif and the
  plot will keep you guessing till the end and will fool anyone
  even those retards from CSI. The 2 girls have "it" in theyre
  rolls they just seem to fit together like a sexy peanut butter
  and jelly sandwhich. I was fist drawn to this film ever since i
  meet Matt Dillon at universal studios he was just asome and i had
  to see him act, and everyone recommended this movie for that and
  he was asome in it to. infact i wouldnt mind meeting the whole
  cast all of them are huge idols of mine and theyre all so cool. i
  do miss neve campbell.. i wish she'd come back to films and it
  looks like she will. so if your looking for a once in a lifetime
  plot and an asome cast this movie has it or if your like the
  99.9% of people who have seen this and you only like it for the
  threesome and the pool scenes then i guess its good for that to
  since ive only seen the editied verison. Ps dont waste ur time
  with the other sequals theyre stupid and repeats of this one with
  not so famous casts. take a look at the fist still at the bottom
  it sums up the whole "it" thing i was taking about you just feel
  an incredible amount of "cool" form that shoot, well i did
  anyway</Text>

  <Text category="dvd">Great movie! Delivery of the order came in
  good time. This 2-Disc Collector's Edition comes with some
  interesting extras. I found the offtakes/blubbers to be in bad
  taste, but the rest of the extras were worth seeing. Personnally
  I would avoid watching the extras that describe the making of the
  movie. Although it is interesting to watch, especially for those
  wanting to go into the movie making business, I find that it then
  takes away from the enjoyment of watching the movie itself. Just
  my personal preference. No doubt others will have different
  opinions</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">Until Sam Raimi made Spider-Man, I think we
  all regarded Tim Burton's Batman as the best superhero movie
  (even though I actually don't consider Batman to be a "superhero"
  because he has no superpowers). Burton directed this movie, and
  did a great job - this movie looks like it takes place in the
  1920s, except that society is a lot more technologically advanced
  than it really was back then. Michael Keaton is Batman/Bruce
  Wayne. Needless to say, Batman is Wayne's alter ego. Keaton is
  magnificent at playing the character's alter ego. Keaton also
  does a good job playing the character when he's not in costume.
  Keaton's Bruce Wayne isn't as gloomy as Christian Bale's was in
  Batman Begins, which isn't necessarily a bad thing. But I would
  say Bruce Wayne was a little too cheerful for my liking in the
  Schumacher movies. But overall, Bale's Bruce Wayne is superior to
  Keaton's because Bale has a much more developed character to
  play. HOWEVER, Keaton plays a better costumed Batman than Bale.
  The problem with this movie is that the Joker (Jack Nicholson)
  steals the show - the whole movie revolves around him, so this
  isn't Batman's movie. This movie should have been called "The
  Joker." So if you ever wondered why Nicholson got a higher
  billing than Keaton, now you know. The thing is, the writers
  never bothered to give Bruce Wayne a personality, and they barely
  scratch the surface of the character's background - we know
  practically nothing about Wayne. You'd think the guy that's
  Batman wouldn't be so uninteresting, but we're bored to tears
  everytime Wayne's onscreen (and out of costume). But when Keaton
  is onscreen in the Batman costume, Batman seems so menacing and
  captivating that you enjoy all of his scenes. He plays an even
  more menacing Batman than Bale - so I say that Keaton does a
  better Batman than Bale, but that Bale does a better Bruce Wayne
  than Keaton. But Keaton didn't have anything to work with, so
  it's not his fault his Bruce Wayne is so weak. But one of the
  strengths of Keaton's performance is that if you ever met Wayne,
  he'd seem like the last guy in the World that could be Batman.
  That's something Kilmer and Clooney failed to accomplish, but
  thankfully Bale was able to do it. Michael Gough is a delight as
  the old butler Alfred. It's hard to believe Gough was a villain
  in so many horror movies over the years. I assumed Michael
  Caine's Alfred wouldn't compare to Gough's, but I was wrong -
  they're both great. Pat Hingle was really good (as Commissioner
  Gordon) in this movie. Hingle and Gough were in all four movies
  of the original series, and I enjoyed them both in Batman
  Returns. But in Batman Forever I didn't like them nearly as much,
  and in Batman &amp;amp; Robin I found their characters annoying
  as hell. Vicki Vale's (Kim Basinger) investigation into Bruce
  Wayne's background is completely uninteresting. But I already
  knew what she would find out, so maybe that's why I didn't like
  those scenes. I also found the Vicki character annoying,
  screaming in terror every three seconds she was onscreen. There's
  lots of little things I love in this movie. The sight of Batman
  rising off the ground after the two muggers shoot him, (and the
  terrified expression of the gunmen) with Elfman's dramatic music
  blaring. The look on Napier's face when he sees the emptied safe.
  When the guy got fried by the Joker's joy-buzzer (one of the
  worst deaths I've ever seen in a movie). When the mimes close in
  on the press conference and unleash a surprise, and the Joker's
  speech right before a mob boss dies. The first Action News report
  of the movie. The way "URGENT" is written in messy crayon on the
  parcel. When Batman jumps through the skylight (accompanied by
  Elfman's music). The design of the Batmobile - minor changes make
  the car even cooler in Batman Returns. When the Batmobile speeds
  toward the Batcave (again, Elfman's music is awesome). The grin
  on the young Jack Napier. The Batmobile attacking the chemical
  factory. The Joker's facial expressions when he speaks in the
  microphone right after throwing lots of money to the crowd. When
  the bat signal is lit - but it's not as awesome as the first time
  it's lit in Batman Returns, or when it's lit at the end of Mask
  of the Phantasm. And now a few complaints. This movie featured
  too many songs by Prince. After a while, they get unbearably
  annoying. There were lots of other great `80s pop songs that
  could have (and should have) been used in this movie. Another
  thing is the Joker seems completely helpless without his goons to
  back him up. So I found the final showdown at the bell tower a
  little boring. By the way, you can tell that Nicholson's make-up
  job would look a lot more realistic in this day and age of
  filmmaking. Burton's Batwing is cooler than Schumacher's Batwing
  (but not as cool as the one in Mask of the Phantasm). Anyway, the
  targeting system of Burton's Batwing seems a little screwed up -
  Batman has a big red target locked on the Joker, but the plane's
  missiles and machine guns miss their target. And the Joker didn't
  even try to get out of the way! Looks like Batman paid the price
  of designing his own weapon systems. I always overlooked this
  movie's flaws (until I saw Batman Begins) for two reasons. First
  of all, I found Keaton's Batman to be so cool and the Joker to be
  so entertaining that I ABSOLUTELY LOVED this movie. Second of
  all, the poor quality of the sequels make this movie seem a lot
  better than it really is. Pretty much everytime the Joker or the
  Batman aren't onscreen, the movie is boring. But I must say that
  Batman was even cooler in Batman Returns than he was in this
  movie - and nastier.</Text>

  <Text category="dvd">Sometimes I wonder how it is we don't live
  in a vigilante society. People do such awful things and alot of
  times the system really can't/don't do anything for the victims.
  Well, in this film, this family was not going to just sit there
  and let the system dictate how their son's killer would be dealt
  with. Story takes place in a small town where the Strout family
  is a big deal. You know the family that everyone in the community
  knows and basically the money makers. There is also the Fowler
  family which also make their way in the town. She is a folk song
  teacher and the father is a doctor and they have 1 college age
  son, Frank, that is dating an older woman (Marisa Tomei) and she
  has 2 sons. Well, the Strout family's son is married to Marisa
  Tomei and is not dealing well with the fact that she is dating
  the college boy and they aren't even divorced yet. Can't say that
  I blame him there, but it is inherent that he is a real prick and
  probably treated her and their sons poorly. Moving along, the
  Strout's son kills Frank and because of the Strout's clout and
  the fact that the ex wife didn't actually see him fire the shot,
  he is going to get off with manslaughter. This does not sit well
  with the Fowler's. The Fowler's have a friend that has over 300
  acres of land, so you can only imagine what happens. I certainly
  don't condone vigilantism, however, I just loved the ending. The
  Strout family put up property and funds to cover his bail, so
  since it appeared that he jumped bail, they will lose all of
  that. Beautiful! Then, they were able to get some pleasure from
  the fact that they will never have to see that jerk again roaming
  the streets. I couldn't help but get some satisfaction out of
  that myself. Very real and very interesting. Great movie</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">Jackie Chan and Chris Tucker deliver once
  again in this follow-up to their great film "Rush Hour". This
  film follows on the premise of the first, with a bit of a
  reversal....this time Tucker is the fish out of water in Chan's
  Hong Kong. As with my review of Rush Hour, I'll say up front that
  if youre looking for anything more than a fun-filled actioner,
  then this movie wont please you. It breaks no new ground and the
  plot is quite formulaic, but if you're looking for deep drama and
  character development...what are you doing watching a Chris
  Tucker movie? Watch for a great cameo by Don Cheadle as a black
  man married to an asian woman who owns and runs a Chinese Soul
  Food restaurant in a black section of Los Angeles. That alone is
  worth a laugh. There is another stand-out cameo by Jeremy Piven
  as a gay clothing store clerk who mistakes them for a couple. Be
  sure to watch the end credits and catch all of Piven's ad-libbed
  outtakes that ended up on the cutting room floor. But then, as
  with all Jackie Chan films, half the fun is watching the flubs
  during the end credits</Text>

  <Text category="dvd">"When was the last time you actually bought
  a ticket to see a movie, you actually paid your own money to see
  it?" "Last night, Pasedena. The Bicycle Thief." "It's an art
  movie. It doesn't count. We're talking about movie movies."
  Robert Altman is one of my favorite directors, mainly for the way
  he finds insight in the most inane actions or phrases. This short
  exchange has many layers when taken out of context and many more
  when taken in context. With this dialog, The Player reveals
  exactly why Hollywood movies don't make the money they should.
  Not because they don't make quality films, but because when a
  good movie does make money, it doesn't count because it's not a
  "movie movie." If he stopped to really listen to what was being
  said, he would've seen that art films have a great drawing power
  and actually don't cost much to make. But people still wonder why
  the modern film industry is suffering. Wait, there's more. The
  people in the room don't know it, but producer Griffin Mill, in a
  fit of paranoia, killed an unemployed screenwriter outside the
  theater that night. He was being stalked by a writer, but he
  blamed (and murdered) the wrong one. Now he's still being
  stalked, still in danger of losing his job, and the cops suspect
  him of murder. Not a good week for Mister Mill. As the
  conversation presses on, Mill's potential replacement passes
  around a newspaper, telling people to read random headlines to be
  made into scripts. Mill spots the story on his murder which we're
  already watching play out in a movie. Yes, it's that type of
  movie, the self-referential Hollywood movie about Hollywood
  movies that keeps teasing itself for the viewers' enjoyment.
  We've seen it about a thousand times before (or since): Get
  Shorty, Adaptation, Wes Craven's New Nightmare, even certain
  elements of 8 1/2. There's really nothing too special about it,
  but this one has much more subtlety and is much more believable.
  Pay close attention to the ending scene, and think about what
  words they're using opposed to what they're really saying.
  There's really only one word for a film like this:

  <Text category="dvd">The beautiful young Brooke Shields plays
  11/12 year old Violet, daughter of Hattie (Susan Sarandon) a New
  Orleans prostitute living and working in a brothel in 1917.
  Violet has been raised in the brothel and has not been to school
  and has known no other life or anything about the outside world.
  When she turns 12, her virginity is auctioned off. Brooke
  Shields' portrayal of Violet is poignant and beautiful. Her
  childish charms and innocence are so heart-wrenchingly sweet. The
  scene where she jumps up and down on the photographer's bed (very
  childlike) and asks him whether he will take care of her before
  throwing her arms around him and giving him small childlike
  kisses on the nose, forehead etc. and reciting that little rhyme
  really pulled at my heart strings! I just wanted to jump into the
  TV and give her a hug!! This, mixed with the seductive adult
  things that she also says in this scene (and others) is
  particularly poignant as we know that young Violet is merely
  reciting what she's heard from the prostitutes. The photographer
  also says that Violet doesn't know what she's saying. You just
  want to turn the clock back, hug Violet and give her a proper
  childhood! The photographer marries her because he's fascinated
  with her beauty, innocence and is concerned that she is only a
  child and should not be in a brothel becoming a prostitute. The
  part where he gives her a doll is poignant as she has already
  lost her virginity and it seems that he's trying to give back her
  childhood, sadly she's been exposed to too much, too soon in her
  life. Susan Sarandon and Brooke Shields are wonderful in this
  movie as well as Keith Carradine, the photographer. The art
  aspect &amp;amp; music soundtrack are amazing. This movie deals
  with a taboo subject seen through the eyes of a child as 'normal'
  which enhances poignancy and brings out the viewers maternal need
  to 'rescue' young Violet.</Text>

  <Text category="dvd">This is a highly entertaining film with an
  incredibly minimalist screenplay that succeeds beyond all
  expectations. This film's strengths are its characters and the
  actors that portray them. Sean Connery plays Captain Marko Ramius
  with great bravado and charisma relying greatly on his
  mesmerizing screen presence to maneuver the entire direction of
  this film. Tim Curry is amusing as the dutiful Dr. Petrov in a
  role well suited for him. The rest of the cast balances out the
  histrionics of Sean Connery and Tim Curry with realistic and
  convincing performances to bring authenticity and realism to the
  drama of this film. Alec Baldwin as Jack Ryan, James Earl Jones
  as Admiral James Greer, Sam Neill as Captain Vasily Borodin,
  Scott Glenn as Commander Bart Mancuso, Richard Jordan as Dr.
  Jeffrey Pelt and an impressive Peter Firth as Political Officer
  Ivan Putin bring a needed sense of pragmatism to their collective
  roles to bolster the dramatics and emotion of the story. This was
  probably one of Alec Baldwin's best performances and he truly
  conducts himself in the manner that the character of Jack Ryan
  should have been portrayed. Baldwin perfectly conveyed the
  analytical mind that the character of Jack Ryan embodied. Sam
  Neill is also brilliant as the dedicated officer who also
  possesses a very human side that perhaps puts him in conflict
  with carrying out his duties to the full extent of his country's
  political dictates and ambitions. Sam Neill has a wonderful role
  in this regard and he plays it flawlessly. I liked Scott Glenn's
  character immensely as the US Commander who truly has to rely on
  his instincts and his logical interpretation of facts and events
  to face what is put before him. The list of performances goes on
  but the point is that portrayal of these characters and how they
  think and conduct themselves is at the heart of this film. Their
  efforts make this film a great political, action-adventure and
  emotional drama.</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">This was a subject of much conversation when

  same...until finally,the day comes when the alarm goes off and
  you wake up realizing it's the day you leave. The movie is high
  in entertainment value and the story is unusual and unique; Bill
  Murray was the perfect choice to cast in the lead roll and the
  supporting cast all played their parts just as well. It's fun
  watching the lead character develop and become a new man, and it

  some, but god, hasn't anyone ever considered watching everything
  with a speculative eye? It's less biased than the news is - he
  reports, you decide, and most of it is things that should have

  <Text category="dvd">If you follow my reviews, you know that I
  felt the version of "Jack the Ripper" with Michael Caine as
  Inspector Fred Abberline was a phenomenal masterpiece. Not only
  was Michael Caine phenomenal in the role, but that version
  offered convincing speculation to a mystery we don't know and
  never will. While I respect this version with Johnny Depp, it is
  more horror oriented. (Michael Caine's version was more
  historical.) Onto the subject at hand. Some of you may know
  Jack's 5 victims. (Mary Anne Nichols, Annie Chapman, Elizabeth
  Stride, Kathy Eadows, and Mary Jane Kelly.) Well, they seem to
  have a close friendship, and we also get the impression that they
  share some dangerous secret. (In the Michael Caine version, the 5
  victims knew each other, but they were just associates.) Well, of
  course Jack the Ripper comes into play. One scene is very well
  done in that while we don't see his face, we do see some
  disturbing pictures, and we do see him cutting his steak and
  pouring blood red wine. In comes Depp (Inspector Fred Abberline).
  It is interesting that while the older Michael Caine brought
  frustration and tremendous energy to the role, Johnny Depp looks
  like his character is living on borrowed time and going to die
  anyday. But maybe Depp didn't want to just imitate Caine. One
  thing I had a problem with was that while Caine had some trouble
  with his superiors, Depp's trouble with his superiors is blown
  out of proportion. (Without giving the story away, his superiors
  must have known things that they didn't tell Depp! At least
  Caine's superiors carried some reason on their side!) You'll
  probably notice that Depp finds things out much quicker than
  Caine did. (Probably because Caine's version was 4 hours, while
  Depp's is only 2.) While Caine was involved with an artist, Depp
  becomes involved with Mary Jane Kelly. Gradually, Depp discovers
  things that put together an interesting puzzle. Like Caine did in
  his version, Depp ironically gets close and almost friendly with
  the killer. (OF COURSE, DEPP DOES NOT KNOW HE IS TALKING TO THE
  KILLER.) Well, another problem here is that in the Caine version,
  we can understand more why the killer appeared normal and was
  even friendly with Caine. We never really understand here why the
  killer is friendly and even helpful to Depp. (Jack the Ripper
  does not have the same mental illness he did in the Caine
  version.) I will admit that the scenery is well done, the
  elements of horror are there, and Depp did a good job of not just
  imitating Michael Caine. And Depp's sergeant Godley does offer
  some entertainment. But if you saw the Michael Caine version, you
  will undoubtedly miss the quite probable historical accuracy. If
  on the other hand, you don't mind the fact that this version is
  more geared towards horror than history, you'll probably find it
  a respectable horror movie. SIDE NOTE: Johnny Depp makes
  Inspector Fred Abberline look like he's going to die anyday.
  Well, in reality, Fred Abberline lived on for 40 more years after
  he stopped Jack the Ripper.</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">There are plenty of anti-Bush films and
  books around. If you only shall see or read one, this must be the
  best pick. I like Michael Moore very much, but he is not really a
  political heavyweighter. And i don't think Fahrenheit 9/11 is his
  best work, it does not mix humour and political insight as well
  as the book "stupid white men" for instance. It is more like two
  or three movies in one. William Karel IS a political
  heavyweighter and he does not try to make anything more than a
  documentary. But what a documentary it has turned out to be. Very
  disturbing insights from informed sources, among them former
  CIA-agents. It is not usual to hear such plain speaking from
  "people in high places" just a few years after the events. This
  film is perhaps not as entertaining as Fahrenheit 9/11, but far
  more informative.</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">From a serious U2 fan's perspective, the
  best thing about this dvd is simply the selection of songs. The
  bonus material is cool, the sound quality's great, the visuals
  are always impressive, but it's the SONGS that are the real
  attraction. As it should be. Two scorching rockers from their
  criminally ignored debut album BOY, four in a row from the
  all-time masterpiece ACHTUNG BABY, and nearly everything from
  their Grammy-sweeping triumph HOW TO DISMANTLE AN ATOMIC BOMB. I
  also love that they chose to not play anything from their string
  of disappointing nineties albums. Good call! Also, Many familiar
  songs are given exciting new treatments, such as Running To Stand
  Still (a perfect hybrid of the Joshua Tree and Zoo TV versions),
  Elevation (longer, better build-up), Bullet The Blue Sky (check
  out Edge's extended blues jam in the final minutes), and Original
  of the Species (acoustic piano ballad). This was the first major
  U2 tour in which they routinely and substantially altered the set
  list. For instance, when I saw them they played Miss Sarajevo,
  Stuck In A Moment, Gloria, I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking
  For, Instant Karma, Until The End Of The World, and others not
  represented here. Here's hoping they release at least one more
  Vertigo Tour DVD...</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">I had never watched this film before
  ordering it, so I took the chance. It turned out to be a smart
  buy! As usual, Peck is just awesome. He seems to fit this role
  well, as if it captures a true part of his persona as a family
  man. As the movie continues you realize that you can relate to
  the character on a personal level. I enojoyed the flashback
  sequences and thought they were placed well throughout the film.
  Overall, this movie supplies drama and action for the viewer. So,
  if you are considering purchasing this dvd, I'd suggest you buy
  it. You'll enjoy it</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">China: The Panda Adventure is an IMAX film
  that tells a story.. So..in a sense the Pandas are a part of this
  story but not in the sense of a documentary. The story is set in
  1936 and is based on a true story involving Ruth Harkness who has
  arrived in China to take care of the business affairs of her late
  husband. Her husband, it seems was a great admirer of the Giant
  Panda and in his journal he writes a beautiful story about his
  experiences with them..This leads Ruth to seek these Pandas out
  to see for herself..As the story unfolds we see the beauty and
  majesty of China..The cinematography is outstanding and the music
  fits the film quite well.. Ruth is played by the lovely Maria
  Bello and there is an additional documentary about the making of
  this film is which she talks about her reasons for wanting to do
  this film and her fascination with the Panda.. All in all..this
  film is a nice way to spend the evening with your family..but be

  <Text category="dvd">I was stunned by this movie. I learned of it
  and purchased it in 2003. For various reasons it remains for me
  the best, most emotional movie I have seen about musicians and
  their music. The producer chose well: He found the songwriters
  that shaped country and rock for the next 30 years: Townes Van
  Zandt, Rodney Crowell, Steve Earle, Guy Clark, Steve Young, John
  Hiatt, Charlie Daniels and a tribute to the late Skinny Dennis,
  immortalized in Guy Clark's "LA Freeway." I wish David Allen Coe
  had been left out, but no film is perfect. The songwriters are
  shown at their best and worst: a drunken, funny TVZ falls into a
  rabbit hole and Silent Night is rendered by fine musicians too
  drunk to remember the lyrics. This movie was made when I was a
  poor student and musician with a small circle of talented friends
  in Tampa at the University of South Florida. The difference is
  that most of my friends and I got straight jobs [we still tried
  to make a difference] but these musicians changed the world, just
  a little. I married the singer/Business major I met at USF and
  divorced 30 years later. I still play guitar, write and record at
  home and dream of making it in music - but mostly I learn songs
  written by artists like those in this movie and try to understand
  the magic they have that still captures me. When TVZ sang
  'Waiting around to die' he brought tears to the eyes of his 70+
  blacksmith neighbor, while Cindy comforts him. It was magical.
  TVZ does a "medley of my hit" and sings "Pancho and Lefty," and
  Rodney Crowell sang "Bluebird Wine," both covered by Emmylou.
  Steve Young's "Alabama Highways" was wonderful too. It was a look
  into my past - and the past and future of the intelligent,
  emotional music I love best.</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">I guess I understand why this movie was so
  savagely criticized during it's year of release, 1986. Prince was
  still enjoying huge popularity based largely on the success of
  "Purple Rain," both the film and the soundtrack. And critics love
  to knock someone off a pedestal, which is what they did to Prince
  in those days. Many claimed that the movie was nothing more than
  an ego trip. They couldn't believe Prince had the nerve to fire
  the director and then assume that role himself. It was all way
  too harsh criticism for a movie that isn't trying to be anything
  more than a fun romantic comedy. Of course, poor critical
  response alone doesn't usually keep the public from making a
  movie popular. Yet "Under the Cherry Moon" was a bomb at he box
  office. Probably the main reason for this is that the movie,
  although shot in color, was released in black-and-white. For some
  unfathomable reason, the general movie-going public is more often
  than not horrified at the prospect of seeing a black-and-white
  movie. Now don't get me wrong, I'm not claiming that had the
  movie been released in color that people would have flocked to it
  in droves. I'm only saying that it would have attracted more of
  an audience if it had been in color. I will acknowledge that this
  movie's target audience is Prince fans. Since I am one myself,
  and have been most of my life, I'm not the most entirely
  objective viewer. But I make no apologies for my love of this
  movie. It's not a "guilty pleasure" for me, because I proudly
  hold this as one of my favorites. I had only seen it a couple
  times before the DVD release - and unfotunately I missed it in
  theaters (I couldn't get anyone to take me, I was only 12 and
  none of my friends were into P and certainly not my parents -
  though my dad went with me a few years later to see "Grafitti
  Bridge" on opening night, but that's for another review). But
  since it's DVD release in 2004, this has become one of my
  most-watched discs in my collection. The soundtrack is KILLER,
  the tunes make up one of the best Prince albums ever. There's
  even some great stuff heard in the movie that didn't make the
  album (some of which was issued on 12" vinyl). Plus, I think the
  movie looks great - the cinematographer was Michael Ballhaus, who
  has multiple Academy Award nominations to his credit (and was the
  DP on numerous Martin Scorsese classics). I wonder how the movie
  would feel in color, but I do think black-and-white was the right
  way to go. Even though the movie is set in then-contemporary
  times, it has the feel of something from the '30s. There are so
  many classic moments in this movie, I won't try to list them all.
  But here are a few... Christopher Tracy (Prince) giving his "Bela
  Lugosi eyes"...Tricky (Jerome Benton) tossing rose petals into
  the tub while Christopher takes a bath...Christopher freaking out
  when he sees bats at the eatery...the "Wreka Stow" scene...the
  car race between Christopher and Mary Sharon (Kristen Scott
  Thomas). As for the acting, I've heard a lot of people saying
  that Prince's performance was no good. I don't see much truth in
  that claim. After being so serious in "Purple Rain," it was a
  nice contrast to see him so loose and funny in this. Jerome
  Benton proved he could do just fine even without Morris Day at
  his side (as in "Purple Rain") - I'm surprised Jerome hasn't done
  much additional acting outside of Prince movies. And obviously
  Kristen Scott Thomas moved on from this, her first major role, to
  become an Oscar-nominated, highly repected leading lady. How is
  the DVD presentation? Pretty good, for such a largely overlooked
  movie. The widescreen transfer and 2.0 stereo mix aren't anything
  phenomenal, but get the job done nonetheless; the movie looks and
  sounds fine. As for features, anyone expecting a full-blown
  Special Edition like the 2-disc "Purple Rain" will be
  disappointed. But at least it's not a completely bare-bones
  release - four music videos are included, though unfortunately
  not presented in optimal audio/visual quality (though they are
  passable, I would've preferred 5.1 mixes). The highlight is the
  live performance of "anotherlover" which was taken from a
  never-released (at least not domestically, not sure if it saw the
  light of day anywhere outside the U.S.) concert video documenting
  the Parade tour. MTV held an interesting (i.e.- very weird)
  contest to determine where "Under the Cherry Moon" would have
  it's world premiere. The ten-thousandth caller to an MTV hotline
  would accompany Prince to the premiere, which would be held in
  their hometown. MTV ran a special that covered the premiere party
  - and unlike the premiere of "Purple Rain" unfortunately this
  program is not to be found on "Under the Cherry Moon"'s DVD
  release. Lisa Barber was the contest winner, and the movie did
  indeed premiere in her hometown of Sheridan, Wyoming - a very
  unusual place for a big movie to premiere. When asked what he
  thought of the town of Sheridan, Prince summed it up with a
  single word: "Purple."</Text>

  <Text category="dvd">This DVD is amazing! Perfectly puts the
  Blues on display through the high-points and the low points of
  the season. The best thing about this dvd, besides the flying, is
  the respect they show the crew. Yeah, the pilots get the glory
  and do the high flying cool stuff, but, they are FAAAAR from the
  stars of the show! The maintainers and support people behind the
  flying is where the stars hide. This dvd also shines the light on
  the pilots and what they do. They truly go through the mill, but,
  they don't do a single thing with those Blue jets if the crew
  does not do their job perfectly. This is FINALLY a dvd that
  shines the light on the pilots, BUT, makes it clear that nothing
  happens without the crew in support of the pilots. Great Job!!!
  Unlike the retired one who reviewed also (great review by the
  way!!!!), I would not like to be a pilot after seeing this! I
  would rather get FAAAR more reward working in my support role and
  knowing that the pilot gets his glory only because my ability to
  do the work allows it</Text>

  <Text category="dvd">Joe Versus The Volcano is a rare blend of
  comedy and insight that's romantic enough for girls, funny enough
  for guys, with effective visual symbolism, and appropriate for
  the whole family. Maybe it could be described as an allegory for
  escaping the drudgery of life, or something like that, but at any
  rate it's pleasant to watch, at times profound, at other times
  funny. The beginning 3rd is about Joe (Tom Hanks) struggling with
  hypochondria and a lousy, really crummy job, primarily because of
  the dreary work environment and the typical (oppressive)
  supervisor (Dan Hedaya). (I've been there myself, when I worked
  at Pines Mfg H&amp;amp;H Tooling and again at Toro, where
  everyone was on dope.) Joe learns from his doctor (Robert Stack,
  of The Untouchables) that he has a "brain cloud" and only a few
  months to live. The tone of the movie rises as Joe quits his job
  and we feel like impending death is the best thing that's ever
  happened to him. He takes a former co-worker (Meg Ryan) to dinner
  and seems to wake up to life for the first time. The next day
  billionaire Lloyd Bridges (Airplane) enters Joe's life with a
  bizarre proposition: Since he's dying anyway, why not literally
  jump into a volcano - for the billionaire's own financial motive
  - and live it up with unlimited credit at the his expense in the
  meantime. Joe accepts and in his journey to the volcanic island
  learns about how to live life from helpful chauffeur Ossie Davis
  (The Client) and the billionaire's two daughters - both played by
  Meg Ryan (Sleepless in Seattle), which makes a total of 3 roles
  for her in this great movie, making it even more pleasant to
  watch</Text>

  <Text category="dvd">This movie is 24 hours of kids being amoral
  creatures doing whatever strikes their fancy at the moment. Sex,
  drugs, beating on people, stealing, whatever keeps boredom at
  bay. There is no script to speak of, just watching them being
  themselves. One kid called Telly (about 15 or 16) who has AIDS
  (and may not know it) likes young virgins (12 to 14 year old
  girls). He's a predator with no conscience at all. Probably a
  sociopath. And his buddy Casper is a dumb punk who swills beer.
  He's just as bad as Telly. I have no doubt that teens like this
  exist. They existed back in the '70s when I was a teen. I'm sure
  most of the viewers of this disturbing movie don't have children.
  Perhaps parents need to view this to see what unsupervised teens
  are doing. I'm sure kids like this are not just only in the slums
  but in suburbia too. And small towns. And even rural areas. This
  movie isn't for the squeamish but if one parent watches and
  starts giving their child more attention it might be worth a
  sleepless night or a feeling of revulsion for them.</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">This film is a landmark in blending science
  and advocacy. It seeks to assert that animals lead complex and
  sophisticated emotional lives, not unlike our own. But it manages
  to walk the fine line between subjectivity and objectivity. It
  avoids going too far into the subjective. It doesn't try to
  emotionally blackmail the viewer with mere cute/stagey displays
  of animal interaction. Instead it relies heavily on scientific
  observation in both natural and controlled environments. But by
  the sheer genious of editing and writing, one cannot help but be
  drawn into the lives of these noble creatures just as one would a
  good drama. The movie wisely lets the animals' behavior "do the
  talking", and doesn't try to push the viewers' judgement one way
  or the other. It left me rethinking everything I had assumed
  about animals, emotions, and the nature of our (and by 'our' I
  mean all of God's creatures) existence</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">Bob Crane shot to television stardom in the
  1960s as the star of the television series Hogan's Heroes.
  However, while he was enjoying the life of a TV star, he was
  simultaneously delving into dark territory in his personal life -
  sexual promiscuity and deviance. Auto Focus tells the story of
  Bob Crane as a tragic cautionary tale of the dangers of excess.
  When the film opens, Bob (Greg Kinnear, in a fantastic
  performance) is about to hit the big time, and is a loving family
  man who doesn't drink or smoke. He attends mass on Sundays. One
  day on the set of Hogan's Heroes, though, his life begins to take
  a bit of a turn when he meets John Carpenter (Willem Dafoe), a
  techno-guy with all the latest gadgets, including video
  equipment, which fascinates Crane. "Carp" opens the door for Bob
  to unleash his inner desires, which both excite and frighten him.
  It begins innocently enough, sitting in on the drums at a strip
  club, but eventually Bob loses all self-control and ends up
  making pornographic videos of his exploits and frequently
  "swinging." All the while Bob refuses to admit that there's
  anything wrong with him; if you ask him, he'll tell you he's just
  a normal guy. After Hogan's Heroes came to an end, Crane took a
  job with a dinner theatre show, which allowed Crane and Carp to
  take their liaisons on a traveling show. As Crane's indiscretions
  get worse, his personal life deteriorates, as he divorces two
  wives (played by Rita Wilson and Mario Bello). Auto Focus has
  been expertly directed by Paul Schrader, who begins the film with
  bright, glossy colors, then as Crane goes deeper and deeper into
  his obsessions, the colors fade and the camera becomes unstable,
  just as Crane does. Kinnear gives the performance of his life,
  showing us an uptight man who is afraid of his sexual demons
  turning into an uptight man who lets them take over his
  life.</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">The French title of this film is IN EXTREMIS
  (though translated as TO THE EXTREME) and means 'in desperate
  circumstances, especially at the point of death'. Rethinking the
  story of this interesting but problematic movie in those terms
  after viewing gives the cinematic effort more poignancy. This is
  a tale of the impact of family, loss of parents, dissolution of
  the core unit has on us all: in this story we are asked to exam
  the 'in extremis' state of such trauma. Thomas
  (S&amp;#x1A;bastien Roch) is a hedonist, a handsome young man
  whose parents died in an Alpine accident, and a man who sleeps
  with both sexes in a confused state of true identity. He lives
  with one of his female lovers who has a young teenage son
  Gr&amp;#x1A;goire (J&amp;#x1A;r&amp;#x1A;my Sanguinetti) whom he
  loves as a son. When the mother accidentally dies,
  Gr&amp;#x1A;goire wants Thomas to be his guardian. Thomas'
  lifestyle does not lend itself to fatherhood and though he deeply
  loves Gr&amp;#x1A;goire, by law and by proclivity he cannot
  assume the role of foster parent. Even with the aid of his
  prostitute sister Anne (Julie Depardieu) he is unable to keep the
  disappointed Gr&amp;#x1A;goire from being sent to a prison-like
  orphanage. Thomas finds solace from his lover Vincent
  (Aur&amp;#x1A;lien Wiik) and from his excursions into the
  bohemian all night orgies where he attempts to forget his promise
  to be available at all times for Gr&amp;#x1A;goire. Eventually
  Thomas' devotion to Gr&amp;#x1A;goire overcomes his hedonistic
  addiction and results in his aiding the boy's escape from the
  orphanage to move with him to the home in Ibiza his deceased
  parents owned. The story has a bizarre but touching ending, which
  comes totally unexpectedly, and revealing it would ruin the
  impact and message of the film. Director/writer Etienne Faure
  ('Prisonnier', and '&amp;#x1A; la recherche de Tadzio' which is
  included on this CD and traces the life of the actor
  Bj&amp;#x1A;rn Andresen who played Tadzio in the film 'Death in
  Venice') directs his actors well but is less successful in
  finding the interaction of flashbacks, fantasies, graphic
  indulgences and superimposed poetry inundated with noisy music.
  But given these distractions the film still makes a simple case
  for the significance of family - genetic and extended - and
  therein is the power of the story. This is obviously the work of
  a young director with copious ideas about film and as such one
  can forgive many of the early experimental indulgences because
  the heart is in the right place. In French with English
  subtitles. Grady Harp, May 05</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">I always love it when Prevention release
  another workout because I get bored easy and I like to mix
  workouts up. I've loved all of the other Prevention workouts and
  knew I'd love this too. Chris Freytag leads again and does
  another superb job. There are two aerobic routines and five
  targeted toning workouts. The dvd is programmable so you can do
  them in any order and do as many or as little as you want. That's
  a big plus so you don't get bored or pushed for time. You can
  choose whether you need to lose weight or just firm up etc. If,
  for example, you pick that you need to lose weight, there is a
  six day week with the routines mapped out for you already. That
  is so helpful. The moves are all basic no frills moves, but they
  are effective. The first cardio section is low impact and the
  second is a variety of low and higher impact moves making it just
  that little bit harder. The body parts are all the ones you want
  to workout; arms, butt, abs and thighs. All you really need for
  this dvd is dumbells and a lot of energy. This is so easy to do
  due to the programming, so there really is no excuse for not
  working out. This can be done by practically anyone. I also love
  how the other two girls exercising as well, aren't the kinds that
  yell and shout etc. They are as professional as Chris</Text>

  <Text category="dvd">There aren't many films from any era that
  come close to being "perfect" (though that's not really the right
  word) in just about every way--probably you could count them on
  your fingers and have some left over. "Friendly Persuasion" is
  one of those films--in spades. Directed by William Wyler and
  starring Gary Cooper, Dorothy McGuire, and Tony Perkins, it is a
  wonderful, human story about a loving family of Quakers (also
  known as Friends) living in one of the Union-Confederate "border"
  states at the time of the Civil War in the 1860s. The cast, in
  small roles and large, is uniformly excellent, none calling
  attention to themselves but rather becoming their characters and
  making us understand them. Led by beloved, legendary star Gary
  Cooper in a great performance as the head of the Quaker family
  Jess Birdwell, they are marvelous, including child actor Richard
  Eyer as feisty "Little Jess", scrapping with his big sister or
  partaking in a running feud with "Samantha", his mother Eliza
  Birdwell's pet goose, who more than carries her end of the feud
  with scene-stealing craftiness. There are incidents of family
  humor and love and occasional disagreements, and a hilarious
  episode in which eldest son Josh (Perkins) accompanies father
  Jess on a sales trip and is set upon by the scrappy, amorous
  daughters of one of Jess's customers (Marjorie Main). We are
  settled into a lovely, lively exploration of the Birdwell
  family's idyllic existence. Then the war intrudes. Josh feels he
  must volunteer to fight as long as others have to, even though it
  is against the teachings of his faith. His younger sister loves a
  young Union officer who is soon to go into battle. Rebel troops
  are nearing the region where they live, and no one, including the
  audience, quite knows what will happen. There is a beautifully
  honest and dramatic sequence in which young Josh gets his first
  taste of battle, which Perkins performs with heartbreaking
  realism. I recall my father, a World War II veteran, saying that
  this scene was the most realistic depiction of a young man's
  first time in battle that he had ever seen in the movies. When it
  is all over and the Birdwells return to their quiet,
  hard-working, loving life as a family, the music (Dimitri
  Tiomkin's marvelous score) swells, the wonderful lyrics to the
  song "Friendly Persuasion" are sung sweetly by the young Pat
  Boone, and you realize you have spent two wonderful hours with
  these genuinely fine, completely human characters in ordinary
  life and in challenging times. The story has been told with
  integrity, honesty, humanity, gentle humor, kind restraint and,
  yes, love--all of these also attributes of the Birdwell family
  that we have come to know. That is the "genius" of this film.
  Along with a very few others, it shows us who we are, who we can
  be, and how we can live, all with a grace and humility that is
  almost poetic. And the film never, ever loses its balance. It's
  just a great and good movie. I've seen it almost a dozen times,
  and it can still move me to tears. I'm betting it could be
  released today, amid the ridiculously over-budgeted, badly
  executed films that rely too much on computer effects and star
  charisma, and that it would clean up at the box office. The term
  "family values" has been kicked around a lot lately, and nobody
  quite seems to know what is really meant by it. Watch this truly
  beautiful film and you'll get a pretty good idea of the genuine
  meaning of those words.</Text>

  Dead has that 79 feel, with wide camera shots that allow the
  characters to breathe, unlike so many modern horror flicks that
  smother the stars with endless closeups. The zombie gore is to be
  noted, as its quite gory near the end of the film and at some
  parts throughout, but no real feasting occurs till the end, for
  the ultimate payoff. Yes, the zombies are pasty and fresh, since
  the outbreak has just began, which joins a team of four who

  <Text category="dvd">It embarrases me that I, a music man, have
  let this many years go by without reviewing this splendid movie.
  My wife rented it from a Hasting's video store back when DVDs
  were not widely distributed. I was in awe of the movie as it
  ended because I had no clue what to expect, and I wasn't
  expecting much anyway. Richard Dreyfuss plays the role of Glenn
  Holland, a recent college graduate who takes the job of a music
  teacher to provide an income (he calls it a 'fall back position')
  while he writes what he hopes will be a musical masterpiece that
  will make him rich and famous. His first semester is a trying and
  learning experience as students see him as that school teacher
  everybody hated and whose class everyone dreaded. But he finds
  his way into the students' hearts. The movie begins in the early
  1960s, and rock 'n' roll has etched a permanent mark on the music
  landscape. Most of the students, of course, love the new music.
  Realizing he has an 'in' with the students, he makes an accurate
  comparison by playing Bach's "Minuet in G" (for Anna Magdalena)
  and asking the students what song it is. They reply it is the
  "Lovers Concerto" by the Toys ("What color is the rain that falls
  softly on my window.."). He notes they are wrong and that it is
  actually the SAME song (although he doesn't note that Bach's is
  in 3/4 and the Toys in 4/4) and is an example of an ancient music
  scale called the Dorian scale. He now has them right where he
  wants them. Along the way, he continues to work on his
  masterpiece. But life, a new baby who turns out to be deaf, and
  the need for new things put his life on hold. As he notes by
  quoting John Lennon, "Life is what happens while you're making
  other plans" (or some facsimile thereof). Years continue to go by
  and events occur that happen in the life of virtually ever music
  teacher. He has that one student who has a lot of heart but not a
  lot of ability - yet needs to get an hour of credit so he can
  remain eligible to play football. He has another student who
  wants to play the clarinet but is nervous. Yet he always comes
  back to the simple rock 'n' roll to make his point about 'real'
  music. But reality plays hide and seek sometimes. He has it out
  with his wife about their deaf son - and his frustrations come to
  a boiling point on the night John Lennon is killed. Over time,
  they become friends - and one of the sweet sights of the movie is
  the son feeling the vibrations from the speaker as he 'hears' the
  music. But another reality awaits - education budget cuts, and
  here Dreyfuss delivers the line with outstanding effect: "The day
  they cut the football budget in this state...well, that will
  certainly be the end of western civilization as we know it." It
  is in the presence of his now good friend, Jay Thomas (the
  football coach), that he talks about how he never wanted to teach
  but now that is all he wants to do. The music track in this movie
  is awesome. There's just one thing I'm still trying to figure
  out: how did the students manage to mass distribute his music and
  practice it without him knowing it?</Text>

  <Text category="dvd">SOUND OF MUSIC 40th ANNIVERSARY EDITION
  (Fox) is the latest digital version of this beloved, timeless,
  film. The two-disc set features an exceptionally sharp transfer
  and a rich audio mix but the real treat is the new commentary
  with Julie Andrews and Christopher Plummer (this in addition to
  the late Robert Wise's commentary). Among the wealth of new
  treasures in the six hours of extras is on location footage,
  screen tests (Mia Farrow sings) and a wonderful retrospective
  documentary "My Favorite Things: Julie Andrews Remembers." Sound
  of Music is perfect in all departments. It's also that rare
  musical in which the music itself is naturally integral to the
  story and a counterpoint to the Nazi threat of the true-life
  plot. Until hi-def DVDs arrive, this is the definitive edition
  for the library. Rated: G. Genre: Musical. 2 Hours, 56 Minutes.
  Starring: Julie Andrews, Christopher Plummer. Director: Robert

  <Text category="dvd">This is my first review for Amazon. I've
  always felt that the reviews that I read were adequate to
  represent the movies and anime that I liked. Not this time. I
  have an extensive collection of anime. Everything from the really
  silly stuff, filled with fan service, to the very serious
  classics that so many fans rave about. I'm not really into the
  mecha thing, though I do have a lot of it. It's the animation
  first that drives my interest, then its the story and the
  character development are close seconds. Appleseed has all that
  I'm looking for in an anime, and in Spades. Great characters, a
  well crafted plot, and some of the best animation I have ever
  see. To say, as some reviewers have, that the movement in this
  version are unnatural,is more than unfair, it's just not true.
  All action is extremely lifelike, and the action scenes are the
  best I've ever seen. I actually found myself reversing the disc
  to rewatch some action repeatedly, something I never do. I've
  owned this version of Appleseed a few weeks now, and I have
  watched it at least five times, and am looking forward to another
  veiwing soon. I have relied on Amazon reveiws to decide whether
  or not to buy anime in the past, so I hope that this reveiw is
  helpful. There is a lot of good anime worth investing in, and
  this one is near the top of my list</Text>

  <Text category="dvd">This is a typical (semi slapstick) Gaiday
  film. It is corny, well produced, and will please anyone who
  enjoys the upper crust of silly comedy. The subtitles are just
  fine. You do not have to understand any Russian to laugh at this
  movie. Buy it, and enjoy</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">Sandra Bullock gives an outstanding and
  believable performance in the role of Angela Bennett. In this
  film she plays the part of a solitary and lonely computer expert.
  An online hacker friend calls to tell her he's found an amazing
  disk and is sending it to her to check out. Unfortunately, he's
  killed in a plane crash before he can visit her. The disk turns
  out to have secret government information and is wanted by a
  terrorist group who plan the downfall of the U.S. government.
  Angela Bennett recognizes that the disk is something special and
  before she really realizes what she has, she finds that she's
  being stalked. What happens next is everyone's worst nightmare.
  Through the miracle of computers, the evil group steal Angela's
  identify and there are few people to vouch for her. The story
  quickly turns into a cyber thriller. She tries to get help, but
  she appears to have no friends and doesn't even know her own
  neighbors. Her mother (Diane Baker) is in an institution and is
  apparently suffering from Alzheimer's. Her former boyfriend,
  played by Dennis Miller does try to help her, but the forces of
  evil are difficult to hide from. Jeremy Northam delivers a spine
  tingling performance as the charming and mysterious Jack Devlin.

  <Text category="dvd">Actually I felt I was in love with this film
  as soon as I saw the very beginning - the opening credits against
  the background of Chicago seen from high above and provided with
  beautiful music. "Candyman" could have become another teenage
  urban legend flick with not much of a sense, but Bernard Rose
  managed to squeeze everything possible from the story making a
  brilliant, enchanting and spellbinding film out of it. If you're
  interested mostly in gore and some physical manifestations of
  horror you won't find it here (you will, but not in quantities
  you used to). "Candyman" is more of a psychological horror where
  atmosphere is what's important, where mood is what matters, where
  you are given some food for thought. I don't have enough words to
  describe the whole perfection of this gorgeous film, I can only
  say it's a great achievement of Bernard Rose as a director
  besides I guess Tony Todd, Virginia Madsen and Xander Berkeley
  had their best roles played in this feature. I don't personally
  think that 90s were fertile regarding the horror genre, but
  "Candyman" is a true gem which wouldn't be lost among the
  greatest horror titles of all times. By the way if you don't want
  to spoil your impression of the film, better don't watch
  "Candyman" parts 2 and 3. They ARE the average tenage urban
  legend flicks.</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">This exercise video was very easy to get
  started on and you could do all the exercises in very limited
  space. This is great for people who do not have alot of room.
  After exercising to the video, I felt really good, energized. I
  would definitely recommend it to someone who is just starting out
  exercising. It is low impact and easy to follow</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">WOW. That's the only thing I can say after
  reading all sorts of negative reviews. I admit, the very first
  time I watched the Grudge with my father NEITHER of us thought
  the movie was scary at all and couldn't understand its success,
  but after watching the movie a second time two months later by
  myself late at night I REALLY began to see how frightening the
  movie is. Probably contains the same amount of fear as the
  original Exorcist, another movie that's really effectively well
  done. You HAVE to watch the Exorcist and the Grudge at night to
  get the proper effect. The Grudge benefits greatly when it comes
  to maintaining a moody atmosphere and a pretty interesting story.
  I say "pretty interesting" because the storyline isn't the best,
  or the easiest to understand. Just interesting enough to get the
  job done. The Grudge also benefits when it comes to not giving
  away too much or too little. In fact, this is probably its
  strongest point. Every time something scary happens, you see just
  a "little bit" of that scary monster boy or some kind of strange
  shadow effect, which is *very* important if you want to
  effectively scare someone. If the scary boy had appeared on
  screen for longer than a few seconds it wouldn't have scared me
  nearly as much because I would have gotten used to seeing it. The
  boy appears, and then he's gone. Not giving away too much REALLY
  works with this movie. You see, to really scare me you simply
  CAN'T put a scary monster on screen for long periods of time and
  you HAVE to create a moody atmosphere to make the film
  believable. The Grudge works *extremely* well it this area. The
  fact that something scary happens almost always unexpectedly in
  the Grudge allows me to give the film another compliment. I'm
  telling you, the scene with the woman inside that building by
  herself (well, except for a security guard) and having to travel
  home to an apartment building all by herself is about 10 minutes
  of total bone-chilling excitement. I *loved* this scene. I was
  totally on the edge of my seat wondering when the woman was
  finally going to have something bad happen to her. The scene
  where the woman saw darkness coming before walking down the
  stairs and having to hurry up to get out of there was *awesome*,
  and the scene a few moments after this happened where she DID see
  something in the shadow was ANOTHER awesome display of
  bone-chilling brilliance. There's a bunch of scenes like this
  throughout the movie. Freakin' AWESOME! Excellent pacing and
  suspense makes the Grudge a true horror classic, in my opinion.
  I've seen a thousand horror movies in my time and I'd easily put
  the Grudge right up there as one of the best. People today have
  drastically different opinions when it comes to what makes a
  movie scary. Remember the good old days when everyone could agree
  that the Exorcist was the scariest movie of all-time? I wish
  everyone agreed that the Grudge is a total classic, and that the
  Ring is another excellent one.</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">This is a fine, leveled workout, including
  stretching, aerobics, abdominal exercises and strength training
  moves (without weights). Gilad takes you through it with plenty
  of advance cues and tips to help you change moves smoothly, and
  position yourself properly for optimum muscle and cardiac work.
  The 30 minute workout is just right for an early-morning, before
  work routine. The 60 minute version is an extended workout good
  for weekends. Much better than most of these videos, this is
  particularly well suited to middle aged fitness buffs.</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">So, why give Justice League the full 5
  stars? Because it appeals to every generation in my family. I
  bought this for my 4 year old son who is enamored with
  superheros. As we hung out together watching the shows, I was as
  engrossed in the story as my son. Then I noticed that my wife was
  intrigued; and so were the grandparents! The characters and plots
  are very well developed for a "cartoon", so it is more like
  watching a dramatic series. Watching the series allows you to
  pick up on sub-plots too; like the attraction between Batman and
  WonderWoman - Jean Jone's struggle to find a place as the last of
  his people - and the entire groups struggle to work together as a
  cohesive team. Another excellent buy to consider would be the
  Spiderman the New Animated Series</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">I started watching it and couldn't stop. I
  read the book a long time ago and I still think that's better but
  the movie is really good too. Highly recommended</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">"Dave" is a lot of fun, as a look-alike gets
  to pretend to be president, gradually gets a big head and tries
  to use the power, and makes high-stakes enemies. I am a big fan
  of Sigourney Weaver, and she is very good here. Kevin Kline does
  well, as well. The forces of good beat back the dark side of
  politics for awhile, and an ordinary guy finds extraordinary
  adventure and true love. Definitely worth a rental, if romantic
  and comic politics with a bit of danger is your bag</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">I first saw this movie on TV as a college
  student. I loved it so much that an old boyfriend went out and
  bought it for me on VHS tape. I have watched this movie so many
  times I'm surprised the VHS tape is still working! The actors are
  perfectly cast in the leads. They are so believeable in their
  portrayals that I could have gone to high school with them. The
  kissing scene is HOT. Clothes don't need to come off for you to
  feel the hot wind of chemistry and passion that blows off that
  first kiss scene. The characters are not glossy, and that is what
  I love about John Hughes. He portrays coming-of-age in all its
  naked and truest glory, not the perfect airbrushed schlock that
  has come out in later years. If you're looking to see character
  development and great plot set to a great soundtrack, this is
  your type of movie</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">This is a most beautiful movie. I can`t
  imagine anyone not enjoying it. The two disc package is brilliant
  and I will be heirlooming mine to stay in the family long after I
  have gone</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">This movie was both entertaining and at
  times, hilarious. Charlie Sheen is great as the fallen
  stockbroker turned advice columnist, Denise Richards is funny as
  his ditzy, shallow girlfriend and Angie Harmon is appealing as
  the editor of the newspaper. Also, Jon Lovitz is hysterical as
  Sheen's plastic surgeon best friend. This movie is a must for
  those who want some lighthearted humor. I highly recommend
  it.</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">"Panic Room" is a great thriller- Jodie
  Foster's return to the big screen. I'd assume most people would
  enjoy the film itself. However, the real treat in the 3-Disc
  Special Edition is the behind-the-scenes footage explaining the
  wondeful camera work and production in the film. Any movie lover
  will be blown away by the creativity and the vision the director
  brings to this picture</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">Season one of Nelwlyweds is hilarious....you
  will enjoy watching Nick &amp;amp; Jessica and all the funny
  moments that took place the first year of their marriage! The
  extra footage on the dvd's gives you even more insight from the
  "lovebirds" themselves! I recommond "Newlyweds" to all the Nick
  &amp;amp; Jessica fans out there</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">I've never been quite a fan of music DVDs.
  By that I mean the live stuff. I much rather be there to
  experience it then sit at home pretending I'm there. That's one
  side of it. I'm also a huuuuuge Gorillaz fan. And I have seen
  them live. The show to their self titled debut. But don't get me
  wrong, that doesn't make me biased towards everything they put
  out. On the contrary it leaves me to judge them on a higher level
  because I only expect the best from what they've given. With that
  said, this has to be literally one of the best music DVDs I have
  encountered in quite some time. Don't worry about extras,
  documentaries, which while would have been nice to show how it
  was put together, are not here. Which makes sense since the band
  itself is very discreet they wouldn't show you all that. The show
  itself was amazing, and it literally jumps off screen as you
  watch this, and I recommend you have a decent audio system as
  well. The amazing sound quality coupled by the beautiful visuals
  is astonishingly done well. The editing and the post production
  were so well conceived they worked on this like a labour of love
  and not just another DVD to sell. From start to end it will leave
  you speechless. As you stare in awe at the grandioso that is the
  Gorillaz, you realise that while at first you figured them to be
  a fictious band in every aspect, they are quite real and very
  capable of producing grand music on every level. You can tell by
  this by the standing ovation and after the show and after the
  encore. Only few bands have ever been able to touch me musically
  on such a deep level. And to put on such a show which normally
  you could only catch at the studio over a period of months to
  produce is a feat in itself. If you want special features videos
  and documentaries get the 2 other DVDs especially now since they
  just released their newest one. Those will fill in all that
  nicely. But even if you're not a fan or just a new convert, I
  highly recommend you own this. No matter the age, or person you
  are, (you notice this on the DVD as well) and regardless of what
  your favourite genre is. Because they are so massive they can't
  be contained into one. Thank you Damon and Jamie for such an
  experience, mates</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">Flight from death is a "must see"
  documentary. I saw it three times since i've received the DVD
  last week and each time i discover new aspects. Images are
  beautiful and the commentary (narrated by Gabriel Byrne) is just
  outstanding. Before seeing it, i was a little bit anxious to see
  how they can translate in a documentary the rather complex
  thought of Ernest Becker. As a reader of Becker's books for many
  years i can tell that Patrick Sean and Greg Bennick had done a
  fantastic job. Each important parts of Becker's understanding of
  the impact of death anxiety on human behavior are explored and
  very well explained. I understand now why this documentary won
  seven prizes. Please do not hesitate to buy this DVD you won't
  regret it!</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">I did not have any of the original trilogy
  on DVD. I am happy to have the theatrical releases as I am not a
  fan of the SE's, particularly Jedi. I was nervous due to bad
  reviews, but they look and sound great. If you like Star Wars and
  want the original releases I highly recommend these. If you
  already happily own the SE's or are feeling cheated or robbed in
  some way by repeated releases of the same movie, then don't buy
  these.</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">Hollywood make them, then they break them --
  stars can fall as fast as they rise. Sometimes they rise again,
  and sometimes they disappear. And Christopher Guest casts a jaded
  eye on the fickle ups and downs of Hollywood in "The Big
  Picture," a quirky, cynical movie which focuses on what the
  successful should never let go of. It has a few awkward
  stretches, but overall it's a darkly witty cult comedy ("You're
  tracking failure all over my carpet!"). Nick Chapman (Kevin
  Bacon) is the winner at an arty student movie competition, and
  instantly agents are chasing him all over L.A. In no time, he's
  the Rising Young Director, with a movie deal at a major movie
  corporation. But he's also starting to lose sight of his old
  life, as he tries to become a major success. He changes the
  style, plot and characters of his arty movie for demographics,
  turning it into a beach bums/naked ghost movie. He dumps his
  pretty girlfriend (Emily Longstreth) for a bimbo actress (Teri
  Hatcher). When the studio head gets dropped, Nick falls as
  quickly as he rose. But a chance encounter with an old pal gives
  him a second chance -- an arty music video. This time, can he get
  it right? Christopher Guest is best known for his brilliant
  mockumentaries, tackling everything from small-town musicals to
  folk festivals. His forthcoming one is another one about showbiz.
  But his talents are just as present in a "typical" movie, and
  Guest does a smart, quirky job of it. The lesson: Be true to
  yourself and your art, don't fall for empty glitz, and don't let
  success go to your head if you're lucky enough to get it. The
  story is a pretty straightforward one -- Nick gets great success,
  it goes to his head, he falls, and he rises again a wiser man.
  And the movie falls into straightforward lines, without many
  unpredictable plot twists. At first glance, it doesn't seem that
  unusual. What makes it special? Well, simply put, Guest manages
  to infuse it with his unique type of wit, like the oddballish Pez
  music video and the noir fantasies of Nick's life. Not to mention
  the glorious dialogue. When speaking of Nick's one'n'only music
  video, a studio woman announces, "It's the best one yet, and I've
  seen 'em ALL!" And Guest manages to show us agents, artists,
  students, directors and actors, but never descended to cliches.
  They're real people, no matter how nasty. And Bacon does a solid
  job as a young man who learns how empty glitz is. His best scene
  is the reunion with his friend Emmet, where he confesses, "I
  wanna be your friend again." And he's backed by good performances
  by Longstreth, Michael McKean and a dancing Jennifer Jason Leigh.
  "Big Picture" treads where many movies have gone before, but it
  does so with an approach as fresh as a Pez People music video. A
  must-see</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">I was fourteen years old when I attended the
  New York Premier of this movie at the Rivoli Theater. I have the
  original Premier Book from the theater; which is NOT for sale. I
  immediately fell in love with the beautiful Ingrid Bergman. So
  did millions of other young men. This movie did not win the award
  of the year; it was overshadowed by "Casablanca"; which in my
  estimation, was of inferior quality, compared to For Whom the
  Bell Tolls. Bob Richard</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">This is a great film with a bad guy that you
  root for from start to finish. Action packed, and very smart.
  Great cast too</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">Terms of Endearment captivates me with the
  believable relationship of mother and daughter as brilliantly
  portrayed by Shirley MacLaine and Debra Winger. It covers
  approximately 30 years of the turbulent yet loving relationship
  between mom Aurora and daughter Emma. They have their
  differences; yet the love between them is always so obvious. It's
  also refreshing how they seem to be able to talk about anything
  with each other, even their sex lives. I've seen this movie
  several times, and everytime I cry at the end. In spite of the
  death, the movie ends on a positive note, giving us the feeling
  that life is going on and everything is going to be okay. The
  budding relationship between Aurora and her neighbor (also
  brilliantly portrayed by Jack Nicholson) creates a
  plot-within-a-plot that is very entertaining and provides some
  comic relief from the sadness of the relationship between Emma
  and her husband and children. The most interesting aspect is that
  Emma gets so bent out of shape when she finds out that her
  husband has been cheating on her, when she has been cheating on
  him as well. Somehow though we sympathize with Emma and her
  gentle lover (played by the very talented John Lithgow). We feel
  like they belong together and somehow their relationship doesn't
  seem wrong. If you are in the mood for a movie that is
  entertaining and gut-wrenching at the same time, this is a
  perfect choice</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">...but the movie was pretty good. I found
  myself highly disappointed in the book, and almost wasn't able to
  finish it. The characters were flat, the story reading like a
  history lesson in religion through the ages, and not a true
  story, so I wasn't sure what to make of the movie. I was
  pleasantly surprised though, to enjoy the movie immensely. It was
  long, but it kept the pace going throughout. The subtitling in
  the Latin and French was a bit mundane to drudge through, but it
  made the movie a bit more 'believable' than everyone speaking
  English when the main character is actually French. Teabing was
  played brilliantly, and while Hanks was not who I would have
  thought for Langdon, he did a superb job in the role. If you can
  set your personal beliefs aside and view the movie as a piece of
  exceptional fiction drama and suspense, it is well worth
  watching. Murder, mystery, suspense, action, drama... it's all
  there in this film</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">The BBC created the perfect cast in this
  terrific film. Watching it is like entering into a more pleasant
  world than the one that exists today. It is lavishly adorned with
  beautiful costume and sets. The latest adaptation is an insult to
  the major players in the BBC version. Highly recommend to those
  who love Jane Austin and her works</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">i haven't seen this movie in years so when i
  saw it at block- busters i had to rent it. my favorite part is
  when tom essex played by the handsome dana ashbrook put a
  screwdriver threw the head and the head said "get that damn
  screwdriver out of my head" i couldn't stop laughing it was so
  funny. i never really liked many horror-comedy movies but this
  one is really good. the best actor in this movie was dana
  ashbrook, he was not only funny but he was very brave and sexy to
  boot. if not many people liked this movie at lease watch it for
  his performance because he was amazing. he makes me want to watch
  it over and over and over again</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">I saw Transamerica months ago and I still
  think about it. There are many reasons, most obviously Felicity
  Huffman's portrayal of Bree, a man determined to become a woman,
  trying to close the door on his past, just as it unexpectedly
  reopens to disclose an heretofore unknown and decidedly lost
  child. But Transamerica also brings a funny, poignant, and at
  times visually beautiful road trip across the United States, in
  an old car that you wonder how it could make 50 miles, let alone
  3000. It brings unexpected and uncertain romance. It brings out
  humanity in all its characters (save one minor one), including
  Bree's bitter mother. Finally, it -- plot spoiler here --
  concludes with tentative reconciliation, acceptance, and an
  uncertain but potentially hopeful future. Transamerica is not
  loud, not big budget, not spectacular, but there are few movies
  near as good as it.</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">THIS IS A DVD THAT I THOUGHT WAS DATED. NOT!
  IT WAS MADE IN 2002/3, AND DESERVES WIDE VIEWING. I THOUGHT I MAY

  <Text category="dvd">Small town America... only this isn't the
  pleasant and white-picketed small town America of film noir fame,
  it's the gray and colorless small town America of neo-noir, and
  there's the man on the sidewalk looking like a lost bum to prove
  it. A bum who's being approached by that famous "Man in a Black
  Trenchcoat"... Hard Eight (AKA Sydney, but I've yet to see a
  version of it anywhere that actually claims that title) is a
  debut pretty much as promising as Blood Simple to the brothers
  Coen. Paul Thomas Anderson immediately sets out to give us only
  the best, with actors he wants to make famous and a script that
  has characters doing almost nothing we want (or expect) them to
  do, but who yet remain completely sympathetic throughout.
  Anderson also uses neo-noir color to great effect, allowing red
  and blue to do what harsh black and white contrast is supposed to
  do in classical noir. That said, Anderson still knows where the
  majority of the talent lies, and despite the long takes and
  steady-cam shots that would develop into those dizzying long
  takes from later movies, he focuses most of his time on the
  characters' faces, and just lets them be. If he hadn't already
  done the amazing and always stunning later work of Magnolia,
  Boogie Nights, and Punch Drunk Love, I'd say that this is a
  "promising debut that makes me impatient for the next Anderson
  picture to come out," but since he does now have four classics
  notched into his belt, I must say, "See this to see Anderson at
  his roots," and "Man I can't wait for his next feature!"

  <Text category="dvd">This movie was the first DVD I ever bought!
  It is truly a gem. I like the Infinifilm bonus features. (It may
  not have been called Infinifilm at this time.) Brett Ratner is
  truly a comedic genius, and really gives the customer great
  quality DVD's. The movie is funny and interesting enough. I
  enjoyed the scenes in several different locales. I enjoyed the
  physical interactions between Jackie and Chris Tucker. I think
  the stunts were wonderfully orchestrated. Jackie Chan is a genius
  at physical comedy. I highly recommend this DVD. Two thumbs up!!!

  <Text category="dvd">I have been following the Laughing Man
  fansubs, so I've covered all this material before. I'm acquiring
  the DVDs as they come out to have legit copies. The desc says 2
  collectibles toys, it's actually 3. There is Batou on the plate
  like Motoko from Vol 3. In fact, the base plates fit together,
  which makes me belive that vol 5 will have another piece that
  will fit together to complete a composite set. The other two toys
  are the Chinese assassin with the gun-arm and the old robot unit
  from the organ-farming business (with the fake southern accent).
  These are easier to put together, I had problems with the
  Tachikoma from the last set, it broke when I tried to put the
  legs on. Haven't gotten around to the super-glue session yet. The

  the best animation and smartest television ever produced. Buy it,
  share it with those persons worthy/capable of appreciating

  <Text category="dvd">I am a huge U2 fan and this is the BEST
  concert I have ever seen. This concert is simply unbeliveable. It
  proves to all those stupid people that the belief that U2 were
  only good in the 80s and 90s is a load of garbage. U2's still got
  it. This concert proves it. If you don't think U2's good anymore,
  go watch this concert. All that You Can't Leave Behind is a good
  album. Maybe not as good as Joshua Tree and Achtung Baby but it
  is still good. How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb left a little to
  be desired. And for the stupid guy at the beginning of these
  reviews (I think it was the first one) what do you mean Bono was
  supporting homosexuality??????????? When he kissed Edge, it was
  representing the betrayal of Jesus Christ. Look up the lyrics to
  the song that they were singing, "Until the End of the World." "I
  took the money... I kissed your lips (face in the concert) and
  broke your heart." Bono represents Judas Iscariot in the song.
  Also, if you still don't believe me and think this is some love
  song or something, watch any U2 concert with this song- almost
  all of them show Bono doing a little devil-horn thing, usually
  after kissing Edge (Christ) The only thing I agree with in that
  guy's review is that Edge really is the spirit of the band, not
  Bono. I love the delay that Edge uses in his guitar. And I hate
  how when people think of U2 they think of Bono. Bono's fine but I
  love how Edge plays. Anyway, go read his review if you want to
  find out more. Just don't listen to that homosexuality crap.
  Anyway, this concert is awesome and I could just watch it over
  and over again. In fact, I'm actually watching it tonight! Great
  show- makes you feel like you're actually there. U2 is a
  wonderful band with good Christian messages in their songs and I
  can't wait for their next album and concert to come out</Text>

  <Text category="dvd">This is a visually elegant and thematically
  frightening movie. It conjures up some authentically unearthly
  and mysterious atmosphere. Once agan the outstanding musical
  accompaniment of TOMANDANDY helps to elevate the film to a level
  of dread not seen since DON'T LOOK NOW back in '73. This was a
  strangely malinged and neglected film at the time of its release
  but i think history will mark it out, alongside WHITE NOISE, as
  the best of the thrillers that came out in the wake of The
  success of THE SIXTH SENSE.</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">I should say up front that I have never
  played chess, nor do I understand the game. But I remember being
  intrigued about the film when I saw the theatrical trailer. Was I
  intrigued because of the fact that the film was about a young boy
  with a special gift of a game? Was it the intense images of
  competition? Was it a curiosity about the game of chess itself
  and how it was played? Or was it about a deeper struggle within
  the boy? The answer is all of the above. "Searching For Bobby
  Fischer" is an excellent family film for all. I am living proof
  that even those who don't know jack about chess will love this
  movie. It is a movie not just about chess, but about acceptance,
  the bond of love and friendship, compassion for others, and not
  being afraid to be who you want to be. The balance of drama with
  edge-of-your-seat competition makes this a truly remarkable film.
  Max Pomeranc plays the young and sensitive Josh Waitzkin, a
  pint-sized seven-year old with a cute lisp, who becomes
  fascinated with the "lower class" men playing chess in a New York
  park. He watches the men, his eyes shifting with each move of the
  pieces. He convinces his mother to go to the park with him, where
  he plays a game of chess with an older gentleman. It is there
  that Josh's mother realizes her son has a knack for chess. Also
  noticing Josh is the fast-talking park chess player, Vinnie (a
  funny and great performance from Laurence Fishburne) who
  befriends the boy and eventually teaches him a thing or two about
  the game. After a match with Josh, Josh's father (played by Joe
  Mantegna) realizes his son's special gift and enlists the help of
  a stern but knowledgeable chess teacher named Bruce (played by
  Ben Kingsley) to make Josh an even better chess master. Bruce
  sees a young Bobby Fischer in Josh and cannot resist the
  temptation to take him under his wing and perhaps fill the void
  that Bobby Fischer left in the country after his mysterious
  disappearance. Through all the technical strategies of the game
  being learned, Josh and Bruce develop a good friendship and with
  Bruce's help, combined with his own special gift, Josh excels in
  chess tournaments and collects a shiny bundle of trophies. But
  there may be a test even harder than becoming a grand master of
  chess. We've all heard of parents trying to live their dreams
  through their children, especially when a parent sees a special
  gift in their child. But what happens when the thrill of
  competition and the persistent need to win cloud the parents'
  mind too much? And what happens when a beloved teacher wants you
  to be a carbon copy of someone or something that you're not?
  These are tests that run way deeper for Josh Waitzkin than any
  chess tournament. Josh learns quickly how addictive competition
  is and how obsessed people can become with a certain game. In his
  own way, the insightful Josh shows his father and teacher that he
  is not one of these people who lives and breathes chess like
  Bobby Fischer did. In the process, Josh pushes his father and
  teacher's feelings about him and the game of chess to the brink
  where they find they have to rethink their feelings. It's a
  matter of what is more important: chess competition, or love?
  Through it all, the three of them find that they can tolerate
  losing at chess but cannot tolerate losing something more dear;
  love and friendship for each other no matter what. There are some
  truly touching scenes in the film from the lecture Josh receives
  from his dad in the pouring rain, to the visit from his teacher
  at the Chicago tournament which comes toward the end of the show.
  But amongst the competition and drama, there are some nice comic
  scenes from Vinnie's trash talking against the others in the
  park, to the scene where the all the parents are literally locked
  up away from their kids during a tournament because they are so
  obnoxious, to the humorous appearance by William H. Macy when he
  offers to get Josh's dad a tuna sandwich. The climax comes in the
  huge chess championship at the end of the film where Josh takes
  Bruce and Vinnie's teachings along with his own style of playing
  and faces off against another chess prodigy named Jonathan.
  Jonathan is a boy I feel sorry for in the film. Playing since he
  was four years old, all Jonathan knows is chess and goes about
  life with a glazed expressionless look on his face. Perhaps this
  boy is proof of what living for a game can do to you, especially
  when you cannot just be a kid. The acting is terrific. Ben
  Kingsley, Max Pomeranc and Joe Mantegna give us a very touching
  and real performance in this film. It's too bad that Pomeranc did
  not act much since this film because he was a great little actor
  and very convincing. A nice touch to the movie is the real black
  and white film clips of a very young Bobby Fischer talking about
  and playing chess with Pomeranc narrating along. It gives us a
  bit of the history of the world's greatest chess player and also
  gives us the implication that people were searching for a new
  chess hero to fill the void when Bobby Fischer vanished; enter
  Josh Waitzkin. "Searching For Bobby Fischer" is one of those
  stand-up-and-cheer films that is perfect fun for the whole family
  with some valuable lessons to be learned as well! This is a movie
  you'll want to watch time and time again.</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">While this certainly isn't the best pearl
  jam concert ever it isn't the worst either. The first disc starts
  a little slow..but you can't argue with getting to hear song's
  like "In My Tree" and "Faithfull". Highlights are: Love Boat
  Captain...a nice opener. One of the best of riot act song's for
  sure. In My Tree, one of, if not my favorite pj songs. Not quite
  as rocking as the 2000 tour performances but still great. Gimme
  Some Truth. Maybe not a technically perfect perfomance but
  heartfelt and passionate. Good john lennon cover. Even Flow.
  Always great. Spin the black circle...the band starts to get more
  into the show after this rocking performance. Thumbing My
  Way...just a great slow song. Breath. In my opinion the best
  performance of the show...just great. Crown of Thorns. I really
  like this version of the song...played well whether you think ed
  should sing it or not. Baba O'Reilly. The classic "who" song. A
  great performance. Just try to sit still during this one. I would
  reccomend this dvd to anyone that is a pearl jam fan already but
  if you're not then I would start with some of their studio albums
  first.</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">This re-telling of the so-called "zoot suit
  riots" that rocked the Los Angeles homefront during World War II
  gets the facts right, but tells them rather poorly. Part of it is
  the super-stagey presentation, which basically is a filming of
  the play this was based on (right down to the shaking props and
  backdrops) and which takes little advantage of the possibilities
  of the film medium. Plus, Edward James Olmos is absolutely
  insufferable as the uber-symbolic Voice of The Barrio, although
  Daniel Valdez and Tyne Daly (!) are okay in their respective
  roles as a young man railroaded by the white establishment for a
  crime he did not commit, and as the commie agitator who comes to
  his defense. Anyone interested in the time period and in Chicano
  politics may benefit from watching this -- I rented it while
  doing some reseach on the "pachucho" R&amp;amp;B music scene --
  but in dramatic and filmic terms, this is not a first-rate
  production. It's hammy and ham-fisted. Latter-day star spotting:
  El Teatro Campesion veteran Robert Beltran (of future "Star Trek
  Voyager" notoriety) has a bit role as a modern-day audience
  member..</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">Cast: Denzel Washington, John Goodman,
  Donald Sutherland, Embeth Davidtz, James Gandolfini, Elias
  Koteas, Gabriel Casseus, Michael J. Pagan. Running Time: 123
  minutes Rated R for violence and language. "Fallen" starts with
  convicted serial killer Edgar Reese (Elias Koteas) being executed
  in the gas chamber as the man who brought him to justice
  Detective Jon Hobbes (Denzel Washington) looks on. Hobbes thinks
  that this is the end but soon has to rethink as he receives a
  phone call which tells him to check a house out where he finds a
  dead man named Muscovich (Glen Witko) in a bathtub having been
  poisoned, the same way Reese used to kill his victims. At first
  Hobbes fears a copy cat killer but during the course of his
  investigation the name Robert Milano comes up, a decorated cop
  who apparently committed suicide. Hobbes speaks with his daughter
  Gretta (Embeth Davidtz) who at first is reluctant to speak with
  him. Things become even stranger when the man who killed
  Muscovich, Charles (Robert Joy) is found dead in exactly the same
  way having been poisoned again. Eventually Gretta tells Hobbes
  the truth, he is in fact dealing with an ancient demon called
  Azazel who has the power to jump form body to body at will by
  mere psychical touch. The demon Azazel seems to be taunting
  Hobbes, ruining his life &amp;amp; career, setting him up for
  murder &amp;amp; getting to his friends &amp;amp; family. Hobbes
  must find a way to destroy the ancient demon before it destroys
  him &amp;amp; everyone he cares about. Charismatic leading man
  Denzel Washington is suitably cast as the protagonist and proves
  to have range, while John Goodman is okay but greatly underused
  while the same applies to James Gandalfini who plays almost the
  exact same character. Donald Sutherland doesn't prove to have any
  range, doing the usual gruff routine that he does in nearly all
  of his movies. Embeth Davidtz is a talented and totally
  under-rated actress. She delivers a good performance and shows
  great potential for the future. The directing and camera work in
  this movie was superb. It was done in such a way where you can
  see Azazel's spirit go from person to person simply by following
  the camera up and down the crowd and watching the subtle touches
  one makes in a normal walk about town. Although this film does
  require your full attention, it does not go unrewarded and you
  are not left at the end scratching your head wondering what had
  happened for the past two hours. "Fallen" is an intelligently
  written, supremely efficiently executed, and one of the most
  unheralded, unnoticed thrillers of the late part of the decade.
  One of the better of its kind</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">Thank heaven for Larry David and Curb Your
  Enthusiam, or there would be nothing brilliantly entertaining and
  provocative to watch that wasn't political, except South Park
  &amp;amp; Reno 911, which are really in a different league
  altogether</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">all things aside, the other kid in the movie
  the caddie friend that has the episode at the end [stated this
  way without ruining the ending]played a great part as a
  supporting actor. his name is justin goncalves i think. this kid
  was very believable in every aspect of the part he played. in
  fact i think he stole the scenes when he was onscreen with the
  gamble kid. believability is important and this kid carried his
  weight the entire movie for what limited scenes he had. i was
  particularly impressed with the part he played.</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">I watched this film at the suggestions of a
  friend...Had to watch it again the very next night and have seen
  it several times since. It's so nice to watch a film where people
  are acutally nice to each other and there is no offensive
  language or elicit scenes. Just recently learned of some friends
  in a very similar situation and recommended the film to them to
  help work throught the emotions they are having. Livvy, a young
  and educated woman finds herself pregnant shortly following the
  death of her mother. The father of her baby leaves the scene and
  Livvy's father insists that she will not have a child out of
  wedlock and so arranges her marriage to a lonely farmer in a very
  rural area of Colrado. Ray (the farmer) is shy and reserved, but
  was brought up with high moral values and treats Livvy like she
  is something special. The rest of the movie develops the story of
  how Ray and Livvy get acquainted and eventually fall in love,
  even though that was not Livvy's original intention. I think the
  film has a powerful message about forgiveness and forbearance. I
  have purchased several copies and love to share it with friends.
  I HIGHLY recommend it!!!!</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">This one of those movies that I can watch
  over and over again. The story is great, acting is good, and
  seeing the jerks get it in the end is the best. The force of
  nature is just amazing to me and given the opportunity I would
  love to go on a Tornado hunt. The special effects in the movie
  are very well done and realistic and the ending is perfect for
  this movie. I would of given this one 5 stars but it has to be
  one heck of a movie for 5 stars. The loss of a star is for some
  of the actors average job at there parts. Rent it, buy it, watch
  it! It is well worth your time and money.</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">I absolutely love this movie! It's one of my
  favorites and I could watch it over and over. It's got good plot,
  good acting and great child stars. I'd recommend this movie to
  ANYONE to hasn't seen it yet (if there is any such person)</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">I enjoyed this wholeheartedly. Mainly
  because wwe did a little tweak on the formula. Instead of
  mimicking the one-time use of the Flair dvd formula or using the
  formula that everyone else gets this three disc sets spreads
  everything around. All the featured stars get their own video
  package highlighting parts of their career that made them famous
  or recognizable. Then every wrestler gets their own match, some
  of which overlap which makes things interesting. Although we do
  see some perennial "best of" favorites it was nice to see some
  obscure pieces of footage. Who would have guessed Sal Bellomo
  would be on a dvd in the 2000's. If wwe continues releases with
  rarer footage, I think they'll have a better chance at impressing
  the older members of the fanbase</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">I purchased this DVD because it said it was
  an easier pilates video to do; basically anyone, even beginners,
  could do it. I have to disagree. I started this video and tried
  to do all of the 5, ten minute sections. It wasn't completely
  hard, but definitely challenging. I am not the most fit person,
  but also not the most unfit. I had a harder time because I am
  just not as limber as you should be to use this pilates video. I
  am not saying I wouldn't suggest it, I am just saying it's not
  definitely for beginners. However, the instructions are clear and
  since it's broken up into the five-ten minute sections it gets
  even lazy people like me to get off the couch and do it</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">Great improvements over the original DVD.
  Enhanced for 16x9 TVs with scenes that are now clearer and
  actually 2.35:1 widescreen ratio. The original dvd claims an
  aspect ratio of "approximately 2.35:1" which was not true. I own
  both versions and have compared viewing aspects of each. Clearly
  this DVD is far superior and well worth the purchase price. This
  plays very well on my HDTV monitor; I'll give the old version to
  someone w/ an old 4x3 TV.</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">Not very familiar with Noam Chomsky's work
  but I have listened to many people say that he has very strong
  arguments. This film is proof of those arguments. Noam Chomsky
  has facts, refers to original sources, provides context and
  analysis and leaves you feeling that you have heard a very solid
  and well-research argument. This film is a collection of such
  arguments on issues and events affecting many of us in the world.
  America's invasion of Iraq, the war on terror and what is behind
  it other than 9-11, and other topics are rich and insightful.
  This film provides a nice balance on Chomsky by giving us some
  insight into HIM which is interesting. I find him more
  fascinating now than I did as a skeptic who was challenged to
  actually read his material. This film gives those new to Noam
  Chomsky's books an excellent overview of the issues and events
  that he has written about in the last five years or so. After
  watching this film I went out and read 9-11 and his latest book.
  While good, the film gives us the same information but in a more
  direct and candid manner.</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">Having an M.A. in English literature as well
  as a B.A. in literature and history, anytime a movie is BOTH
  historical AND literary . . . well, I get a bit excited to say
  the least. I don't wish to give the impression that this movie is
  based on absolute and authentic history because it's not, but the
  writers/directors/producers set it against a "historical"
  backdrop nonetheless. On that note, this is yet another stellar
  title from noneother than Ridley Scott. With that being said, I
  enjoyed "Tristan and Isolde" almost as much as "Gladiator" and a
  bit more than "Kingdom of Heaven" (all of these, by the way, are
  Ridley Scott films). Notice the historical adaptations here?
  While it may be true that the story of Tristan and Isolde was
  inspirational to Shakespeare's "Romeo and Juliet" as well as
  possibly fueling much of the intrigue of the Arthurian legend,
  this movie is not exclusively for the high-browed college types.
  No sir, good ol' red-blooded men and women will certainly be
  drawn into both the action as well as the romance in this movie.
  This is by no means a "chick flick" since there is present a
  large degree of bloodshed and overall suspense. On the other
  hand, it's not the typical "hack and slash" macho film because at
  its core is a very dynamic love story. In short, it should please
  both sexes simultaneously. Aside from James Franco (Tristan), I
  was rather unfamiliar with most of the cast. Sophia Myles
  (Isolde) is, for the most part, a newcomer to American audiences
  despite a rather large resume in mostly British films. I suspect
  this film will provide her the recognition she certainly deserves
  on this side of the Atlantic. While many of the other characters
  were convincing in their roles, no other character was more
  believable in his villainy than that of the arrogant Irish king
  (who just so happens to be Isolde's father). In short, this is
  one of the best movies I've seen in awhile. On some levels it
  reminds me of "King Arthur." Just as "King Arthur" attempted to
  provide a plausible history of the legendary Arthur, Guinevere,
  and Lancelot, so too does Ridley Scott by placing the action a
  few years after the establishment of the Angle and Saxon kingdoms
  in England. If you'll recall in "King Arthur," Arthur helps hold
  back the onslaught of the invading Saxons just as the Roman
  legions were exiting Britannia. Historians will point out that
  there is no evidence of Saxons in England until several decades
  AFTER the Roman withdrawal, but oh well . . . it made for a good
  story. Here, we witness the Celtic Britons as they are exploited
  by the Irish across sea. WHAT???? The Irish doing the exploiting
  and not the other way around? Well, "Tristan and Isolde" holds
  true to history in this aspect; namely, that the Celtic Britons
  of England were indeed pushed to the easternmost shores of the
  island after the coming of the Anglo-Saxons. This would, of
  course, have placed them in what is now Wales and Cornwall. And
  this is exactly where the movie is set. Let's not forget the
  story of Saint Patrick. Remember, he was actually a Romanized
  Briton who was captured and served as a slave in Ireland before
  escaping and ultimately returning to Ireland to convert the
  populace to Christianity. It's interesting to note that in the
  movie Christianity is a fairly new-fangled religion in Ireland,
  so no doubt Ridley Scott intended this to remind us of the time
  period at hand. I particulary liked "King Arthur" and "Kingdom of
  Heaven" despite the lukewarm reception they received from the
  critics. Critically speaking, "Tristan and Isolde" has been a bit
  of a mixed bag as well---but who really bases their decision to
  watch a movie on the arrogant views of movie critics? Rent it
  first if you must, but I suspect this one will be a "keeper" in
  your DVD library!</Text>

  <Text category="dvd">This movie is one of my personal favorites
  and probably one of rob reiners best directionals masterpeices.
  he hit the time, the place and the kids perfectly. this movie
  appealed to me as these kids were such good friends and ive never
  had a relationship that they all share, i find that real
  friendship is something worth looking for and after about 10
  billoin cases of friends becoming eneimies for me... this movie
  really pointed out to me that its the type of relationship and
  the way you fell with others that makes having frineds that best
  thing in the world. i can only hope that i can find friends as
  good as these kids someday. its a great movie and i'd recommend
  it to anyone. you might have to look past the constant crying and
  deep emotions since it might seem a little fake but thats what
  this movie is all about.... growing up and not many kids these
  days are willing to share how they feel with each other which
  isn't as bad as it sounds. plus great script/dialog and a great
  tone and atomashperehope then rest of you have noticed that
  aswell. Its also the only movie that made me realize that i
  wouldnt mind living in the 1950's over this era.</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">I'll start by saying all those people who
  think that american animated series are as good as it gets
  animation wise have been living under a rock since this series
  started 11 DVDS ago, and it continues with this volume. As for
  the episodes themselves, They were a good addition to the season
  because with the next two discs, everything comes to a head and
  resolves. Looking back on the four episodes, the only perceivable
  problem was that there was no real explanation as to why the
  major and batou were compelled to go to berlin with everything
  that was going on at home in Japan. This was not enough for a
  point deduction. At the end of the day, anyone who likes a good
  series or animation that is technically perfect shoud buy this
  discs and all of the discs from both seasons. You will not be
  disappointed.</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">This DVD possesses some of the best editing

  <Text category="dvd">I have owned a copy of this film for a long
  time. I have probably watched it ten times, and I always tear up
  a little at each viewing. From the beginning newsreel, of a
  shell-shocked Diane Feinstein announcing the less than hour old
  murders of Harvey Milk and Mayor George Moscone, to the final
  reel of Harvey Milk's prophetic and haunting statements, the
  viewer is mesmerized. Though Harvey Milk was a San Francisco city
  supervisor, his election in the 1970's, that of an open and
  unrepentant gay man, made national headlines . He was a ray of
  hope to gay people everywhere, who at that time were
  unrepresented and, for the most part, still forced into the
  closet. This film not only gives insight into the philosiphy of
  Harvey Milk, but is a rare document into that not so long ago but
  seemingly ancient time. Milk was a very eloquent speaker, and his
  sensibility, logic, and unapologetic viewpoint more often than
  not made mincemeat of any verbal opponent. This is best displayed
  in the footage of his debate with then California Senator Briggs,
  a buffoon like character, who not only was a terrible speaker,
  who couldn't even clearly express his arguably irrational fears,
  but who in fact seemed much prissier than his nemesis Milk. The
  public view at that time was about family values, with the Anita
  Bryants condeming homosexuals to Hell for their decadent ways
  (Old times come round again....). Milk's voice opposed this view
  openly, and he seemed to predict his early demise at the hands of
  an assassin who was against what he represented. The notion of
  this martyrdom, and its romantic though fateful attraction to
  Milk, has been argued. Nevertheless, his bravery in representing
  the unrepresented cannot be argued, and the sordid details of his
  love affairs and personal life should not diminish his message,
  nor the admiration he deserves. This film unfolds as it happened,
  seeming like fiction, but all too real. As Milk is assassinated,
  along with the Mayor, by the homophobic and disgruntled resigned
  supervisor Dan White, whose subsequent trial, with the famous
  "Twinkie Defense", and his being sentenced to an appalling five
  years for the murders, resulted in riots the likes of which the
  city had never seen. As one of those interviewed here expresses
  with sad resignation,... if only the Mayor had been killed, White
  would have gotten life, but the fact that Milk, a gay man, had
  also been killed, leaned public sympathy towards White, an absurd
  but all too realistic conclusion.There are many moving, telling,
  historically signifigant moments in this film, but none so
  clearly represents those times, and Milk's loss and legacy, as
  the film of the nighttime march in San Francisco right after the
  murders. Seas of people, holding candles and standing silently,
  came together in a very moving moment in time. This film, which
  won best documentary at that years Oscars, transcends its subject
  matter, and is simply a great documentary. Gay rights have made
  much progress. And perhaps time has diminished their names and
  these memories to most all, excluding those who were there, are
  old enough to remember , or are gay. Nonetheless, Harvey Milk is
  a representive and icon of the early gay rights movement, and his
  legacy, through schools named after him, organizations, and his
  place in history as a voice for the all too often voiceless,
  lives on.</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">All of these bad reviews confuse a movie
  they didn't like with a badly made movie. This is a very well
  made movie, with perfectly competent performances. The tone is
  quite serious, and the ending won't cheer anyone up. But then
  there are many people who loved Titanic, which I found utterly
  depressing. More to the point, though, who cares about the
  problems of these rich kids? Not me. The REAL reason to watch
  this is to see Molly Ringwald at her most beautiful. And if you
  enjoy this film, check out Less Than Zero, another gloomy but
  solid (&amp;amp; underrated) '80s film. The WORST '80s film is
  Bright Lights, Big City - don't say I didn't warn you!</Text>

  <Text category="dvd">A true love-it-or-hate-it movie: my reaction
  fits closer with the first group. This gritty look at the dark
  side of the drug culture plays like an open wound. The parallel
  stories chronicle a widow who descends into an addiction to diet
  pills, while her son tries to make a living dealing, although he,
  his partner, and his girlfriend smoke and snort a lot of the
  profits. The director's jarring style fits the subject matter
  well, and Ellen Burstyn's performance as the diet pill addict is
  nothing short of amazing. Julia Roberts beat her for Best Actress
  in 2000 with Erin Brockovich, which was a fine role and
  performance, but Burstyn was in another world. Those who hate the
  film will complain about the style and whether the events at the
  end make any sense. I can understand the second objection, hence
  four stars rather than five. Note: I got this movie from
  Netflix--I'm not sure if I was watching the director's cut or
  not</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">The is a tragic but very true to life
  depiction of the degradation caused by addiction to individuals,
  families, and society. The film is graphic in its depiction of
  addiction, but as an addiction counselor, who is an addict and
  alcoholic in recovery, it is very close to actual tragic events I
  have seen in the world of addiction. The emotionally disturbing
  events that take place in the lives of the main characters are
  exactly the very real things that addiction counselors are
  seeking to prevent. These events are the end of untreated or
  unchecked addiction for far too many. Unfortunately, even though
  some of the content may be offensive to some, it is a starkly
  true depiction of what the reality for some addicts becomes. Even
  though the film may leave one emotionally upset for a time, it is
  a worthwhile film to break through false pretenses about
  addiction's final results and the glossing over of the
  degradation addiction can and does lead to in real life. Watch
  and learn the truth about severe addiction</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">Simply the most entertaining mockumentary /
  film I've seen in years and one of the best ever. The DVD is
  packed full of extras and outtakes so the fun lasts much longer
  than you'd expect. Jenna Fischer is brilliant and James Gunn is
  hilarious. You just have to buy it to understand</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">They just don't have movies like this
  anymore. This is not a movie that makes Charlie Sheen or Tom
  Berenger appeal to the young audiences who like flashy stars on
  sceen. This is amovie to show you the reality of war and
  experiences that happened to people in the past. Charlie Sheen
  stars as a man who volutarily goes to war. This seems odd and he
  figures out why everyone was looking at him so weird when he was
  telling them this later in the movie. He finds out alright. Keith
  David plays his friend who tries to keep his spirits up and this
  is definitely his best role. He cheers him up in a great scene
  where they get extremely baked. The supporting cast in this movie
  is unbelievable and no flat performances here. Overall this is my
  favorite movie of all time. It has stood the test of time and
  never fails when I want to see a good movie. I just have the old
  special edition, not the 20th anniversary but the extras are very
  nice. It has a commentary from the direcotor and a seperate one
  from the military advisor who worked on the film. There is also a
  lengthy doumentary about the making of and when I saw this I was
  mroe than glad I got the special edition. You would nto believe
  what the actors went through! It is a great making of.</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">I was introduced to the Matthew Shepard
  story by MTV's dramatic presentation of Matthew's last days in
  Laramie. With that as my background, I entered The Laramie
  Project with curiosity regarding the reactions of Laramie's
  townspeople to this tragedy that received national attention.
  Matthew was a human being, undeserving of the cruel torture that
  led to his death. Shameless hatred was definitely reflected by
  several Laramie residents, but not everyone shared that view.
  That fact was refreshing. The law enforcement officer who freed
  Matthew from the fence at the scene of the crime was incredibly
  sympathetic. Her personal views concerning his lifestyle were not
  revealed, but her view of this youth as an innocent victim of a
  horrific crime were apparent. Other Laramie residents were just
  as horrified. The so-called clergyman who brazenly expressed a
  heartless sentiment to one of the interviewers was expected, but
  equally unnerving. This film, though actors portrayed the
  townspeople interviewed, has the feel of a documentary. Knowing
  that the expressions were accurate was alarming at times. But the
  presentation was enlightening. The film addressed the fact that
  hate crimes are just that - crimes. No matter what a person's
  viewpoint, lifestyle or background, no one has a right to take on
  the position of punisher. Humans are not animals. Or, at least
  they shouldn't act like them. The Laramie Project exposes the
  heart of many people after the Matthew Shepard murder. It is
  worth the watch</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">Maybe it helps to be unfamiliar with
  Chekov's work and therefore have no preconceived notions, but I
  found this British made drama to be absorbing and quietly
  powerful in depicting the sadness and futility of pre-revolution
  Russia. The story of a once wealthy family slowly accepting their
  loss of prestige and slendor blooms like a beautiful but lonely
  rose, and thankfully the depths of the drama never get very
  sloppy, sentimental, or even tragic</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">This film was probably hurt a bit by the
  fact it had to have its fall 2001 release postponed due to
  9/11(it's plot included terrorists that sell a bomb). I also
  imagine the marketing was tough since it had to be sold based on
  Tim Allen and the comparisons to "Get Shorty" rather than as a
  plot driven movie. I tell you though, this film is simply funny.
  Just like an old Marx Brothers film, the plot is there only to
  set in motion the quick-witted dialogue and interaction between
  the characters. I have enjoyed both of Dave Barry's humor
  novels(this and "Tricky Business"). They made me laugh out loud
  as did this movie. I think it captures the spirit of the book
  perfectly. For those that have laughed at Dennis Farina from his
  roles in "Get Shorty and even "Snatch," he has never been funnier
  as a hit man who encounters unexpected roadblocks(literally) on
  his trip to do a quick sniper job. Tom Sizemore is also excellent
  as the dumbest crook you'll ever see. There are some movies that
  you may see once in the theaters yet can watch over and over
  everytime it is on tv because it retains the ability to always
  make you laugh, no matter how many times you have seen it. Check
  this one out!</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">well, Season 5 for me was a little bit of a
  dissappointment but still contain the character plot line (or the
  theme as many will call it) of Southpark itself. Since buying
  this i watched it alot in the first month or two then dropped
  off. My interest in Southpark was revisited with Season 6 (also
  available on DVD) However, If you like South Park or love it this
  is for you of course without saying. However, If you just joining
  in you might want to get the package with the first 5 seasons all
  together, but this season was good</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">This 1971 black comedy is still a stitch,
  even if it doesn't feel as audacious as I'm sure it once did.
  Directed by the maverick Hal Ashby, it is the epitome of all
  opposites-attract love stories as a twenty-year old depressive
  connects with a 79-year old life-loving woman. They actually bond
  over their mutual interest in death, as they keep showing up at
  the same funerals. However, the root of their respective
  interests couldn't be more different - Maude shows up to
  reconfirm how lucky she feels to be alive, while the
  hearse-driving Harold simply likes the morbidity of it all. The
  plot is really about their burgeoning relationship, while his
  mother constantly attempts to make the death-obsessed Harold more
  socially acceptable. First, she uselessly sets him up on a series
  of blind dates. To foil any hope of romance with these women,
  however, he stages mock-suicides which simply perturbs rather
  than disturbs his mother. She then recruits an ineffectual
  analyst and even has her brother Victor, a hawkish officer and
  Vietnam War amputee, to try to convince Harold to join the Army.
  The episodic structure of the story by Collin Higgins (years
  before becoming a director in his own right with "Foul Play" and
  "Nine to Five") allows the characters to develop in subtle ways
  with a completely deadpan approach despite the outward
  shenanigans of the characters' actions. The movie eventually
  moves toward a greater gravitas but despite some soap opera
  elements, surprisingly not at the expense of the pervasive
  whimsical tone. Ruth Gordon is her typically pixilated self, an
  archetype she played for years afterward, while Bud Cort is
  terrific in conveying his particular brand of wide-eyed cynicism.
  It's really their unforced chemistry that keeps the film feeling
  fresh 35 years later. There are funny sideline performances by
  Vivian Pickles as Harold's eye-rolling mother, Ellen Geer as an
  overly actressy blind date named Sunshine, and Eric Christmas in
  a very funny cameo as a disapproving priest. Cat Stevens'
  soundtrack hasn't aged as well as, say, Simon and Garfunkel's
  music in "The Graduate", but it still works as a folkish
  commentary on the quirky proceedings. Unfortunately, the 2000 DVD
  contains a rather compromised print and there are no extras
  included</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">I saw this film a few years back on TV and
  really enjoyed it, but I notice it is presented in full screen
  format. Is this the correct aspect ratio? I hate to buy a botched
  pan/scan version....can anyone help me out??????</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">I like this season because it has moved out
  of the developing storyline and gone into conflicting with each
  other with two of the best twist in a show ever!</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">Truly frightening, gruesome, a gore-fest, a
  bloodbath, AND it has a plot... really, there are a lot of
  clich&#239;&#191;&#189; expressions to describe this movie but
  they're all true: It's a HORROR movie in the true sense of the
  word. I hadn't seen a Rob Zombie movie before this one, but I
  would have to say, after seeing it, that it's got to be his
  masterpiece. I don't see how he could top it. "House of 1000
  Corpses" is NOT a movie that people who don't like the genre
  should be watching. I don't think they'd be able to stomach it.
  It's a downward spiral of evil, depredation, degradation and
  mayhem out of an imagination that must be really SICK (but
  awesome). The sense of humor in the movie actually doesn't spoil
  it, it just makes it better, it's so malicious. The atmosphere,
  the acting, the special effects and makeup, everything
  contributes to an hour-and-a-half long ride through a freak show
  that shouldn't be missed by true horror-movie buffs. Buy it, rent
  it, whatever. If you love being scared, you'll love this movie.
  It delivers!</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">This movie is great. I just bought it the
  other day and rushed home to watch it. I throughly enjoyed it
  entirely, I believe it kind of relates to Fatal Attraction</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">you gotta get the whole series....you can't
  just get one or two dvds...you need the whole thing, trust me.
  Once you start you gotta go all the way to the end</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">I saw this movie in theaters probably when
  it first came out in 2001, but I didn't pay too close attention,
  because I forgot about it. However, I remembered seeing it in
  theaters one day when I was browsing the DVD section, and decided
  to give it another shot at home. I am so glad I did! Leelee
  Sobieski is absolutely gourgeous and did a flawless job with the
  film. She has a bright future in acting ahead of her. Basically
  what happens is, Ruby (Sobieski) and her brother Rhett's (Trevor
  Morgan) parents die in a car accident. Their parents wished for
  them to go live with the family's former neighbors, the Glasses,
  (who had since moved to Malibu) played by Stellan Skarsgard and
  Diane Lane. Needless to say, Ruby and Rhett's carefree lives are
  changed dramatically. Rhett falls for all the gifts that the
  Glasses buy for him, but Ruby isn't fooled so easily. She begins
  to suspect that her parents' death wasn't an accident, and starts
  to investigate. She sees certain things and observes certain
  behaviors exhibited by the Glasses that only make her more
  suspicious. Eventually, she figures out that the Glasses are
  behind the car accident and are now after Ruby and Rhett's 4
  million dollar fortune that was left to them by their parents. I
  won't give away the rest, but the movie takes you on a roller
  coaster ride of excitement and suspense that will keep you on the
  edge of your seat until the last second! Rent it, or better yet,
  buy it! It's well worth your while!</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">this is a great movie and I got it sent to
  me in a reasonable time and it was a wonderful service thank you
  very much</Text>

  <Text category="dvd">At last! A full-length Jimmy Buffett concert
  on DVD! It's been a while coming but this is a beauty. There are
  so many highlights it's hard to know where to start - perhaps the
  best place is the overall quality of the DVD. The sound is
  superb, the camera-work spot on and the real essence of a Jimmy
  Buffett concert is captured perfectly. The song mix is terrific -
  everything from Buffett classics like Volcano, to new classic
  like Piece Of Work, to iconic covers like Southern Cross. Seeing
  Jimmy and the Coral Reefers perform in daylight and night-time is
  a nice touch and the crowd shots show why a Buffett concert is
  such an all-encompassing experience! For me, a favourite moment
  is the concert finale of Steve Goodman's City Of New Orleans.
  Steve now resides under home plate at Wrigley and I'm sure he was
  singing along as well. Buffett fans and new Parrotheads alike
  will find this DVD one to watch many times over</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">Georges Seurat was totally insane by the age
  of 32. Knowing that helps Stephen Sondheim's genius show through.
  Sunday in the Park with George is an amazing show about the life
  of this manic artist, and the fictional personalities of the
  figures in his painting "A Sunday Afternoon on the Island of La
  Grande Jatte". The first Act is completely devoted to a set of
  Sundays spanning 2 years of Seurat's life and the end of his
  relationship with a long-time lover. The dramatic and touching
  songs make you feel for this hard-nosed painter yet comical
  points shine through. The second act takes place 100 years later
  in 1984 with the Great-grandson of Georges (also played by Mandy
  Patinkin) doing a tribute to the painting that brought his
  relative so much posthumous fame. Like other Sondheim shows it is
  at times long-winded, but altogether entirely enjoyable. Mandy
  and Mrs. Peters' voice have so much emotion and power that, with
  the correct sound system, you are carried to the brink of pure
  delight and insanity by their performances. With Commentary from
  the actors and producers this is an essential for one who
  collects musicals</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">Having drooled over the Goodtimes dvd for
  years now, I did a flip and a half when I saw Universal was
  releasing a widescreen dvd of this superhot love story. I
  refrained from doing two flips when I remembered it was Universal
  and then saw no mention of special features. What? Look at the
  potential for bonuses! There was an alternate ending, there were
  deleted scenes, how about a featurette?! Argh! I just wept and
  wept. And then months later the release date comes, I tear the
  dvd open and the movie starts automatically - I hit menu and get
  the nagging old "operation prohibited by disc" usually reserved
  for fast forwarding through those tired old FBI warnings. There's
  not even a menu! No scene selection. Geez. Do these corporate
  monoliths now require movies to be no older than 5 days old to
  have simple menus? I'd like to sit down and analyze the
  brilliance of Sarandon and Spader, note how Spader's hair changes
  near the end because of reshoots, but I'm just too raving mad at
  Universal right now.</Text>

  <Text category="dvd">such a kiddie classic..so cute im 22 and had
  to have this because i loved it as a ki</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">this dvd is the authorotizzle on the
  technizzle. fo schizzle</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">I'll start out by saying that I prefer the
  Jason movies. I think the whole body count is a fun way to watch
  a horror movie. The Freddy movies are good horror movies, but
  they're not really slashers like I thought they would be. - A
  Nightmare on Elm Street - A great, classic horror movie by Wes
  Craven. He creates good high school characters, although trying
  to prove that they're only 15 years old is a little far-fetched.
  Freddy is more horrific and scary, he doesn't say much. - A
  Nightmare on Elm Street 2: Freddy's Revenge - They were asking
  for it when they completely changed the style and rules of Freddy
  in this sequel. Many will disagree, but I don't think it's a bad
  movie, it's just very dark and horrific. - A Nightmare on Elm
  Street 3: Dream Warriors - Definately a step up from Part 2. It
  goes back to the roots of the original film and brings back
  Nancy, who is now studying dreams and sleep in a mental hospital.
  The style brings us back to the original movie with the same
  rules and objectives. - A Nightmare on Elm Street 4: The Dream
  Master - Decent entry in the series carrying over characters from
  #3 and introducing all new characters. The story doesn't flow as
  easily this time around and it's a step down from Part 3, but
  still good. - A Nightmare on Elm Street 5: The Dream Child -
  Stephen Hopkins' visual style makes this the best sequel in the
  series. Freddy is hilarious and the special effects are great.
  The story is more interesting than Part 4 and the characters have
  matured since that movie which is good. - Freddy's Dead - The
  Final Nightmare - Cheesy storyline trying to tell us that in 10
  years there will be no kids left in an American town? Rachel
  Talalay thinks the 3-D effects in the film are lame, but not that
  story element? If it weren't for the interesting backstory on
  Freddy, this wouldn't be a good movie. - Wes Craven's New
  Nightare - Wes Craven did succeed in making an interesting and
  well made horror movie here, but it is a little strange to
  include it in the rest of the series. Better watched on its own
  and not consecutively with the other movies. - Nightmare
  Encyclopedia - Alot of interviews that aren't edited very
  interestingly make for a decent special features disk. It's good
  to see that these interview aren't self serving at all and
  they're completely retrospective, it would've been nice to hear
  more from Heather Langenkamp, or possibly Johnny Depp? This is a
  great set for extreme fans and a good set for casual fans. I'm a
  huge fan of the Alien series and a pretty big fan of the Predator
  series, but not as much as Alien. I would say that I'm now a huge
  fan of Jason and a good sized fan of Freddy in comparison to
  Alien/Predator. I do recommend these movies, but this enormous
  box with annoying cardboard cases is outdated for today</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">For a plot synopsis please read the Amazon
  review. I wish to talk about the reasons why you will love this
  film. As a longtime fan of both Sam Raimi (of the Evil Dead
  series) and Bill Paxton (Aliens, Twister), I went to see this on
  opening night. Not many people can claim this I'm sure because it
  was and is, such a small film that received next to no marketing.
  For shame. This film is in the best tradition of modern film noir
  including BLOOD SIMPLE and FARGO, both made by the Cohen
  brothers. Film buffs will be able to draw the connections to
  those films and their filmakers, so I won't bother to get into
  that. Should you have seen either of these films and enjoyed
  them, I suggest you stop reading and immediately rent A SIMPLE
  PLAN. If not, keep reading and I will try to express why this
  film is so remarkably brilliant. And why I hope you will take a
  look at it. A SIMPLE PLAN is, at its core, about four people. And
  underneath all the plot devices and twists, it's about how they
  relate to one another. Notice I did't say characters, because
  this film doesn't have actors simply delivering dialogue. It's
  about people you get to know, understand and sympathise with as
  they undergo the most brutal of dilemmas. Sure, finding a
  mysterious bag filled with money is an excellent plot device, but
  the heart of this film is much simpler than that. It's about the
  basic human flaw of committing a criminal act and trying to
  weasel your way out of it. And being forced to do the most
  unthinkable things in the process. That's what gives this film
  such depth. You watch these people try to figure out how to cover
  every angle so they can get away with stealing a whole lot of
  cash. And in the end it falls apart for two reasons: the details
  and the human factor. They say the Devil is in the details and
  this is never truer than with a crime. As for the human factor,
  where greed is concerned, people cannot trust one another because
  they fear the other person's greed while are unable satisfy their
  own. In many respects this film is almost an homage to BLOOD
  SIMPLE and FARGO, but in many ways I think it is superior. I
  often draw the comparison by a scene which is both A SIMPLE PLAN
  and BLOOD SIMPLE where a body is increasingly difficult to
  dispose of. And even afterwards, after the emotional toll the has
  been taken, once one evil act is committed, another is sure to
  follow. It's so painfully facsinating to watch a person work out
  their problem on camera, frantically going over the details in
  their mind, all the while their heart is beating a mile a minute.
  Bill Paxton does this better than anyone. He is such a likable
  man (both in the film and in life) that you can't help but feel
  sorry for the mess he has created. His entire performance is a
  balancing act between getting away with a seemingly harmless
  crime, keeping his partners at bay and their mouths shut while
  being prodded along by his conspirator wife. That may make them
  all sound malicious, but really the opposite is actually true.
  They're all normal folks, like we've all seen a hundred times.
  And in the end it really gets to you because you can imagine how
  you would react in the same situations they find themselves in.
  After all, were you faced with the choice to steal a couple
  million dollars that no one would miss, what would you do? But
  then again, nothing is ever that simple</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">My brother is Cameron Fry and it wasn't
  until his first year in college that he found his Ferris Bueller.
  This is a classic that every high school student should see. It's
  a great way to appreciate life and the parade scene is one of the
  best. It's easy to tell from this film that Matthew Broderick was
  destined to be a star</Text>

  <Text category="dvd">The Firms "Super Body Sculpt" is a 40 mins,
  3 parts workout which is broken up into Upper Body, Lower Body,
  and Abs. Each segment has its own warmup and cool down. It can be
  performed one segment at a time, or all together for a complete
  total body workout. The Upper Body flies by quickly with pushups,
  lat rows and french presses and biceps. The Lower Body section
  focuses a little too much on Squats, and by the end of your last
  leg press exercise, there are more squats that will make you want
  to scream "Enough". I found the Abs section too short and not
  enough emphasis on crunches, and too much on obliques. The
  stablization exercises are a great bonus to this DVD, and are my
  favourite. Overall it is very well instructed. You can pyramid up
  the weights if you are strong enough, especcially during leg
  presses and squats. I usually do all three segments to get the
  full benefits I need, and this DVD is great as a beginners tool
  to a firm body</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">i just wanted to say this is a great
  workout. i love the eastern dance styles. i have just written a
  long review of honey's bollywood workout,and people were saying
  the same things, too fast etc...but indian dance is taught by
  imitation, and is very expressive facially and bodily(especially
  the classical dances) and open to improv. bollywood and bhangra
  are an extension of classical. most don't realize eastern dance
  is learned and practiced in a vigorous manner imitating,
  learning, and memorizing from the beginning. the teachers of the
  classical and indian dances do not like to break up the steps and
  movement or slow them unless they are so, because you lose the
  inspiration and the feeling of whatever you may be portraying. so
  have fun with this, it's awesome and leaves room for your own
  interpretation of things as mentioned. and it really wears you
  out. plus everyone looks great dancing and celebrating the
  movement and abilities of the body no matter the dance form! but
  i find eastern to be the most passionate, feminine, beautiful,
  and divine. have fun</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">Haven't we all been there? Wishing we could
  be better than someone else? Wishing that we had our turn in the
  spotlight? This is exactly how the movie "Cheaters" affected me.
  I found it truly amazing that this movie was made on a true story
  like this. The plot is really incredible and actually makes you
  ponder the question "What would I do in this situation?" Jeff
  Daniels and Jena Malone give such incredible performances in this
  movie. I believe that they are very convincing. If you are in the
  mood to be emotionally touched by a movie, "Cheaters" is the true
  direction for you to head in</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">This is my favorite toning workout and I'm
  sure to incorporate it into my routine for my once a week
  tone-fest. What I like best about it is that I can customize it
  to whatever body part I think needs the most work this week. Need
  a 30 minute ab workout? You can choose it. Think the arms and
  legs need work? No problem. Want to tone a little bit of
  everything? You can do that, too. The instructors are all good -
  clear, not irritating, and they come up with some unique
  exercises to work each body part - it's not your standard
  crunches for ab work on this video. This was one of my best
  purchases, workout-wise. I wish there were more DVD's/workouts
  out there with Minna Lessig - she is my favorite instructor (she
  does the arm/leg workouts on this DVD). The other two instructors
  are wonderful as well - and the workout just seems to fly by,
  although at the end you do know you've worked those muscle
  groups.</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">This was a great DVD I bought it for my
  husband and he loved it. There were a few episodes that we never
  saw and the outakes were really funny. I definately would
  recomend</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">Absolutely one of the best movies I have
  ever seen. I saw it first in 1995 on video, I believe. Never saw
  it or heard of it on the big screen. Anyway, it's proof positive
  that a great directorial job, with actors (human and animal) who
  believe in a story about real human failings, lightheartedness
  and heroics can turn a pretty good screenplay with wonderfully
  charming dogs into one with a real impact on your life. I had to
  see it again a couple of years later just to make sure it was as
  good as I thought. It deals with real suffering (including death,
  revenge, and anger) and then redemption. Don't look for the
  classic happy ending, but an ending which is consistent with the
  themes in the movie and is very satisfying, after a little
  thought. The movie completely pulls you in (without your
  realizing it) and works its magic on your mind. But, don't expect
  it to be powerful though you will notice tears forming frequently
  throughout the movie, often unexplained at first. "Fluke" also
  seemed to leave me a little wiser and more understanding and
  compassionate toward my family, especially. I sort of got it the
  next day! And, you will love "Fluke", the dog! The movie is about
  a dog, but it's really about so much more. Even though the dog
  scenes are great, the subject matter at times is rather charged
  and there is violence and death (human and animal), so please be
  prepared to talk about it with your kids if they watch it with
  you</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">I heard so much about Masaki Kobayashi's
  "Harakiri", so I bought it at Amazon and watched it. Wow, this
  movie is awesome!! Now I don't know who is my #1 favorite
  director, Akira Kurosawa or Masaki Kobayashi. This black and
  white movie intensifies the theme of this movie along with the
  music by Tohru Takemitsu. In addition to these assets, the camera
  is wonderful. I pick this movie as one of "my movies of my life".
  Tatuyua Nakadai was shining in this movie. I like him more after

  packaging it great and frankly 6 films from the great Robert
  Mitchum at under $10 each on DVD w/bonus features is a
  terrrrrifffic deal! The movies aren't generally considered

  Jean Simmons as a costar and Otto Preminger directing Angel Face,
  Josef Von Sternberg helming Macao, Vincent Minnelli directing
  HOme From The Hill, The great Fred Zinneman directing and the
  legend Deborah Kerr co-starring in the Sundowners ...you can

  <Text category="dvd">I like this movie a lot - not just because
  it is made by Visconti (one of the greatest cinematic figures of
  the 20th century) or because of its cast (Dirk Bogarde and Helmut
  Griem are always good) - no, I think it is the way the film
  attempts to look at a bigger picture through the corruption that
  surrounds a wealthy family that makes this film so interesting.
  You can see elements of this style in other Visconti films like
  the Leopard, in Coppola's Godfather trilogy, and in Fassbinder's
  Maria Braun. Now to speak of Visconti's visual genius - Has there
  ever been a director who could sustain a scene in such a
  virtuosic way as in the nazi 'party' scene midway through the
  film - Or again in 'Death in Venice' - with the scenes on the
  beach. Anyway enough of my babble - just see the films of
  Visconti - and you will see what I mean</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">I saw this back in 1985 when if first came

  been, though. Mr. Wood is a very charismatic presenter. But is
  what's better is that he took the story of the story of the
  Trojan War from the pages of modern myth to reality. I have read
  Homer and I knew about Schlieman, but other than that, I was
  ignorant of the Trojan War. Mr. Wood started with what a regular
  person knew about the war and then took it into deeper level. I
  was fascinated by the connection he made to the Hittite Empire.
  The thought had never occurred to me that if a Troy did exist, it
  might have trade relations with empires to the east. He also
  included experts in the fields of archeology, modern history and
  history of the period. I thouroughly enjoyed the dvd and have
  seen it several times. I also have the Alexander dvd and
  Shakepeare. "In Search of Shakespeare", was fun. Wood took the
  story of Shakespeare down to the center of his human story. I
  would recommend all the Wood "In Search of..." programs. If you
  can't find the films, then read the books. The books are just are
  entertaining.</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">By winning their third title in four years
  the same year that the baseball team that defines the hopes and
  dreams of generations of New Englanders wins its first World
  Series in 86 years. It's true, the Patriots somehow pieced
  together a team that, despite a string of injuries that seemed to
  defy all rationality and managed to finish a second consecutive
  campaign as Super Bowl champions with a 17-2 record (which just
  as easily could have/should have been 18-1)...but the 2004 Boston
  Red Sox completely sucked the oxygen out of the American Sports
  atmosphere and somehow the 2004 Patriots season just doesn't seem
  to measure up to the previous title years of 2001 and 2003. Part
  of the reason is that the previous years seemed to have their own
  personalities (2001 having 9/11, the coming-of-age of Tom Brady,
  the Snow Bowl, and the unbelievable finish of what was probably
  the most exciting Super Bowl ever. 2003 had the release of Lawyer
  Milloy, the early stumbles to Buffalo and Washington, the birth
  of the winning streak, winter weather in Foxboro, and yet another
  thrilling Super Bowl finish); 2004 just seemed like an anticlimax
  by comparison, like you were watching a scripted performance that
  was always going to end with the "W" on the Patriots' side of the
  field. This is not to say that there were not intriguing
  challenges that made for good storytelling...the injuries
  (leading to the incredible "throwback" two-way play of veteran
  Wide Receiver/rookie Cornerback Troy Brown), the continued
  winning streak, the rebirth of offseason acquisition Corey
  Dillon, the continuing mastery of the Indianapolis Colts, and the
  return to Pittsburgh (where the record 21-game winning streak
  came to an emphatic end on Halloween (just days after the Red Sox
  won the World Series, karmically enough), where University of
  Michigan graduate Tom Brady resurrected himself from a
  triple-digit fever the night before to thoroughly dismantle the
  best regarded defense in the NFL to send the Patriots back to the
  Super Bowl, this time in the unfairly maligned city of
  Jacksonville, FL. No nail-biting endings this time,
  though...despite the best efforts of Terrell Owens to come back
  from a leg and ankle injury that would have ended the season of
  anyone else (with the possible exception of Curt Schilling, of
  course), the Eagles All-Pro was clearly the second-best receiver
  on the field as Deion Branch won the Super Bowl MVP for a record
  day (Safetyman and Render Of Mayhem Extraordinaire Rodney
  Harrison would have been my pick, actually) and the Patriots,
  though trailing early, never really seemed in doubt of winning a
  game they led by 10 points late before prevailing by the final
  score of 24-21 which in truth flattered the Eagles more than they
  deserved. Far be it that a season ending with a record of 17-2
  and another Super Bowl ring should be considered hum-drum, but
  there was something missing from the 2004 campaign that,
  impressive as it was, just doesn't translate to the memorable
  re-telling that the Pats' previous title years do. This is a
  great DVD for Pats fans, indispensible even, but for the casual
  fan who appreciates the drama that a good NFL season can bring, I
  would recommend either of the previous Patriots highlights DVD's
  over this one</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">Ohm... Ohm... Ohm... Back in 2000, Ellipsis
  Arts released OHM: The Early Gurus of Electronic Music, a
  fantastic and essential three CD set tracing the evolution of
  "electronica" from Messiaen, Cage, and Xenakis to Schulze, Eno,
  and Hassell. This set was recently reissued (as OHM+) along with
  a bonus DVD, which is thankfully now available separately for
  those of us who already have the CDs. The OHM+ DVD is jam-packed
  with over two hours of archival and more recent footage that runs
  the gamut from engrossing to mildly interesting to unwatchably
  dull. If seemingly endless "talking head" interviews with Milton
  Babbitt and Bebe Barron are your idea of video entertainment,
  you've come to the right place. An interview with John Cage
  digitally altered beyond all recognition? Check. Swirling
  psychadelic colored dyes right out of a Saucerful of Secrets-era
  Pink Floyd concert? No problem. There are some tastier goodies to
  be found on this DVD, however... The segments with Clara Rockmore
  and Leon Theremin have an appealingly amateurish home movie
  quality to them. It's also a real treat to see the 1978 footage
  of underappreciated minimalist guru David Borden and Mother
  Mallard's Portable Masterpiece Company "on the road" hauling
  around their truckload of big old analog synthesizer equipment.
  Laurie Spiegel is fun to watch as she tinkers with a big grey
  metal box called a "Concerto Generator" with an extremely serious
  expression on her face. And Alvin Lucier's "Music for Solo
  Performer," where he hooks up wires to his head and produces
  sounds using his brainwaves and two tympani, simply must be seen
  to be believed. The Pixar-ish computer animation accompanying
  Paul Lansky's "The Dust Bunny" is sort of cute, but it goes on
  for about 10 minutes too long. Surely most of the OHM target
  audience already has the DVD of Steve Reich's Three Tales, but
  it's nice that they included the best part - the ominous yet
  goofy "Dolly" segment. Many have also probably seen Hans
  Fjellestad's documentary Moog before, but the six minute excerpt
  provided here is really about all you need. It's too bad there
  isn't a more interesting John Cage segment, and regrettable that
  there aren't any Stockhausen videos (those would certainly be a
  riot!) Overall, though, while the OHM+ DVD is not as consistently
  engaging as the CD set of the same name, it is a worthy companion
  to it. And if you don't have either of them yet, the complete
  OHM+ 3-CD &amp;amp; DVD "special edition" box set is a
  no-brainer</Text>

  <Text category="dvd">Crackerjack courtroom trial drama based on a
  true story of three Australian soldiers in the Boer War accused
  of killing prisoners and a Dutch minister. The British command is
  obviously using the three as scapegoats to convince the Germans,
  who seem eager to join the war on the side of the Boers, to stay
  out. The men claim they were only following orders, orders which
  went against "normal" military practice. This is a new type of
  warfare: the Boers fought as guerrillas, not in uniform, not by
  "the rules." The Australians on trial felt they were engaging
  them on those terms. The morality of war itself, therefore, is
  just as much on trial as these men. They all lose in the end. The
  trial scenes are well paced, and the use of flashback creates
  just the right amount of tension. Also there are enough shady
  gray areas to keep the proceedings interesting. Well worth a
  watch</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">Supposed being victimized by local communist

  changed countries and jobs like surgical gloves he did at

  to a beautiful adorable woman stopped a character with Southern
  European rather than Slavic appearance a little. Extended up to
  165 minutes of screening, romantic tale with some near-porno
  inclusions is a bit more over-positive and over-entertaining than
  its final collapsed in. Well, movie spirit seems being similar to
  "A Beautiful Life", "Producers" or, more recent one of Levi's

  saw this movie in 3D, sigh I can die happy! Ok this one is really
  pretty awesome. Chris plays a great leading girl (the only F-13
  leadI didnt want to see with an axe in her skull). The other
  characters are pretty harmless too. Wev'e got bikers (snort),
  pothead hippies, a fro'd chubster and a dude who can walks on his
  hands better than he can act. Plus this came out in the early
  80's so the ratings board didnt demolish all the awesome gore
  scenes. I give this one a high-5! Cool deaths, funny scenes and
  aside from Chris's sherbert pants, some decent 80's fashion too.

  <Text category="dvd">Expect a liberal dose of everything you
  generally do from a martial arts flick -- slapstick comedy,
  overly melodramatic subplotting, and, on occasion, even a hint of
  a story. All that aside (which is how I am sure the director saw
  it) the balletic, intricate and often incredible stunt work
  during the action scenes is an absolute treat. Jet Li's utter
  disregard for human limits is evident as he turns in a
  surprisingly measured yet kinetic performance, nothing like his
  forgettable Hollywood yawns. The subtitles for this
  Mandarin-language effort are a bit difficult to read, since the
  English is in small print below the more prominent Chinese
  subtitles. But when the action kicks into gear, forget them and
  just watch the graceful choreography of the fight scenes. Notably
  notable in the three installments: PART-I: A mind-blowing
  hook-and-ladder battle, plus a terrific umbrella sequence.
  PART-II: The climactic fight with Donnie Yen. The speed and
  technique shown during the double-pole fight is staggering; Yen's
  moves with his cloth staff left me gob-smacked. PART-III: This
  one clearly suffers and is even borderline skippable. The final
  fight scene at the lion-dance competition is a colorful pageant,
  but lacks the impact of the one-on-one fights in the first two
  films, mainly because the participants are all wearing giant lion
  head masks. All in all, can't go Wong with this purchase.</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">Okay, after reading several reviews, I
  decided to buy this anyway for a few laughs. Boy did I get my
  moneys worth! It was so incredibly BAD that I was first cringing
  in horror before I started laughing. The characters, especially
  Hiei, were so screwed up and the voice dubbing was so unfamiliar
  that in the end it had me laughing. Now, I'm a die hard yyh fan,
  but I give it high marks just because it was so much fun to
  watch. Put me in a good mood for the rest of the day. If you
  arent pressed for cash and up for a few laughs i'd definitely

  <Text category="dvd">This review refers to "Excalibur"(DVD-Region
  2) In days of old, with knights so bold, and fair maidens
  glittering all in gold, lays the legend of King Arthur, Camelot,
  and the powerful, mystical sword known as "Excalibur". John
  Boorman's beautiful artistic film (adopted from Sir Arthur
  Mallory's "Le Morte D'Arthur"),will captivate you and take you
  away to another time and place. From the birth of Arthur, Merlin
  taking him away for 20 years, Arthur drawing "Excalibur" from the
  stone, the emergence of Camelot,the magical powers of Merlin and
  the evil Morgana, to Arthur's demise and being taken off to
  Avalon, the beauty of this film and this story will have you
  under a spell. The European cast and the exquisite location
  shoots in the country side of Ireland add a sense of authenticity
  to the flavor of this film. King Arthur, The Knights of the Round
  Table,Sir Lancelot, Guinevere, Merlin, Morgana, Sir Gawain,
  Percival, Uther, they're all very much part of the story, and the
  cast is tremendous. Nigel Terry is the good and noble King
  Arthur, Lancelot and Guinevere, who loved their King but also
  each other are played by Nicholas Clay and Cherie Lunghi. You'll
  see stellar performances by a young Gabriel Bryne(in his first
  feature film), Patrick Stewart, and Liam Neeson. Helen Mirren is
  excellent as the evil Morgana, and the always wonderful Nicol
  Williamson is the magical mystical Merlin This edition is for
  viewers with DVD players compatible with Region 2(Japan, Europe,
  South Africa, and the Middle East, including Egypt ).Some players
  are multi-regional, so check your manual. Parents...although a
  wonderful tale of knights and fair ladies, this is NOT one for
  younger viewers. The battle scenes are violent and a bit graphic
  and there are also some sexual situations. "First Knight" with
  Richard Gere and Sean Connery, although not quite as true to the
  legend, is rated PG-13, is quite an entertaining film, and may be
  more suitable for family viewing(there is some violence). A
  beautiful story and film. Enjoy....Lauri</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">This film is a must-see for any dancer. The
  clips used to showcase different types of dancing in film are
  creatively woven together and the commentary is very informative.
  Many famous scenes from the old MGM musicals to the water spray
  scene in Flashdance are used to illustrate how diversified
  dancing in films can be. For ballet dancers, there is a portion
  devoted solely to ballet in films which is hosted by Mikhail
  Baryshnikov. Scenes of Rudolph Nureyev leaping through the air
  compliment this section as well as scenes from various ballets.
  Liza Minelli hosts the Broadway inspirational portion which is
  shorter in length. I only saw this film once but I feel that it
  is a must-own selection for any dancer</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">This workout is nice because it doesn't mess
  around. There are no long introductions you can't fast-forward
  through and the workout itself is challenging both the abdominal
  and breath series and the side series (which is all legs and
  hips) are really challenging and I plan on doing them to keep my
  muscles toned even after delivery. One complaint is that
  apparently she releases the videos herself and they aren't
  available very widespread in retail stores. I also would have
  liked it if they had included more arm work or a postnatal
  workout. All in all though great</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">My first viewing of this film was a great
  disappointment. I expected another Jeanette MacDonald and Nelson
  Eddy film, with Chevalier substituting for Eddy. And I
  emphatically did not like the film. Then I viewed the film a
  second time, this time with the play-by-play voice-over analysis
  by Miles Kreuger, which comes as a extra bonus on this DVD.
  Suddenly I was seeing the film in a completely different light,
  and absolutely loving this film. This DVD is an absolute gem, and
  one of the best things about it is the intelligent and articulate
  insights provided by Miles Kreuger, not confined to this film
  alone but applying to the cinema world at large in the early 30s.
  It is as if a film critic from the 1930s had come back to life,
  as if he had actually been on the sets during the filming
  (because he's talked to those who were). Kreuger's commentary
  alone is worth the price of this DVD. After seeing this film for
  the first time, you must go back and see it again through Miles
  Kreuger's eyes.</Text>

  <Text category="dvd">You can tell your life is REALLY pathetic
  when ghosts have to show you how to live. But that is what
  happens to Cosmo Topper, in the charming "Topper" and its equally
  charming sequel "Topper Returns." It's basically your typical
  screwball comedy (complete with Cary Grant), but with an
  injection of supernatural pranking and murder mystery. In other
  words, it's loads of fun. George and Marion Kirby (Cary Grant,
  Constance Bennett) love fun, partying until clubs kick them out,
  and generally not taking life seriously. So it's a shock to them
  when they die in a car accident, and linger on as ghosts.
  Apparently they have not done any good deeds to go to the Great
  Beyond. So when George's boss, Cosmo Topper (Roland Young),
  crashes his new car in the same spot, the Kirbys take him under
  their wing. Poor Cosmo is stodgy and timid, with a domineering
  wife who schedules his day down to the minute. So it's up to the
  Kirbys to show the poor man how to live life and have fun, but
  their good deed rapidly gets away from them... And most sequels
  stink, but goofy murder mystery "Topper Returns" is just as funny
  as the first movie. Instead of a ghostly screwball, this time
  it's a spoof of "haunted house" stories, with a nod to
  Hitchcock's "Rebecca." Ann Carrington (Carole Landis) is
  returning to her ancestral home and inheritance, with cheeky pal
  Gail (Joan Blondell) in tow. But after the girls switch bedrooms,
  someone murders Gail. Confused, she drifts over to the house of
  Cosmo Topper (Roland Young), whose car she hijacked earlier in
  the day. Gail blackmails Topper into helping her discover who
  murdered her, and who is trying to kill Ann. Now the unfortunate
  Topper must somehow solve the mystery, despite a small army of
  creepy servants, a house full of secret passages and vicious
  seals, and his upset wife searching high and low for him... Based
  on Thorne Smith's novels, "Topper" and "Topper Returns" even had
  a spinoff TV series, which was nowhere near as good as the
  movies. And those movies are charming and still fresh, especially
  if you like to see a twist on the usual ghost stories. But it's
  the little touches that make this movie hilarious; for example,
  there's George laughing on a chandelier, and Gail chugging
  champagne when she discovers her own dead body. Not to mention
  that vicious seal. The comedy becomes more obvious and spoofy in
  the second film, but no less entertaining. But at the same time,
  these movies are graced by tender moments between George and
  Marion, and a truly exquisite scene where Gail's ghost wanders
  out the window into the sky. And I'm still not sure how that
  invisible-person-under-the-covers shot was done, especially with
  the primitive special effects of the 1940s. Roland Young is the
  star of the piece -- his Topper is timid, halting, and has his
  day scheduled down to the minute. Not a single spark of
  sponteneity. Grant comes across like a trickster god, and has
  wonderful chemistry with Bennett. And Blondell is simply charming
  as a resourcefully cheeky ghost girl. "Topper" and "Topper
  Returns" are decades old, but are perfect examples of Hollywood
  classics. Charming, chipper and hilarious</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">I do not consider it hyperbole to talk about
  the second season of "Buffy the Vampire Slayer" as scaling
  operatic heights, culminating with the glorious aria of
  "Becoming, Part 2," which I still relentlesly tout as one of the
  ten best dramatic hours on television I have ever seen in my
  life. I have watched a lot of television and have been teaching
  classes about this topic for over half my life, so I believe I
  can make a pretty convincing case. We witnesses the potential of
  this series in Season 1, when creator Joss Whedon held off on the
  revelation that the mysterious Angel was really a vampire, who
  just happened to have a soul and loved the Slayer, until half way
  through the abbreviated first season. In Season 2, we find out
  just how far true love can go wrong. Love continues to be a very
  painful thing for the Scooby Gang, as Cordelia ("Some Assembly
  Required"), Xander ("Inca Mummy Girl") and Joyce ("Ted"), find
  out. Then again, prospects look much better for Willow
  ("Phases"), although we never really do take the Cordelia-Xander
  romance ("Go Fish") to be anything more than a cosmic joke, which
  does offer up the delightfully twisted "Bewitched, Bothered, and
  Bewildered" as the exception that proves the rule (footnote:
  Buffy spends most of the episode as the Buffy rat because Sarah
  Michelle Gellar was hosting SNL that week). Of the off-arc
  stories, "Halloween" and "Ted" are clearly the best of the bunch.
  But when it comes to romance, Buffy and Angel are truly on the
  road to hell paved with the best of intentions. It is clear in
  the season premier episode, "When She Was Bad," that things are
  different. When Buffy dances seductively with Xander, taunting
  him with her sexuality, the ante has been upped considerably. The
  pivotal point in the season comes with episode 13 (of 22),
  "Surprise," when Buffy unknowingly undoes Angel's curse on the
  night of her 17th birthday by making love to him. Why the gypsies
  put in the Faustian (in the Goethe sense) escape clause via the
  moment of true happiness and contentment is debatable, but the
  galvanizing effect on the show is truly impressive. When Angelus
  brutally slays Jenny Calendar in "Passion," leaving her body in a
  grotesque display for Giles to discover in his bed (while opera
  music soars in the background), it is the symbolic Hellmouth of
  the show opening up. The audience is shocked into realizing how
  bad things can get, only the worst is yet to come. Giles's anger
  buys him one shot at Angelus, but Buffy has to rescue him. They
  turn on each other in anger, and Buffy actually slugs him to the
  ground before they collapse weeping in each other's arms. Buffy
  tells him, "I can't do this alone," but this proves to be most
  ironically incorrect. Clearly Whedon constructs each season
  around two half-season story arcs. The first half of Season 2
  heralds the arrival of Spike and Dru, and the quick departure of
  "The Annoying One." Of course now we look back and are amazed at
  what James Marsters has done with the role of Spike, but at this
  point it is Juliet Landau's ditzy psychotic vampire who provides
  the flair of the dark side. Whedon brings the first half to a
  climax in "What's My Line?," the show's first two-parter, where
  we are introduced to Kendra the Vampire Slayer. It seems Buffy's
  brief moment of death at the hands of the Master in "Prophecy
  Girl" has some long reaching implications we only begin to
  appreciate at this point. But with the return of Angelus
  everything changes. Spike and Drusilla are trying to reassemble
  the Judge, a grotesque who cannot be killed "by any weapon
  forged." Then everybody learns the truth about not only Angel's
  transformation but also Jenny's betrayal. Thus begins the deadly
  game of cat and mouse between Angel and his former allies, which
  culminates in the two parts of "Becoming." Both parts of
  "Becoming" are written and directed by Whedon, and represent the
  apex of his work on the series. When Angeleus opens the portal to
  Hell, only his blood can close it, but things are not going to be
  that easy for Buffy. The dramatic culmination contains the best
  fight sequence (with swords) in a show that prides itself on
  innovative staging of its fights, and is an ultimately
  emotionally shattering experience captured beautifully by Sarah
  Michelle Gellar's slow dissolve into tears while the haunting
  Sarah McLachlan song "Full of Grace" is played. Joss Whedon had
  set this moment up from the first episode of the series. It is a
  payoff usually reserved for the final episode of a series and not
  simply the end of the second season. "Becoming" is truly an
  astounding accomplishment in the history of dramatic television
  and when you watch the entire second season again you can
  appreciate how brilliantly this shattering conclusion is set up.
  The original theatrical film was a teaser, the first season on
  television was an appetizer, but the second season of "Buffy the
  Vampire Slayer" was epic and once you see this, whether again or
  for the first time, you are not going to want to stop here. It
  was also nice to see that the extras went up a couple of notches
  for the Season 2 DVD collection, especially since we expect more
  goodies from Whedon and crew, especially given the high quality
  of "The Watchers Guide," the show's official companion volumes.
  There was a lot of thought put into this show, which means any
  and all insights and looks behind the curtain are greatly
  appreciated</Text>

  whatever. Pete says things about him in a couple of places
  (online) and all i could think is "who is that?" so thats also

  between. Some great bit characters make up a fun ensemble. The
  cast is pretty damn cool, with Urich being upstaged by Ron
  Pearlman, Angellica Houston, John Mat.. Mattus... The big guy.
  Anyway, it's cornball comedy with a basic plot. Hey what do you
  want? It's 80's chessy goodness and more fun that it should have

  Dostoevsky's central character a new breath of life from the
  modern day perspective. The movie attempts to survey the
  convoluted mind of a building inspector through a video-taped
  self confession. The psychological similarities between the
  character in Dostoevsky's novel and the building supervisor in
  the movie are uncanny. Both characters share a state of mind that
  is the epitome of a human condition where miserable anti hero
  attitude reigns through a heightened level consciousness and the
  rationality of everyday living through action is put to rest. The
  character in the movie who identifies himself as a "sick man, a
  spiteful man" lives his life in isolation by the drowning himself
  into the puddle of his own conflicting thoughts. He despises his
  friends and at the same time he seems eager to improve his
  relationship with them. The character in the movie voluntarily
  creates unpleasant scenarios that trigger his eventual self
  demise. He often finds himself confined within the conflicting
  walls of his consciousness. He falls in love with a prostitute
  but at the same time he is utterly disgusted by her profession
  and tries to dominate her. By escalating the level of his thought
  process well above the habitual human awareness, the central
  character of the movie isolates himself from the crowd that
  Dostoevsky's narrator identifies as the "Men of Action". The
  building supervisor is paralyzed by the own consciousness just
  like the narrator in Dostoevsky's novel. Dostoevsky's novel and
  the movie helps us realize that the collective standard of
  self-consciousness that the society forces us to adapt through a
  methodical process of uniformity and conformity, has a negative
  side effect that is strong enough to paralyze our lives and
  inflict a profound sense of alienation in our minds.</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">I saw the original about 4-5 times from
  1970-1971.. This one is not much different, just modestly.. I had
  been attempting to purchase this flick for 30 years, but was
  unable because the Studio (Warner Bros.) refused to release it
  under any format.. I was thrilled that it was finally released,
  and have since been watching it with many friends.. Most had no
  idea this movie was ever out.. I was particularly interested in
  Anita Palenburg, she has really changed over the last 38 years..
  The content may be a bit provacative for most (Sex and Violence)
  but the quality are extraodinary for that era.. This one is a
  must for anyone.</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">This film had a powerful effect on me. 95%
  of the people I know don't read books. I met a millionaire not
  long ago, who boasted to me that he had never read a book in his
  life. Lady Di was reported never to have read anything --- except
  perhaps fashion mags. My children hardly read, and their husbands
  and wives certainly don't. My ex-wife never read anything. Her
  father thought Ulysses was a dirty book. I stopped watching
  television in 1980, and I own 10,000 books --- but not Fahrenheit
  451, which I'd read about 45 years ago. This was long enough for
  me not to compare the film with Bradbury's text, but the message
  came through the movie medium loud and clear, and with a very
  solid punch to the plexus. The manner in which it is written,
  played and directed, added to its impact. This world of
  sleep-walkers perfectly matched what is already all around us.
  The style was strange, but gradually you realise that this
  strangeness is actually what is now completely normal. People
  live and work like automated morons. They can't think for
  themselves, and their critical faculties are almost totally
  atrophied. They can't conduct a stimulating conversation of any
  kind: in fact, present them with an idea, or attempt to initiate
  a discussion, and they'll often become angry. Some of the several
  low end reviews on this site illustrate precisely what the film
  depicts. Ludicrous suggestions: remake it with mad Mel Gibson.
  Have infantile Spielberg direct it. Bulk it out with computerised
  SFX. These ghastly proposals precisely reflect the mentality of
  the sub-humans which the film targets, and many of them seem
  unable to understand their own language, let alone write it, or
  spell it. This is a memorable film, for those whose memories
  still function. Unlike the Captain of the firemen</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">In an attempt to meet more girls, I took
  French many, many years ago when I was still in junior high
  school (middle school to you young 'uns). In class, my French
  teacher treated us to a film screening of Jean Cocteau's LA BELLE
  ET LA BETE (BEAUTY AND THE BEAST). Truthfully, back then, I
  didn't think much of it other than being something too "arty."
  But, over the past two decades, I've seen this film a number of
  times and now have a decidedly higher opinion of it. LA BELLE ET
  LA BETE is a seriously important movie and a groundbreaking entry
  into the world of cinema. It's certainly Cocteau's masterpiece.
  Without a doubt, it provided the direct inspiration for Disney's
  Oscar-nominated version, as well as greatly influencing CBS's
  1987 BEAUTY AND THE BEAST television series. Jean Cocteau took
  Madame Leprince de Beaumont's classic story, adapted it, and put
  his own stamp on it. Cocteau's artistic vision is dazzling to
  behold. The viewer is treated to a delectable visual feast
  replete with disturbingly aware statues, ghostly arms jutting out
  of walls to clutch candles, vocal household objects, jewelry
  which turns to rubbish, etc. But nicely juxtaposed with the
  imaginative, surrealistic trappings are the more mundane
  sequences revolving around Belle's family, which serve to
  somewhat ground the fairy tale to a more reality-based semblance.
  This atmospheric film was given an enormous lift by the very
  wonderful performances of the two leads, Josette Day and Jean
  Marais. Josette Day, as Belle, her most luminous role,
  personified beauty, grace, and class. Jean Marais, on the other
  hand, made women and young girls swoon in his dual roles as the
  handsome scoundrel Avenant and the tortured but gentle-hearted
  Beast. In fact, Marais portrayed the fearsome Beast in such a
  sympathetic and romantic light that, in the end, when the hirsute
  and awful monster was transformed into the handsome prince,
  Cocteau and Marais actually received many letters of complaint.
  The women much preferred their kindly Beast.

  <Text category="dvd">"Domestic Disturbance" is a thriller about a
  divorced couple and their child. Frank (John Travolta) has to
  deal with a man marrying his ex-wife Susan. The guy (Vince
  Vaughn) is well liked by the community, but there are hints of
  something being amiss with him. Frank's son claims he witnesses
  his mother's new husband Rick commit murder. The more Frank
  investigates Rick, the more suspicious he looks. The
  investigation spurs a game of cat and mouse. There is great
  interaction between Travolta as a concerned parent and Vaughn the
  cold heartless type. The tension between them breeds suspense.
  The would-be new father uses his craftiness to manipulate those
  around him. There are few things he wouldn't do to get his way.
  "Domestic Disturbance" is entertaining with its high-tension
  suspense and great action. I highly recommend it for those who
  enjoy a thriller that will keep you guessing to the last
  minutes.</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">Based on Bizet's tragic Spanish opera, this
  was Rita Hayworth's first film made by her production company,
  Beckworth (derived from her screen surname and from the name of
  her daughter, Rebecca). She decided on her close friend and
  favorite leading man, Glenn Ford, as Don Jose to her Carmen. The
  results are far better than some reviews would have you believe.
  The glorious, lush Techincolor is fabulous (studio-bound as most
  of the sets may be), while Hayworth's unforgettable screen
  presence, dancing and bewitching beauty, and the heat generated
  between her and Ford makes this movie memorable. The sequence in
  which she describes what virtues a lover should have (complete
  with putting her finger to his lips) sparkles with sensual
  static. Granted, Ford looks stiff and ill at ease in his uniform
  (after he sheds his soldier garb and dons his "bandit clothing",
  he appears much more relaxed). If it is deemed worthy enough to
  be released as part of the Columbia Classics collection, so
  should "Affair In Trinidad", another Hayworth/Ford collaboration.
  It's just great to look at, flaws aside. If you adore Rita and
  Glenn, even in a tempestuous, volatile romance, this movie will
  provide that for you. Was there ever a more enticing, tempestous
  gypsy with so many men in her life but only one true and
  ultimately tragic love?</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">A film that centers on four friends who made
  a pact to leave their small town arrive at zero hour and must
  decide if they will go through with it. The story is simple
  enough, and not a whole lot happens. But there's no denying it,
  this movie is enjoyable and aesthetically pleasing in every way.
  It's a treat to see an intelligent movie where the main
  charachters are teenagers, and that the film doesn't have to
  resort too fart jokes for an audience. Not one charachter is
  stereotyped. They are human, and they'll probably remind you of
  people you know. I applaud this kind of a movie, and I wish there
  would be more of them</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">Daniel Deronda is George Eliot's 1876 novel
  dealing with the rise of Zionism incarnated in young Daniel
  Deronda. Sadly but truly this is the first major English novel
  giving a positive view of the Jewish people. Deronda is raised by
  the wealthy Sir Malinger as an English gentleman. In the course
  of the long novel and miniseries he learns he is a Jew; meets his
  mother and is the love object of two fascinating women. Mirah
  Lapidoth is the Jewish musician who is rescued from suicide by
  Daniel. Her love for Daniel burgeons as she comes to know and
  love the kind young man. Gwendolyn Harleth played by the
  brilliant acting of Romola Garai is the spoiled,impecunious
  husband hunter who weds the rich cad Grandcourt only to rue her
  unwise choice of mates! She loves Deronda as her marriage becomes
  a torture chamber of psychological combat. Like all BBC
  productions this one is photographed in beautifully rich colors.
  The scenery is beautiful and the musical score is haunting to the
  ear. This tale runs about four hours and is a joy.Many American
  viewers may be dismayed at the slow, leisurely pace of British
  productions. Please remember that these productions are based on
  long English novels which were published in several monthly
  parts. They are long but they are also wonderful explorations of
  the human soul. Gwendolyn's story is a bildungsroman in which she
  grows as a person. Ditto for Deronda who learns to take pride in
  his Hebrew heritage. This is a worthy BBC production well worth
  the viewer's time and money</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">While this DVD was obviously filmed in the
  early 1970s with the picture quality to match at times, the
  genius of David Bowie shines through. As adults too young to

  the time period. The sound quality is suprisingly good, although
  some camera angles are distracting at times. It was also neat to
  hear Bowie's pronouncement of "This is our last tour ever."

  <Text category="dvd">Some of the other reviews have said that the
  film is not editted properly and 'too slow'. I'm not a film-maker
  and cannot comment on that other than to say that they are wrong.
  The film is amazing. I'm not sure if there is ANY other movie or
  documentary that shows what a
  serialkiller-cum-dictator-cum-statesman is like. Nowadays people
  might not know who Idi Amin is, or what he did, so its important
  to read up a little so you can truely appreciate this movie. He
  plays accordian? You see him meeting with his 'advisors' (some of
  whom disappear so after.) You see him play acting like a grown-up
  boy with toy soldiers. You see his self-appointed royal pedigree
  and send his support for Nixon! Its fascinating and amazing. This
  is man that, self-proclaimed, actually ATE some of his rivals
  (not the whole body I hope). He killed many people directly and
  by his policies. His ego is outstanding and its an amazing movie.
  Apparently, there is a new movies coming out about Idi Amin
  starring Forrest Whitaker. He's a good actor and so I look
  forward to seeing it. But this is the REAL guy. Its amazing and a
  feat probably never to happen again</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">I don't often watch foreign films. The
  reason being, as an American, I don't feel that I can ever fully
  grasp the cultural and linguistic subtleties needed to truly
  understand and enjoy these works. French.... Spanish....
  German... etc.... regardless of nationality, genre, or time
  period, they generally leave me cold. With that in mind, I went
  into this with no doubts as to the film's greatness, but again,
  didn't think as an American I would be able to see it, as the
  situational nuances would be lost on me. As it turned out, I was
  wrong, and found a sublime masterpiece that went down easily, and
  didn't seem obtuse or "foreign". The experience could best be
  likened to watching "The Graduate", as you find yourself viewing
  seemingly mundane events and conversations, but the subtle turns
  in those events and words speak of such depth and gravity that
  you feel almost driven to your knees by the masterwork that you
  are watching. I won't recap the storyline, or discuss details of
  the movie itself, I just wanted to say that I went into this
  skeptical, expecting to find a picture that I couldn't relate to,
  but what I found was an immediate, compelling and moving work
  that speaks volumes of the human condition.</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">This is an awesome movie! I think its better
  than Anchors Aweigh. Gene Kelly and Frank Sinatra are two
  baseball players named Eddie O'Brien and Dennis Ryan who play for
  the Wolves. During the off-season Eddie and Dennis are vaudeville
  stars. When they return for the baseball season the whole team is
  horrifed to hear that the new owner K.C. Higgins wants to take an
  active part in coaching. As it turns out the K in K.C. Higgins
  happens to stand for Katherine (Esther Williams) so the new owner
  is a woman. Katherine dosn't fall for womanizer Eddie so the two
  don't get along at all!! Dennis does fall for her though, but
  Katherine isn't in love with him. Shirley Delwyn (Betty Garrett)
  has her eyes on Dennis and she won't give up on him! Also in the
  cast is Jules Munshin who plays Nat Goldberg, Dennis and Eddie's
  baseball pal. This movie has a lot of great music. The songs
  include "Take Me Out to the Ball Game" Frank and Gene sing this
  song as their vaudeville act. Also Williams sings this while
  swimming in the pool. "Yes, Indeedy" The boys sing this song to
  the baseball team when they return from their vaudeville act. Its
  about their love life. "O'Brien to Ryan to Goldberg" Kelly,
  Sinatra, and Munshin sing this song! One of the best numbers!
  "The Right Girl for Me" Sinatra sings this song to Williams.
  "It's Fate, Baby" Garrett sings this to Sinatra to prove that
  they were meant for each other. "Strictly USA" Probabley the best
  number everyone sings this at a party. "Upon St. Patrick's Day"
  Kelly dances and sings to this great song. He sorta does this
  Irish gig. Kelly is truly the best dancer there ever was! This is
  one of the best numbers up there w/ Strictly USA. At the end
  Kelly, Sinatra, Williams, Garrett sing to Strictly USA as the
  finale. It really great! The dvd has the following special
  features which are 2 deleted numbers called "Baby Face" and "Boys
  and Girls Like You and Me". It also contains the trailers of
  Anchors Aweigh, On the Town, and the trailer for this movie. Also
  includes notes on Frank Sinatra and Gene Kelly. For some odd
  reason I love this movie! This is a must see if you are a Kelly
  fan</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">I enjoyed Francis Veber's 'The Closet' -
  released in France in 2001 - for two reasons. First, it features
  an all-star ensemble of French acting, certainly a tribute to
  Veber's skill as a director. Just take a gander at the first six
  names to appear on the IMDB credits: Daniel Auteuil ....
  Fran&#239;&#191;&#189;ois Pignon G&#239;&#191;&#189;rard
  Depardieu .... F&#239;&#191;&#189;lix Santini Thierry Lhermitte
  .... Guillaume Mich&#239;&#191;&#189;le Laroque .... Mlle
  Bertrand Michel Aumont .... Belone, the neighbour Jean Rochefort
  .... Kopel, the director Imagine a movie where the great Jean
  Rochefort gets slotted sixth. Each of these six stars can carry a
  movie in France on their own back. The fact that the group has
  teamed here is a testament to Veber's reputation. His previous
  release, 1998's 'The Dinner Game,' was lauded far and wide as a
  comedic masterpiece. Actors get attracted to that type of skill.
  The second reason I got a kick out of watching 'The Closet': I
  just learned that 'Bend It Like Beckham' writing partners
  Gurinder Chadha and Paul Mayeda Berges are prepping a UK re-make
  for the screen for a targeted 2006 release, with Chadha at the
  helm. Her keen eye for comedy tinged with poignancy was confirmed
  by Beckham's runaway success, so I feel like I'm in on a really
  great secret knowing she's working on a re-make.</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">Overall, this is an extremely awesome
  concert. I am a big fan of DT, and like pretty much all their
  stuff. The performance itself is pretty good, although the only
  truly special thing they do is the instrumedley and Jordan's
  keyboard solo. Other than that they pretty much just play their
  songs as you hear them on the album. If they had done more
  special things, it would have gotten a 5 star rating instead of
  4. Other people complain about how the band really doesnt get
  into their music during the performance, but would say they did
  okay as far as that goes. Sure the singer doesnt get out from
  behind the mic stand, thats because half the time he is dragging
  it along with him, although i will say the band overall doesnt
  really get into it as much as most other metal bands, and thats
  probably why they have the video show up on the screens behind
  them. The special features are also pretty good, but i would not
  buy this concert just for those, backstage footage and things of
  that nature are cool but do not make a dvd good by themselves.
  Overall, i did think it was pretty cool, and i would recommend
  buying it if you like Dream Theater or just their genre of music
  in general</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">Plot Summary: A man-without-a-memory found
  floating in the Mediterranean Sea searches for his identity,
  discovering along the way pieces to the puzzle that ultimately
  paint him as a highly-trained government assassin. Reason for the
  Rating: Violence and some language. Based on the Robert
  Ludlum-authored book by the same name, THE BOURNE IDENTITY is
  part action flick, part stylized thriller. In his first role as
  an erstwhile action hero, Matt Damon shines as Bourne, imbuing
  the character with both an appropriate edginess and a
  comfortable-in-his-own-skin-even-though-he-doesn't-know-who-he-is
  ease. As the story opens, Bourne is pulled out of the
  Mediterranean Sea and treated for suspicious bullet wounds by the
  crew of an Italian fishing boat. The "hey, this is a story about
  espionage" theme is introduced early as a crew member removes a
  tiny implant from Bourne that displays what we later learn is a
  Swiss bank account number. Upon finding and opening the safe
  deposit box, Bourne discovers multiple passports (including one
  with the name Jason Bourne), a variety of foreign currency, and a
  gun. He then begins his search to uncover his true identity--and
  until now, so does the audience. If there is one misstep in THE
  BOURNE IDENTITY, it may be the fact that early scenes involving
  the CIA and the agency's frantic attempts to track him down give
  audience members the answer to Bourne's identity far earlier than
  Bourne himself. At this point the film becomes more of a "how
  will he survive?" thriller rather than a "who am I?" mystery. A
  love interest of sorts (played nicely by Run Lola Run actress
  Franka Potente) gives Bourne a "partner in crime" to play off of
  for much of the movie, but her role seems more of a plot
  contrivance rather than a reasonable or logical plot development.
  An implied (off-screen) love scene for the two is just as
  implausible as it is brief, but doesn't detract too much from the
  action. The most interesting (and morally significant) moment in
  the film comes when Bourne finally remembers who he is as well as
  the mission he was on. Through this pivotal flashback (and some
  foreshadowing that finally makes sense), we learn that the
  highly-trained killing machine isn't capable of pulling the
  trigger upon seeing his assassination target's children in the
  room with him. Bourne's hesitation nearly costs him his life and
  sets the course for the film's premise as he is shot, falling
  into the Mediterranean Sea. Smartly directed, THE BOURNE IDENTITY
  is fast-paced without feeling rushed. The Cinematographer paints
  the European setting in shades of grays and yellows, giving the
  movie a unique noir-like look that fits well with the drama. As
  an action film decorated with whodunit sensibilities, this film
  is a winner for older teens and adults. Nappaland.com Recommends:
  Ignore the plot contrivances and just enjoy the ride--THE BOURNE
  IDENTITY is a worthy discovery. After the Show...If members of
  your family choose to view this movie, use these questions to
  spark discussion about it afterward: ---What do you think
  prompted Jason Bourne to pause when he was preparing to shoot his
  assassination target on the yacht? What does this say about
  Bourne's moral compass? ---How would you feel if you suddenly
  couldn't remember who you were? What actions would you take to
  discover your identity? ---When faced with the horror of who he
  really is and what he has done, Jason Bourne longs for a chance
  to erase his past and start his life anew. When have you felt
  that way? How can a relationship with Jesus give us a "second
  chance" in the truest sense? S</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">Ladies in Lavender is a rare gem in the
  movie world of today. This is a soft spoken tale that ignores age
  and looks to character. Beautiful roles for older women may be
  hard to find these days and when a movie comes along with two
  such roles you could not ask for anything better than to have two
  wonderful Ladies, Judi Dench and Maggie Smith, take on those
  roles. This movie was adapted from a short story of the same
  title but its silver screen life comes from the actors who played
  their parts to perfection. The movie takes place in a small
  Cornish village where the viewer is given an immediate sense of
  isolation - perhaps isolation from life, from emotions and from
  vulnerabilities. The sisters Ursula and Janet Widdington, played
  by Dench and Smith, spend a quiet, uninvolved existence,
  venturing out rarely. But on one of their walks along the beach
  that they find a young man washed ashore after a storm. A bit
  befuddled they nevertheless take this young may into their home
  to help him recuperate. This one act of kindness leads to
  unexpected consequences for we see that age is not a barrier to
  unleashing emotions, feelings that have been hidden for so many
  years. It is the ability of Dench and Smith to portray these
  emotions, these feelings, for the camera that make this movie
  sing. And the melody of the movie is also carried nicely by the
  supporting roles played by Daniel Bruhl and Natascha McElhone.
  Together these actors make this move work on several levels to
  give the viewer a splendid evening's entertainment.</Text>

  <Text category="dvd">This is one of the better historical dramas
  from the 1970s. Many are stagey and slow, and while this
  production of MADAME BOVARY is very much constrained to stay
  indoors, this works to advantage for this story of a woman who
  feels so trapped by her life and her world. Emma Bovary is not a
  very sympathetic creature. She is married to a man who loves her
  with all his heart, who tries to give her everything she wants,
  is willing to ruin himself to make her happy, and she still
  cheats on him and remains miserable. In short, she is selfish and
  inconsiderate, as ugly inside as she is pretty on the outside.
  Francesca Annis plays Emma. She is indeed very beautiful. As an
  actress she often comes across as bright and hard, flirty and
  flighty, but cold and self satisfied. These qualities, of course,
  are perfect for this character. Here she seems to be more in love
  with the idea of being in love than actually loving. Almost
  anything to break up the dismal tedium of her life and her
  disgust with everyone and everything in it. It is very hard for a
  modern audience to feel sorry for her. Her daily trial does not
  include housework or drudgery, she has maids for that. She is
  bored because she is useless, she is useless because she is too
  lazy to seek something meaningful to do; she wants life to be a
  party, and resents it when it is not. Tom Conti plays her devoted
  husband, who is completely devoid of ambition, in work or
  society. As an actor, Conti often seems to have just woken from a
  nap, and this dampness is just right for Dr. Bovary. He too is
  very lazy in his way, but his seems to stem from ignorance. When
  contrasted with Emma's willfulness, her husband seems the
  infinitely better of the two. Conti is really fine here as a man
  completely out of his depth with this racehorse of a wife. In
  much the same way, while Annis is briskly carrying every scene,
  Conti just quietly steals every one of them. A perfect pairing
  for these roles. All the actors here are top notch, and the
  casting a bit off beat, which adds to the interest. The costumes,
  especially Emmas, are a luxurious parade of overindulgence.
  Absolutely beautiful. While we as an audience enjoy the parade of
  finery, we can also see how this wardrobe would drive even the
  richest man into the poorhouse. The production is topped off with
  a novel and lovely score of predominantly piano compositions;
  pretty and liltling, but melancholy and dissonant. Don't let this
  one get lost in the shuffle, it is worth seeing.</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">This documentary on the life of Louis
  Armstrong, one of the major proponents of the jazz genre of
  music, is a quick look at how Louis Armstrong developed into a
  jazz musician as a vocalist, trumpeter, band leader, and
  arranger. 'Louis Armstrong - Satchmo' starts with Louis's life
  growing up in New Orleans and how he spent much of his time in an
  orphan home playing in a band, which is where his skill had room
  to take off. The documentary follows his move to Chicago and his
  involvement in the early jazz recordings. The DVD contains
  excerpts of live performances and also tracks Louis Armstrong's
  gradual but swelling rise to fame and how he attained the
  nickname "Satchmo". Louis, with his love for performing, became a
  famous musical figure and eventually had the rare achievement of
  being featured as a performer in many movies. The docu-biography
  reveals how Louis never lost his lovable, down-to-earth manner,
  even with the increased size of his audience. Louis was just
  Louis, and he would always be loved for his smile, his lovable
  personality, and of course his music. Containing interviews with
  Tony Bennett and Wynton Marsalis, 'Louis Armstrong - Satchmo' is
  a pleaser about a jazz player's rise to become an enormously
  famous popular entertainer. And he never lost his charm. We love
  you, Louie</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">It's my first semester teaching a
  general-student Jazz History course, and I wanted something
  beyond the textbook to get the students involved. I bought this
  video as a &amp;amp;quot;best-of-all-options&amp;amp;quot;
  choice, and was bowled over by it's thoroughness and attention to
  detail. Everything we'd discussed about Armstrong during class
  was there on the tape, reinforcing my lectures and giving the
  kids a nice opportunity to both hear AND see the legendary Louis.
  For pure entertainment alone it was worthwhile, but for
  instructional purposes I'd consider it a necessity for any future
  jazz classes I'd teach. I paid $16 bucks for it, but having seen
  it I think I'd've paid fifty! (Shh! Don't tell Amazon!</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">WE ARE HALFWAY THROUGH THE FRIENDS
  SERIES...5 DOWN, 5 TO GO! The 5th Season of Friends is the season
  where: *Monica and Chandler start their relationship *Ross gets
  married...AGAIN to RACHEL out of being very very drunk! *They
  pass the 100th episode Whenever I watch Season Five all I can
  really say is that it is easily watchable and is quite good, but
  it isnt my favourite season. For some reason I notice the
  episodes are kind of all over the place and its not like it used
  to be. Dont get me wrong I still love the show and this Season is
  good, but this one isn't vital. I personally only bought this
  season for that episode where Monica has a turkey on her head
  with the big glasses and hat and then dances! I know! Stupid! Lol
  but its classic! This season Box set isnt desperately needed in
  your collection, unless you want to see Monica and Chandler start
  their relationship and hide it with Joey covering for them
  constantly (The One With Ross's Sandwich is great when Joey
  covers for Monica and Chandler!) The top 5 Episodes are very easy
  to pick for this particular season. My Personal Top 5 Episodes
  Are: The One With All The Kissing The One Hundredth (Has to be
  here! The 100th!) The One with the Thanksgiving Flashbacks The
  One Where Everybody Finds Out (BEST HERE!!!!) The One Where
  Rachel Smokes I didnt care much for the Season Finale, I mean,
  identical hand twin?? Not very funny. Very time wasting!. The
  only really good thing in the final is The Very Last Scene!!!
  Overall, not a stellar season, Not as good as Season 3 or 4 but
  definitley up there somewhere. Not desperatley needed in your
  collection, IF ONLY COLLECTING A FEW. Contains some very good
  episodes. The One Where Everybody Finds Out is a highlight! Check
  that out</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">I was never a diehard Huey Lewis fan but
  this group definitely adds to that genre we call rock n roll. If
  you're looking for another dvd you can add to your concert
  collection, this one is worth the price of admission. I'm not
  familiar with all the original members so just having Huey as the
  front man and with the other members cranking out the songs as I
  remembered them, it was memorable, high-energy performance. One
  little thing was somewhat of a distraction to me. About halfway
  through the show, Huey's shirt had a meltdown. All of a sudden it
  looked like he got caught in a major downpour. Am I the only one
  that noticed this? But it just goes to show the man was giving it
  all he had. Who could ask for more</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">The Star Trek Collection is a worthy hobby
  and certainly the largest of the television series DVD
  Collections (The Original Series, The Next Generation, Deep Space
  Nine, Voyager and Enterprise). At around 1100 minutes per box (a
  few hours less than the TOS seasons) we are still looking at
  approx 30 boxes with 700 hours of viewing. That is 1 month of
  non-stop Star Trek. No DVD series comes remotely close to that.
  Get going collecting right now and build up on each succession
  over the years. By the end you will have a very serious anthology
  that defines the word awe. This is the kind of item that requires
  1 hour a day of your time for the next few years. It is a
  cherished memory that served your fathers and will serve your
  children also. Our very planet, Earth, has advanced because of
  Gene Roddenberry's admirable concept. Roddenberry nailed the
  premise of the series when he said that he wanted to create a
  show with characters that we could look up too. `The Bridge'
  members are like our family. Watch what they do. Then go and
  spend your life striving for the same on Earth. What engineer,
  medic, scientist, teacher, worker can not say that Star Trek has
  not influenced them? The show is this significant in the
  development of our species. Even Christians respect and quote its
  authority and it is not hard to see why. The DVD case is not
  quite as fancy as the TOS (The Original Series) cases. The TNG
  case is supposed to resemble a TNG crew briefcase. The case opens
  to reveal the disc booklet inside a sleeve. Sliding the disc
  booklet out of the sleeve and flipping it open reveals a spread
  of 7 discs. There are 4 episodes per disc. However the last disc,
  disc 7, only has two episodes, for a grand total of 26 episodes
  (TOS has 8 Discs, 30 episodes). The rest of disc 7 is devoted to
  Star Trek interviews and trailers with the usual expected
  extras...and then some more. The episodes are ordered not in the
  sequence they where filmed, but in the sequence that they aired,
  however each episode has been numbered according to the order
  they where filmed in. This means on one disc you have shows 4, 2,
  12 and 1, in that order. The sound has also been remastered to
  5:1 Dolby Digital! Since the show was shot in full frame, these
  dimensions are retained. Star Trek, The Next Generation (TNG),
  Season One, had an amazing impact when it was first broadcast. An
  instant hit and a milestone in television serials (it ran for 7
  seasons unlike its predecessor that ran for 3), its characters
  and new look Enterprise had us glued to the TV with the first
  computer generated images of our solar system as Captain Picard
  utters the immortal words... `To baldly'... I mean... `To boldly
  go where no man'... I mean... `To boldly go where no one has gone
  before.' Viewing the episodes in the order they where filmed does
  not show a vision in the shaping as per the TOS series but is
  more of the same again (even remaking some TOS episodes), this
  time with more characters, more action and more special effects.
  SEASON 1 All of the main characters in the TNG series are in
  episode one, Captain Jean-Luc Picard, Commander William T. Riker,
  Lieutenant/Lt. Commander Geordi La Forge, Lieutenant Tasha Yar,
  Lieutenant Worf, Commander Dr. Beverly Crusher, Lt.
  Commander/Commander Deanna Troi, Lt. Commander Data and Ensign
  Wesley Crusher. Only Natasha Yar quits before the first season is
  finished. Commander Dr. Beverly Crusher is replaced by Doctor
  Katherine Pulaski for Season two. Ensign Wesley Crusher is only
  sometimes reoccurring after Season four. The Enterprise itself is
  beautifully rendered with additional areas such as the holodeck
  allowing for almost any environment at the users choosing,
  playing an important function in many episodes. The use of
  computer generated images (a ground-breaking television
  experience back in 1987!) allowed for inspirational subspace
  sequences, planets, backdrops, an improved bridge main viewer and
  windows! Advances in makeup effects brought new alien characters
  to life and allowed an actor to appear as if he where indeed an
  android. TNG Season One attempts to relate with TOS by reviving
  similar stories while at the same time adding on additional
  insights into new and fascinating sci-fi theory while retaining
  most of the character arcs that made TOS so interesting. The
  stories (also written by TOS's DC Fontana) are as fresh today as
  they where in the late 80s, early 90s, when TNG first aired.
  Season One of TNG is mostly about deities, infections, alien
  cultures, galactic politics, time travel, alien forces, mind
  control, family matters, computer malfunctions and Starfleet
  Academy. There are also the unforgettable episodes `Encounter at
  Farpoint' which introduces us to the crew of the Enterprise and
  the mysterious Q, `Where No One has Gone Before' a wonderful
  story about travelling the cosmos, `Datalore' which features two
  Data characters, `Heart of Glory' with some in-depth revelations
  about Klingons , `Skin of Evil' featuring some remarkable effects
  for its time with a very sad ending, and the classic `Conspiracy'
  (this episode is uncut, which features some violent scenes
  involving a head explosion edited from some daytime television
  showings [so parents be cautious]) about an invasion of the body
  snatchers type takeover of Starfleet. The bottom line for TNG:
  Season One is that it will bring back some enormously delightful
  memories for those who where awe inspired by it when it first
  came out. Although we can debate about which is the better
  series, TNG or TOS, we still absolutely adore both. We might miss
  Kirk rolling about the desert scrub with a seven foot man in a
  rubber reptile costume, but hearing Picard saying `make it so'
  just makes our day. SEASON 2 Season Two, still carries on with
  repeating much of the stories in TOS, revamping them and then
  adding some new stuff of its own, boosting Data's screen time,
  bumping up the computer generated graphics to allow for things
  like shuttlecraft launching and manoeuvres, improved alien CGI
  and an enhancement in particle effects. They even attempt a type
  of morphing. Most of the main characters from Season One are
  here, Captain Jean-Luc Picard, Commander William T. Riker (now
  with a beard), Lieutenant Commander Geordi La Forge, Lieutenant
  Commander Worf (letting his hair grow), Commander Deanna Troi
  (complete with low-cut red starfleet costume), Lt. Commander Data
  and Ensign Wesley Crusher. However obviously Commander Lieutenant
  Tasha Yar is gone but so is Dr. Beverly Crusher (who was not
  bad-looking), replaced by Doctor Katherine Pulaski (who looks
  like your granny!) for Season Two because Dr. Crusher has been
  reassigned to Starfleet Medical as explained in episode one of
  Season Three (in reality the TNG writers where having
  difficulties in developing Crusher's character, would later
  reinstate her for Season Three, dropping Pulaski because they
  felt her character was not working). Colm Meaney as Miles Edward
  O'Brien, Navigation from Season One gets more screentime, while
  the new Whoopi Goldberg chatacter, Guinan, is the wise El Aurian
  bartender in 10 Forward, the new bar room where the Enterprise
  crew get to relax. Except for this extra area the Enterprise
  itself has not gone undergone much of a revamp and this season is
  far more Enterprise based than Season One, or all of TOS, meaning
  Season Two has less planetary exploration stories which is a bit
  of a drawback, but sets a new standards in the `hotel in space'
  feel that would produce the `Deep Space Nine' series. Season Two
  of TNG is mostly about alien impregnation, mystery space, AI, the
  holodeck, interplanetary relations, rapid aging, justice,
  shape-shifting, time travel, family, the prime directive,
  kidnapping, cloning, war games and infections. The big plus side
  to not having that much planetary exploration is that there are
  lots of stories with Klingons and the first encounter with the
  BORG! The unforgettable episodes are, `Elementary, Dear Data'
  where Data takes on his Sherlock Holmes persona and we are
  introduced to the Moriarty character. `Loud as a Whisper' is
  about a deaf and dumb peace negotiator. `A Matter of Honor' is
  where Riker serves on a Klingon battleship. `Q Who?' may well be
  the best episode here because it is the first time we meet the
  Borg. The last episode of Season Two `Shades of Gray' may be one
  of the worst Star Trek episodes ever, which uses Riker's memories
  from Seasons One and Two to make up an entire episode and even
  includes the uncut scenes for the Season One episode `Conspiracy'
  featuring the violent head explosion edited from some daytime
  television showings [so parents be cautious again]). The bottom
  line for TNG: Season Two is that for all it shortcomings because
  of lack of beaming down, we get the Borg and lots and lots of
  Klingons. At this stage in the saga we might still miss Kirk
  rolling about the desert scrub with a seven foot man in a rubber
  reptile costume, but how will Picard defeat those assimilating
  half-man, half-machine entities that are heading his way? He
  better "make it so" with Season Three. SEASON 3 It was the dawn
  of the 90s and since CGI had undergone some development, the
  improvements can be seen not only in the new opening sequence,
  but with better looking planets (complete with moving gaseous
  atmospheres) and major enhancements in particle effects. Towards
  the end it undergoes new model development, lighting and subspace
  effects of a movie budget look. The crew uniform has changed with
  a new type of collar. Most of the main characters from Season Two
  are here, Captain Jean-Luc Picard, Commander William T. Riker
  (now with a bigger belly), Lieutenant Commander Geordi La Forge,
  Lieutenant Commander Worf (letting his hair grow even more),
  Commander Deanna Troi (with more makeup, costume changes and even
  an aerobics outfit [that really isn't as good as it sounds]),
  Lieutenant Commander Data and Ensign Wesley Crusher (new hairdo).
  Dr. Beverly Crusher is back (initially with a terrible hairdo
  that gets better) and Doctor Katherine Pulaski has been dropped
  from the show never to reappear again. Pulaski's disappearance is
  not officially explained (in reality Diana Muldaur was told her
  character was not working and she was offered a role in L.A. Law
  instead. McFadden was asked to rejoin the series again) the crew
  do act like she has just left because her time was up with Dr.
  Crusher making reference to Pulaski's work in Episode four.
  Commander Lieutenant Tasha Yar makes a surprise guest appearance
  for one episode! Dwight Schultz (Murdoch from the A-Team) makes
  his first appearance as Lieutenant `Reg' Barkley, who would have
  a reoccurring role. Colm Meaney is here again as Miles Edward
  O'Brien, Navigation, doesn't have much of a role boost since
  Season Two, while the Whoopi Goldberg's Guinan character of the
  wise El Aurian, the bartender in 10 Forward, has her background
  further developed. Season Three of TNG is mostly about
  nanotechnology, colonization, super aliens, the prime directive,
  orphans, ancient space booby traps, Romulans, wormholes, peace
  negotiations, defectors, super humans, terrorism, Q, court
  inquisitions, parallel universes, AI, Klingon high councils,
  captivity experiments, time travellers, biological space crafts,
  morale, the first law of robotics, Vulcans, Sarek, evolutionary
  speciation, and the Borg. Unlike Season Two there is much more
  planetary exploration and lots of alien encounters. There are
  loads of unforgettable episodes in this Season, "Evolution" where
  nanotechnology takes over the Enterprise, "The Survivors" is a
  mystery about a single household that is the only structure to
  survive an alien invasion on a whole planet, "Who Watches The
  Watchers?" is about the prime directive failing when the
  Enterprise team are spotted and kidnapped, "Offspring" sees Data
  creating another sentient android, "Sins of the Father" has Worf
  return to his Klingon homeworld to defend his family honour,
  "Hollow Pursuits" has Lt. Barkley fantasizing about crew members
  in the Holodeck, "Sarek" is about the Vulcan of the same name
  from Star Trek: The Original Series, who is back for what looks
  like his final peace negotiation, and of course the pot-boiler
  end episode of "The Best of Both Worlds, Part I" (widely
  acclaimed as one of the best Star Trek episodes ever!) marks the
  grand entrance of Locutus of Borg onto the scene. The bottom line
  for TNG: Season Three is that it is often cited by fans as the
  best TNG Season and is probably the first of the Seasons to
  really be worth the price tag demanded of these very expensive
  box sets. In Season Three everyone seems to have matured,
  included the writers who are giving us exactly what we want and
  the series has a serious enough budget to make every episode look
  like a movie, especially towards the end. There is lots in this
  season to enjoy and of course not since J.R. Ewing had been shot
  did we get the kind of cliff-hanger episode that "The Best of
  Both Worlds, Part I" would deliver on, meaning every Trekie (and
  who wasn't at this time) across the planet from LA to Hong Kong
  had to wait all summer to learn how Picard could be saved. There
  is no time to loose!!! Onto Season Four. .... wooosshhhh. SEASON
  4 Not since J.R. Ewing had been shot did we get the kind of
  cliff-hanger episode that "The Best of Both Worlds, Part I" would
  deliver on at the end of Season III, meaning every Trekie (and
  who wasn't at this time) across the planet from LA to Hong Kong
  had to wait all summer to learn how Picard could be saved. There
  was no time to lose!!! Onto Season Four. .... wooosshhhh... so
  here we are. With Season Three it was the dawn of the 90s and CGI
  had undergone some development and improvements (better looking
  planets with moving gaseous atmospheres, particle effects,
  lighting and subspace effects). With Season Three things started
  to have more of a movie budget look. Season Four tries to
  maintain that class. Most of the main characters from Season Two
  are here, Captain Jean-Luc Picard, Commander William T. Riker,
  Lieutenant Commander Geordi La Forge, Lieutenant Commander Worf
  (who keeps growing that hair), Commander Deanna Troi, Lieutenant
  Commander Data, Dr. Beverly Crusher and Ensign Wesley Crusher
  (now a Starfleet officer with full uniform, also departs from TNG
  half way through this Season, and has a recurring role instead of
  a main character in the remaining three seasons). Colm Meaney is
  here again as Miles Edward O'Brien and Whoopi Goldberg's Guinan.
  Lots of characters who had small episode roles are back for
  Season Four such as Worf's lover K'Ehleyr, the Traveller, K'Mpec
  the Klingon leader, Duras whose dishonesty caused Worf's
  discommendation and the Romulan Tomalak. There is also a surprise
  character at the end of this season. Season Four of TNG is mostly
  about the Borg, family, Dr. Soong and the AI emotion chip,
  adoption, the space-time continuum, hostage rescue, the Klingon
  High Council, Romulans, alternative universes, holographic
  projection, survival, loosing special abilities, renegade
  captains, the devil, amnesia, first contact, love, nightmares,
  mutations, super intelligence, Robin Hood, witch hunt trials,
  euthanasia, host life forms, mind control and honour. Like Season
  Three most the episodes in Season Four have great stories,
  combining both planetary exploration and the life of the crew
  instead of dealing with either one or the other as the initial
  seasons did. It is a well balanced season overall and a good deal
  more exciting than maybe its three previous seasons now that
  things are firmly established. Apart from containing Part II of
  `The Best of Both Worlds', the introduction of the Cardassians,
  who would become major players in the Star Trek: Deep Space Nine
  franchise, makes it even more valuable. There are loads of
  unforgettable episodes in this Season, `The Best of Both Worlds,
  Part II' concludes the cliff-hanger from Season Three with some
  great battle special effects, `Family' has Picard going home to
  see his brother and family, `Brothers' features Dr. Soong who is
  Data's creator, `Reunion' returns to the story of Worf and his
  Klingon dishonour, `The Wounded' features the Cardassians for the
  first time, `Clues' has Data disobeying Picard, `First Contact'
  sees Riker exposed as an alien on a planet he is monitoring, the
  `The Nth Degree' has Barclay taking control of the Enterprise
  with his new special powers of intelligence, `QPid' for its
  historical recreation of Robin Hood and of course `Redemption,
  Part I' which deals with Worf's dishonour. The bottom line for
  TNG: Season Four is that it keeps up the pace of Season Three,
  and is worth the price tag demanded of these very expensive box
  sets. Everyone has matured and the writers are giving us exactly
  what we want. Although not quite the cliff-hanger end episode
  that "The Best of Both Worlds, Part I" was, `Redemption, Part I'
  still concerns the loss of a main character to the other side and
  introduces the surprise return of a person we know. We are left
  asking ourselves, if the `hard man' is really gone and why does
  `she' look like a Romulian! As Picard would say "I can live with
  a mystery" but we just can't! Onto Season Five as quick as we
  can... SEASON 5 Season 5 has a remarkable improvement in visual
  effects. The display panels on the enterprise are more
  interactive. The camera can now pan as special effects take
  place. Deep space battles seem more intense. We also get a new
  Star Trek title graphic in the opening sequence. The cliff-hanger
  conclusion of "Redemption, Part II" is a great episode although
  slightly lacking in the promise of a civil war battle between
  Klingons, Romulans and the Federation, turns out to be more of a
  character episode than the big epic battler we thought we would
  get. None-the-less, it is still a good episode that reveals some
  things about the family of Tasha Yar. Most of the main characters
  from Season Two are here, Captain Jean-Luc Picard (with a new red
  suede coat and grey uniform), Commander William T. Riker,
  Lieutenant Commander Geordi La Forge (who sports a new beard in
  one episode), Lieutenant Commander Worf (who left the Enterprise
  in Season Four), Commander Deanna Troi, Lieutenant Commander Data
  and Dr. Beverly Crusher. Ensign Wesley Crusher (who departed from
  Season Four half way and has a recurring role instead of a main
  character in the remaining three seasons) returns for some
  episodes but is mainly replaced by the new Ensign Ro Laren, a
  Bajoran. Colm Meaney is here again as Miles Edward O'Brien as is
  Whoopi Goldberg's Guinan. Alexander Rozhenko as Worf's son now
  has a reoccurring role since Season Four. Keiko O'Brien, (Miles
  O'Brien's wife) is firmly established as a reoccurring character.
  Watch out for the special appearances of Ashley Judd as Ensign
  Robin Lefler and Leonard Nimoy as Spock! Whoot! Whoot! Strangely
  enough this is the only season where Q, of the omnipotent Q
  Continuum, does not make an appearance. Lieutenant Reginald
  Barclay, engineer is also absent from this Season. Season Four of
  TNG is mostly about the Klingon High Council, Romulans,
  communication, Bajora, crystalline entities, disasters,
  addiction, reunification, time travel, parenting, telekinesis,
  eugenics, amnesia, possession, euthanasia, sexual repression,
  time warps, children, cover-ups, sexual attraction, imaginary
  friends, Borg, invisibility, alternative lives and phase
  shifting. Like Season Four most the episodes in Season Five have
  great stories, a perfect balance of planetary exploration and the
  life of the crew. It much more of the same as in Season Four with
  the better episodes being `Redemption, Part II', `Darmok' an
  interesting episode about language, the introduction of the
  Bajora and Ensign Ro, the Silicon Avatar makes a return,
  `Unification', Part I and II (both here) with Spock may be one of
  the most popular double episodes in the whole TNG franchise,
  certainly more popular than `Time's Arrow', Part I which ends
  this season with the possibility of something strange happening
  to Data on Earth. `The Masterpiece Society' shows what happens
  when a special genetically engineered race has contact from the
  outside world. Huge of Borg also makes his first appearance in
  `I, Borg'. Apart from the `Unification' double episode, the
  instalments `Ethics', about Worf undergoing a major controversial
  surgical operation and `The Game', when entertainment becomes
  mind control, have both achieved cult status as some of the best
  TNG episodes ever aired. Season Five unfortunately has some dull
  episodes too, many of which occur in the second half of the
  season, so the best stuff is within the first four discs. It
  doesn't really create much drive to push for a quick follow up
  with Season Six, but no doubt because Six is as good as Five was,
  then we are there for it. As a note: "Redemption part II" - this
  episode received as 12 age rating in the UK, because it contains
  Klingon ritual head butting. `Violations' also has sexually
  violent content (psychic rape). Parents may want to be cautious
  and view those two episodes before showing it to children. If you
  are going to move onto Season Six then you will probably want to
  know that during Season Six the crew make contact with Deep Space
  Nine. So if you get Deep Space Nice: Season One you can sync up
  the star dates and watch both franchises in chronological order.
  If you are in for Six you may also be in for Season One of DS9!
  SEASON 6 Season 6 is generally considered the pinnacle of the
  series for the wind down to the Season 7 conclusion and of course
  the wake of popularity that Star Trek, Deep Space Nine: Season 1
  whipped up while Season 6 was running. 1993 was TV Sci-Fi heaven
  with fans getting a double dose of ST for the year. This means
  for the folks who have been watching TOS and TNG, now is the time
  to do a special chronological order of star dates alternating
  between TNG Season 6 and DS9 Season 1. You can find the order if
  you search the new for it. TNG has really good stories while DS9
  gets the effects. We are no longer happy to see a new interactive
  flat panel as the driving force of a story. Season 6 answers with
  substance to characters and stories with some surprises (Picard
  acting like a Russian is hysterical. Would you sacrifice his
  authority role for that quality humour from him from time to
  time? Maybe yes!). The conclusion of "Time's Arrow" is not the
  best cliff-hanger but sufficient. Most of the main characters
  from Season Two are here, Captain Jean-Luc Picard, Commander
  William T. Riker, Lieutenant Commander Geordi La Forge,
  Lieutenant Commander Worf, Commander Deanna Troi, Lieutenant
  Commander Data and Dr. Beverly Crusher. Ensign Wesley Crusher
  (who departed from Season Four half way and has a recurring role
  instead of a main character in the remaining seasons) returns for
  some episodes but is mainly replaced by the new Ensign Ro Laren,
  a Bajoran. Colm Meaney is here again as Miles Edward O'Brien but
  will be transferred to DS9 (his absence is not mentioned). Whoopi
  Goldberg's Guinan is back along with Alexander Rozhenko. Keiko
  O'Brien, (Miles O'Brien's wife) will also leave for DS9.
  Lieutenant Reginald Barclay, engineer is back after being absent
  from Season 5. Season 6 of TNG is mostly about transporter
  psychosis, empaths, Scotty!, alien abductions, Q, age regression,
  android dreams, artificial life, Cardassians, Prof. Moriarty,
  love, Romulan defection, destiny, Klingon birthrights, thieves,
  command ethics, origins of life, insanity, murder, faith,
  doubles, time travel and the Borg. Like Season 5 most the
  episodes in Season 6 have above average sci-fi stories, combing
  planetary exploration and the life of the crew. Memorable
  episodes include, A Fistful of Datas, The Quality of Life, Ship
  in a Bottle, Face of the Enemy, Birthright and lessons. There are
  three very good episodes which really make the season worth.
  Tapestry sees Picard given the opportunity to relive his youth
  without the night he fought with a gang who stabbed him through
  the heart. Suspicion is a great whodunit episode (of which there
  are a few) with one of the coolest Star Trek aliens ever (should
  have made him a main character). Descent Part I is a very nice
  slight of hand trick. You will keep thinking Hugh right up until
  the last second. SEASON 7 Star Trek: Season 7 is of course
  winding down to a conclusion, making way for some Star Trek
  films, but in reality it is Deep Space Nine: Season 2 (DS9:
  Season 1 starts in star date chronological order with TNG: Season
  6) that is the new trek. Fans of Star Trek got their twofold
  measure of these series through 1993 and 1994 making it an
  exceptional SF TV era. The conclusion of "Descent, Part II" has
  the finale of Lore. Most of the main characters from Season Two
  are here, Captain Jean-Luc Picard, Commander William T. Riker,
  Lieutenant Commander Geordi La Forge, Lieutenant Commander Worf,
  Commander Deanna Troi, Lieutenant Commander Data and Dr. Beverly
  Crusher. Ensign Wesley Crusher (who departed from Season Four
  half way and has a recurring role instead of a main character in
  the remaining seasons) returns for one episode. While Ensign Ro
  Laren, a Bajoran, was supposed to replace him, she only appears
  in one episode in Season 7, although the episode is a major one
  focused on her. Colm Meaney shows up again as Miles Edward
  O'Brien for the last episode. Whoopi Goldberg's Guinan is gone
  without explanation (see the movie "Star Trek: Nemesis" on her).
  Alexander Rozhenko is back. Keiko O'Brien, (Miles O'Brien's wife)
  is not here either (after leaving for DS9). Lieutenant Reginald
  Barclay, engineer, is back again. Season 6 of TNG is mostly about
  Lore, emotional studies, interfaces, mercenaries, nightmares,
  psychic trauma, Beverly and Picard, warp travel environmental
  damage, data's mother, alternate realities, the Pegasus, Worf's
  human brother, incubus, top secret missions, radiation sickness,
  deities, Troi and Worf, reverse evolution, Wesley and the
  Traveller, Klingon right of ascension, Picard's son, abiogenesis,
  Ro Laren and time travel. While there are some hit and miss
  episodes and a really terrible one ("Masks" for example is one of
  the worst of the entire franchise) most are well above average
  and some are incredible. Memorable episodes include, Gambit,
  Forces of Nature, Inheritance, Lower Decks, Thine Own Self,
  Journey's end and Bloodlines. The Pegasus is probably the best
  episode of the Season, but the finale "All good things..." is
  really where it is at with some good aging effects, a possible
  future with an older looking cast and an futuristic Enterprise to
  die for. The series ends very warmly and with a nicer note about
  the possibilities of looking within instead of charting stars and
  galaxies for a newer greater trek. In short there is nothing like
  ST:TNG. It evolved TV serials into mega media and ran for a full
  span of 7 years. It set a new benchmark and placed the bar as
  high as the stars. All we can say about this awe-inspiring series
  can be summed up in one word... ...AMEN.</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">Filmed at New York's Improv in 1971, we see
  a young Pryor working on perfecting the kind of material that
  made him famous. More polished versions of some of these routines
  may be found on the 1971 album &amp;amp;quot;Craps After
  Hours.&amp;amp;quot; However, witness the powerful moment when he
  alludes to his mother's prostitution, then drops his head in
  sadness and takes a drag from his cigarette after realizing what
  he has just said. This scene alone is worth the price of
  admission in this important look at what was to come</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">Very entertaining movie. I enjoyed
  everything about this movie--- the acting, the humor, the singing
  and storyline! Also being from San Diego originally, it was nice
  to see famous hotel and landmark, The Hotel Del Coronado, being
  used in this movie as the hotel in which the all girls band
  performed and stayed! No the hotel wasn't The Seminole Ritz in
  Florida!</Text>

  to purchase the entire series of the "Adventures of Superman"
  (played by George Reeves); the full set of all the episodes
  consists of 12 packed DVD's (I got mine all at once in a 3-pack

  <Text category="dvd">There can't be a better storyteller than
  Teddy Ruxpin. As I child I was enthralled with this animated
  story and would impatiently play with my toy Teddy Ruxpin as I
  waited for Saturday morning to come again so I could see another
  episode of the TV series. This show has a clear progression of
  plot development that starts right from episode one. So many
  cartoons are just one-shots, an individual small plot for each
  episode. Teddy Ruxpin was an epic adventure that caught you up
  and carried you along for a fantastic adventure! Along the way,
  kids learn important morals, values, and a lot about their own
  world. This is a fantastic cartoon to share with children of any
  age. And what a great price! Well worth it!</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">Millionaire Fredrick Loren played by a young
  Vincent Price invites five strangers to a party in the House On
  Haunted Hill. With his delectable wife Annabel in tow, he has set
  the strangers a task of sorts, if they can spend one night locked
  in the house he will give them $10,000 each, however there is a
  bit of a catch to this seemingly generous offer, the house has
  seen several brutal murders and is reputed to be haunted. One of
  the guests in the house was even related to one of the victims
  and he is emphatic that the whole house is haunted and that they
  are all doomed because of what they are doing. At midnight the
  door is locked and everyone in the house waits to see what will
  happen next, and very soon all are locked into a game of terror
  and murder as the House on Haunted Hill takes on a life of its
  own, but there is a twist in the tale that is deliciously
  surprising as it is fun. I enjoyed this film, it wasn't overly
  suspenseful, but there are enough scenes to make you jump every
  now and then, the special effects were none-existent and there
  was a lot of screaming and shrieking from the character Norah a
  young woman who appears to be being targeted by the ghosts in the
  house. All in all a hokum of a movie but great fun all the
  same.</Text>

  <Text category="dvd">This DVD teaches the history of Tai Chi, and
  the History of the 24 posture form and 48 posture form. It
  explains that these two Tai Chi forms were originally a martial
  art style, and that now they are usually done for health
  improvement. Then it shows the 24 posture form from the front,
  and the back, and with breathing instructions. Im not quite ready
  to try to coordinate my breathing with the movements, but when I
  am, this is a great guide. It then shows each of the 24 postures,
  and their original martial art applications, which helps you have
  a strong intent during the posture, and keeps your arms and legs
  in proper position. THEN, it teaches the 24 posture form, step by
  step, with very detailed instruction. This is a much more
  expanded version of this video by Master Liang than the original
  VHS. The DVD also shows the 48 posture form, which repeats
  several of the movements from the 24 posture form, and has other
  movements from other styles. It has absolutely helped me develop
  strength and balance in a few short weeks of practicing only the
  24 posture form about 4 days a week on average. It has also
  improved my confidence, and people keep saying I have a glow
  about me. I just feel healthier, and happier too. This DVD is
  easy to learn from quickly. The Chinese bamboo flute music is
  nice. Oh, actually, my FAVORITE part is at the end, it shows a
  'slideshow' of photos of the master, doing each posture
  move-by-move, with great music. I like to do my form along to
  this section, because it is a bit slower than the actual form,
  and you can exactly match your movements to the master. Its like
  having a one-on-one class with him. I find that this mimicing of
  his postures has helped me to learn more quickly. I remember the
  form now, without having to 'THINK', so I can try to turn my
  attention inward. A great DVD</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">Flying Down to Rio is the film that marks
  the first pairing of Ginger Rogers and Fred Astaire. The two are
  not the main attraction though; the film stars Dolores del Rio
  and Gene Raymond in a tempestuous love affair. Raymond is a band
  leader who always falls for beautiful women. Del Rio is engaged
  to a man in Rio de Janeiro but secretly harbors feelings for the
  American. In a back and forth romance, the two occupy plenty of
  the film. The rest is taken by extravagant musical numbers
  including "I Like Music," "The Carioca," and "Orchids in the
  Moonlight" on top of a wonderful number that exhibits chorus
  girls dancing on top of airplanes! The cast is good and the story
  is pretty standard, but it is the music that spices up the film.
  Definitly take a look at this movie, which is filled with inuendo
  only pre-code films could get away with and music only those
  early musicals featured</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">Jean Renoir's masterpiece, 'the grand
  illusion', is truly a film about humanity - it is a universal
  theme, something we can all understand and relate to. The triumph
  of the human spirit in the most troubled times, is kind of an
  ironic theme considering Hitler's imminent rise to power and the
  ensuing war that would alter the course of history. Nevertheless,
  Jean Renoir's poetic homage to brotherhood is one of his most
  beloved films. It is not hard to like this movie the acting and
  direction are superb - Jean Gabin is one of the all time great
  actors.. Jean Renoir's innovative approach would influence
  countless directors to come, including Orson Welles.. Criterion
  did a marvelous job on this dvd - also worth getting is 'the
  rules of the game' jean renoir's greatest satire</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">I loved the book and I feel that this movie
  did it justice. The actresses are new favorites of mine, and I
  feel they really captured the spirit of the characters. The movie
  really does a fantastic job of transporting viewers to 19th
  century England just as the book does. I would definately
  recommend this movie and the book.</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">Maybe the most engaging documentary ever
  made. Brilliant style is used in telling the story of one of the
  giants of the movie industry, producer Robert Evans. Giving
  magical illumination and motion to still pictures in a way that I
  could only describe as psychedelic. Being a film fanatic for the
  last 43 years I was shocked and ashamed to find that I had not
  heard of Robert Evans. In all my reading of credits over the
  years I had somehow missed his name. I had remembered seeing
  William Castle's name at the beginning of Rosemary's Baby but not
  Evan's. Then, at finding out that he was the driving force behind
  Love Story, The Godfather, The Godfather Pt.2, Chinatown and one
  of my personal favorites The President's Analyst and that he was
  a big reason why those movies were so good, well I was just
  dumbfounded. And these are just a fraction of the films he's
  produced. Of course he didn't start as a producer. He had been in
  women's apparel with his brother and accredited their endeavours
  as the reason why women wear pants today. While lounging around a
  pool one day he was discovered by Norma Shearer, lauching his
  career into show biz. It seems he knows everybody and I mean
  everybody. After watchng this extraordinary film I called my
  father to ask him if he had ever heard of this astonishing
  personality. I queried, "Have you ever heard of Robert Evans?"
  anxiously awaiting a "No" so I could tell him all about this
  amazing show biz entity. He replied, "You mean Bob Evans." Yes
  indeed, it seems he knows EVERYBODY. My father had come across
  him in his days as a buyer for Macy's. I asked, "Do you know what
  he does now?" "He's some sort of movie director or something now,
  isn't he.", Dad answered. I bought him the audiobook. Evans
  narrates both the documentary and the audiobook, both which are
  drawn from his autobiograghy by the same name. His voice is
  almost as amazing as his story and probably greatly enabled his
  prowess. He also lent his voice to the short-lived, hysterically
  irreverent cartoon series Kid Notorious that still airs on Comedy
  Central. All in all, whether you know Evans or not this is a
  fascinating, beautifully made film about a producer whose
  achievements are arguably greater than Thalberg's and Selznick's
  combined. The story of his life and loves is the stuff of legends
  and it goes on and on. This is a must see for anyone interested
  in Tinseltown. PS:I don't usually care for the added features but
  these are worthwhile and the credits to the main part of the
  documentary are alone worth the price of the disc. What a hoot
  and more proof that he knows everybody. Ask your dad. Who
  knows?</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">Seinfeld-Season 6 would see the sitcom
  finally hit #1 in the Nielsen ratings. This was also the season
  where the storylines became more complicated as Jerry, Elaine,
  George, and Kramer would all be involved in one caper or another
  in the same episode. George's parents, Frank and Estelle
  Costanza, as well as Jerry's parents, Morty and Helen Seinfeld,
  and Newman are featured more prominently and we also see the
  debut of several strong role players such as Mr. Pitt, David
  Puddy, and Kenny Bania. Amazingly, the storylines stayed strong
  throughout the season as several episodes would become classics.
  And while Jerry was usually considered the weakest of the four
  main actors, his work improved a lot during this season. Disc 1
  starts the season out strong with the excellent episodes "The Big
  Salad" and "The Pledge Drive" as well as the hysterical classic,
  "The Couch." "The Chinese Woman" and "The Gymnast" are also very
  good episodes, both showing the continuing neuroses of the
  Costanzas. The sitcom always seems to have great episodes on Disc
  2 and this is no exception with "The Soup", "The Switch", where
  we finally learn Kramer's first name, and "The Race" all being
  classic episodes. Disc 3 is also top notch, featuring the
  excellent "The Scofflaw", "The Kiss Hello", and "The Doorman",
  also known as "The Bro", as well as the two-part "Highlights of
  100" episode. Disc 4 starts out with the classic episode "The
  Jimmy", which earned Michael Richards an Emmy for Best Supporting
  Actor, the excellent "The Fusili Jerry", and the strong season
  finale, "The Understudy", which mirrors the Tonya Harding/Nancy
  Kerrigan fiasco, only with Bette Midler, of all people, playing
  the victim. As usual, the extras are just as strong as the
  episodes. The Running With the Egg featurette that shows how an
  episode of Seinfeld is created is probably the best feature thus
  far in the Seinfeld series. The bloopers are also very funny from
  this season, especially the ones from "The Fusili Jerry" episode.
  The deleted scenes, inside looks, exclusive stand-up material,
  and the Notes About Nothing are also top notch. Although not
  quite on the level of Season 4, which was their best season,
  Season 6 was another great season for Seinfeld as the writing was
  still top notch and the ensemble cast was running on all
  cylinders. Highly recommended.</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">&amp;amp;quot;Monkey Business&amp;amp;quot;
  looks pretty good on DVD 50 years later. The restoration
  comparison on the DVD shows the change the restoration brought, a
  bit darkly tinted, and more defined. The wild plot keeps you
  glued to the screen throughout. Marilyn Monroe who is the star on
  the DVD box has more of a supporting role here. She is great as
  the secretary Lois Laurel who shows up early because the boss
  doesn't like her punctuation. Cary Grant as the addled Professor
  Barnaby Fulton turns in a great journeyman performance, getting
  appropriately loony when experiencing the euphoria of youth. His
  driving sequence with Monroe had me turning in my chair with
  laughter to avoid the trucks! Ginger Rogers as wife Edwina gets
  pretty wacky when returned to youth. If all youth were as
  lighthearted as these comedic versions, it'd be a laugh and
  guffaw every time the school bell rings. Hugh Marlowe as the
  straight-laced attorney Hank Entwhistle does a nice job of
  standing stoic during the crazy Indian game. Oscar winner Charles
  Coburn (1943, The More the Merrier) does a great job of
  appreciating Monroe's assets as Oliver Oxly, the CEO. Kathleen
  Freeman as Mrs. Brannigan gives a fine performance. The DVD
  offers perviews of many Monroe films. This is a great little
  piece of cinematic history. Turn back the clock &amp;amp;amp;

  <Text category="dvd">I owned the VHS version of ''The Wild,Wild
  World'' but decided to get the DVD this winter. WELL..That was a
  great purchase ! I understand people that could see the
  documentary of Jayne in Europe,as pretty cheaply made,BUT it is
  still Jayne,and if you love her (as I do),any film she was in
  (except The Girl can't help it,and Will Success Spoil Rock
  Hunter) was done on the cheap,with ridiculously small budgets.
  'The Wild,Wild World' gives you the chance to see a candid Jayne
  in all kinds of very campy situations,and the best scenes are
  when Jayne pretends to be offended by the goings-on... It shows a
  Jayne Mansfield who was indeed a true-original,rather eccentric
  person in the anal-retentive American Fifties.I can't help
  comparing her to what Anna Nicole Smith has done with her
  'career' as a media sensation,BUT Jayne was doing basically the
  same FIFTY years ago,which was understandbly much more shocking
  for the common-folks. When Jayne talks about her film roles,you
  wonder if she is laughing with you or at herself. I don't
  understand how she can be compared to Marilyn Monroe.MM was
  looking for privacy,more serious roles,spoke to journalists only
  if she absolutely had to,when Jayne was waking up her daughter in
  the middle of the night to prepare drinks for journalists who
  needed something to write about.Jayne was not too picky about her
  roles,and the kind of attention she was getting,and it was her
  undoing.Sad,but she needed the money to keep up that image,all
  those children,dogs,and...husbands. NOW ,about ''The Labyrinth of
  Sex'': It is HYSTERICAL !! and a great choice to make the DVD a
  double-feature,just like the good-old days of the Drive-ins !
  When you get over the awful dubbing,the documentary is rather
  well made,naive to today's standards of course,but
  well-intentionned.Some viewers will just see
  crass-exploitation,but if you are into Campy,Kitsch movies,and
  you see Ed Wood Jr. as a genius...well you will love IT !.The
  movie trailers are very funny as well,and make you wish you could
  find them. So my conclusion is that DVD is an EXCELLENT
  purchase,a must-have for any serious Jayne Mansfield Fan
  !!</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">After I watched this sequel I realized it
  was not as good as the first but I did enjoy it.</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">I read over some of the other people's
  opinions regarding this movie and cannot agree with them about
  it. My kids ages 6 &amp;amp; 2 loved this movie from start to
  finish. The music, the characters, and the story were great for
  the entire family. I definitely recommend this movie for your
  family's movie collection</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">The musical was a virtual voyage back to my
  childhood when I saw it for the first time. My husband is no
  "square" and he enjoyed it all. Seniors would love to see it
  again. The film was obviously preserved well and the color was
  enriched beautifully for this dvd</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">This was a delightful view into the highs
  and lows of courtship, love, jealousy, and hate and what havoc
  can be wrought by schemes devised to satisfy emotional turmoil.
  With the lovely backdrop of Italy, all is well that ends well for
  the characters. Michael Keaton as comic relief is
  brilliant.</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">Arturo Bandini (Colin Farrell) arrives from
  Colorado to Los Angeles. He is an aspiring writer who is getting
  down to his last nickel. He prays for inspiration to find another
  interesting story to write. He meets a mexican waitress, Camilla
  (Salma Hayek) in a cafe and they just don't like each other, or
  do they? Finally Auturo hits the mother lode. A letter he wrote
  has been changed into a short story for publishing along with a
  handsome paycheck. It is just enough for him to buy a new suit
  outfit, a few suppers and pay the rent for a while. Arturo is a
  very well mannered man, but keeps meeting these strange
  characters that get him all wrong. Plays like film noir. The
  cinematography of 1934 Los Angeles is wonderful. Colin Farrell
  and Salma Hayek in the moonlit ocean was breathtaking. Colin
  Farrell perfected his American accent. Very tastefully down
  skinny-dipping scenes and beautiful to watch. AH! Give Colin a
  break. The water was cold. DVD includes Audio commentary, making
  of..., theatrical trailer</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">I thought... what the heck, I'll watch it.
  So I did. I loved it. I was SO surprised none of the critics
  liked it. It was well made and the characters are all rather
  believable. I was surprised at how many bad reviews it got. I
  thought it was rather good</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">I really forgot how good some of those first
  season early episodes were until I bought the season 1 DVD. "Skin
  Deep" is probably the most entertaining episode of the series.
  Other standouts are "China Doll" and "J "Digger" Doyle". What I
  enjoyed most was the 1982 crossover episode as the featuring
  Gerald McRaney and Jamison Parker from Simon and Simon from
  season 2. Also the Simon episode "Emeralds are a girls best
  friend" and although not as big a fan of later seasons, the 2
  part season 5 opener w/ a young unknown Sharon Stone playing a
  psycho...big surprise there. I found it neat with the discoesque
  theme song for the first 10 episodes too. You could see how the 4
  main characters found their niche as the season progressed</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">Martin Short is priceless in this movie - I
  enjoyed every minute.</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">Briefly speaking, If you liked Tony Jaa in
  "Ong-Bak " you'll love "The Protector." The plots are cut from
  the same mold (in this movie, Jaa attempts to recover elephants,
  instead of a statue head, that were stolen from his village by
  ruthless criminals). The choreography is faster paced and more
  dynamic (and there's more of it!); once again showcasing Jaa's
  fantastic martial arts ability. Since the script and the acting
  are not on the high end of the cinema achievement scale, the
  producers were smart to put the emphasis on mindboggling stunts
  and martial arts choreography. This movie is great. I hope I'm
  not placing a jinx by saying Tony Jaa is destined to become a
  legend. He is the greatest martial artist we've seen on screen in
  many years.</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">I saw this THAI horror film about 3 years
  ago. I have to say this is the best supernatural thriller made
  from Thailand, and I have seen a fair share of them(Nang nak, the
  sisters, mae nak, art of the devil series). The film focuses on
  Tun and his girlfriend Jane. Tun, a photographer reunites with
  his old friends. On the way home, they accidentally hit a girl
  with their car and from then on, Tun sees ghostly apparitions
  whenever he takes pictures or whenever he tries to develop them.
  Ok, I am not spoiling anything, the story is more complex than it
  sounds. Tun and his friends have a past that catches up to them,
  with Jane caught in the middle. As usual, there is a vengeful
  spirit going around killing people. "Shutter" refers to his
  camera and what it represents. "Sometimes the dead cannot let go
  of their loved ones.." I'm stopping here, I don't want to give
  out anymore. The plot is not that complex, but believe me when I
  say, the film is well-made. It does a great job of putting things
  together, each shocking scene is linked to the past and the
  present. I didn't see any scene wasted and it has that very
  atmospheric, creepy feel to it. Also, there is a scene in the
  movie that Tun and Jane looked at ACTUAL photos of ghostly
  apparitions in a polaroid. Honestly, this film has some great
  scenes that can make the hairs on the back of your neck stand on
  end the very first time you watch it and the "shock ending" has
  the greatest twist of any horror flick I've seen! I've seen a lot
  of horror films, only THE EXORCIST and THE OMEN ever
  scared/creeped me out, and SHUTTER came very close. My female
  friends were scared out of their wits when they saw it at my
  place. Since I haven't seen the TARTAN release and I only own the
  region-3 DTS-ES rlease from PanMedia (Hong Kong)but Tartan
  usually uses the same transfers from either the HONG KONG or
  KOREAN versions. The video is sufficient, with some dark and
  bright contrast. It is not free of grain but it does add to the
  atmospheric feel. the DTS soundtrack is great though, very crisp
  and loud. The english subtitles are excellent, the Thai language
  track is the only way to watch as it was meant to be seen. A
  DEFINITE must-see if you are a fan of ASIAN HORROR or horror
  films in general. It rivals RINGU, ONE MISSED CALL and the
  original JU-ON 1 and 2. FOUR AND 1/2 STARS!</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">For those reviewers who have not seen the
  remakes, see DAIL M FOR MURDER by Alfred Hitchcock, PERFECT
  MURDER starring Michael Douglas and Gyneth Paltrow, not to
  mention countless TV movies of the week. This is the original and
  the best.Barbara Stanwyck is superb, as is Burt Lancaster. Moody
  and dark and suspenseful.</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">I found I did enjoy this movie, even though
  the director took liberties. It doesn't follow so much the novel
  by Jane Austen, but if you haven't read the book and are unable
  to do the comparisons, this movie is enjoyable. I gave 4 stars
  because of the liberties taken by the director, but did like what
  I saw</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">I mean that statement in two ways. First, in
  my humble opinion, this is Martin Scorcese at his finest. This is
  better than Goodfellas by a wide margin. All of the regulars give
  awesome performances in this (even Sharon Stone, who I can't
  stand!). If you like mafia pictures, this is the BEST one to own.
  I also mean that it's a great picture due to the fact that it's
  on HD-DVD. The picture is astonishingly vivid and clear and the
  lights of Las Vegas really jump out of the television. It's
  almost 3-D ! The extras are ample, but I'd say adequate. That's
  the reason I give it 4 stars instead of 5. There is the
  obligitory commentary, deleted scenes, and a couple featurettes.
  It's all whipped cream and a cherry on top of an excellent sundae
  ! I do like that you can watch the extras and the movie at the
  same time with commentary running. This and Batman Begins are the
  reasons you should own an HD DVD player ! Note: I have the HD DVD
  drive attached to my Xbox 360 and it works brilliantly !</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">This is fantastic! Great music, Great story,
  Awesome photography! I promise you will love this film</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">Every time this movie comes on my husband
  (who is English) and I watch it and laugh our heads off.If you
  have ever been in an English train station,drinking weak,watery
  cups of tea out of dirty,cracked cups.Smelling mildew and stale
  cigarettes while you freeze to death you would see the humor in
  anyone being romantically moved while sitting there.And not to be
  crule,but these are not exactly a couple of sex-pots.The thought
  of two stodgy old English people being driven wild by their
  passion for each other is,well------------------ hilarious! I
  give it 5 stars for being so darn funny.Oh--- and the music----
  PLEASE!!!!!!!!!! But it is worth watching for a good laugh</Text>

  <Text category="dvd">Director: Denzel Washington Cast: Denzel
  Washington, Derek Luke, Joy Bryant, Salli Richardson, Malcolm
  David Kelley, Cody Hodges, Leonard Earl Howze, Novella Nelson.
  Running Time: 120 minutes Rated PG-13 for violence, language and
  mature thematic material involving child abuse. Based on a true
  story, and with a screenplay written by the eponymous hero from
  his own book, "Antwone Fisher" is at heart a study of
  psychological disturbance, laced with reasonable amounts of
  Hollywood sugar and optimism about the human spirit. It's a
  peculiarly American medicine, swallowed less willingly in some
  markets than others, which probably explains why criticism of the
  film often confused Denzel Washington's directorial talents
  (which are generally good) with the various workings of his
  film's plot, which can be argued about. Antwone Fisher's story
  starts in the navy, where after a particularly vivid nightmare he
  slugs a fellow shipmate, and is hauled up before the Captain.
  Sent to navy psychiatrist Jerome Davenport (Washington), he
  begins to work out issues of anger that, it turns out, stem from
  an abused childhood to which is added a guilt complex over a dead
  friend. At the same time Fisher (played exceptionally well by
  newcomer Derek Luke), struggles to establish a first adult
  romantic relationship with the inviting Cheryl (Joy Bryant). In a
  parallel plot thread, Washington's character, the ever-reasonable
  Dr. Davenport, is having marital problems. In due course we
  discover that he has things to learn about communicating too and
  Fisher is a catalyst for his own change. Fisher's screenplay
  reached the cameras by a somewhat circuitous route: after his
  stint in the navy and with little writing experience, he was
  hired by a Sony executive to write his own story - a process
  which apparently underwent over 40 drafts before it was
  acceptable. Most of the weaknesses of the film can be traced to
  the uncertainties he brings to his new craft, although
  Washington's direction papers reasonably well over many cracks.
  The most unconvincing elements are those subplots that revolve
  around the main character. These include the psychiatrist's
  ironic domestic problems, as well as Fisher's tentative love
  life. One is tempted to see these narrative distractions as
  rather manipulative bolt-on elements, leavening the appeal of a
  central, harrowing, personal history. The Fisher - Cheryl romance
  for instance, while in context necessarily clumsy, is also
  ultimately gauche. And once consummated, it is left to languish
  without further comment, as if further exploration of this side
  to Fisher's maturing was unnecessary. Perhaps sensing this
  central weakness, Fisher's script introduces another element into
  the young African-American's tortured life as a foster child.
  During flashbacks he has to deal with 'slave-nation'
  justifications from Mrs. Tate (Novella Nelson), suggesting a link
  between the hurt done to the individual and that presumably done
  to the whole black race - a reasoning which is frankly
  unconvincing and none too interesting. Significantly, such issues
  are given short shrift by the psychiatrist himself, and soon
  disappear from view. On the plus side is the central performance
  by Derek Luke as the hero, a perfectly judged acting job, that
  neatly balances inner rage and confusion - "I don't know what to
  do" - with lack of self-pity. Washington's role is also well
  done. Given the difficulty of the actor-director role, he is to
  be applauded for carrying off both so effectively and without
  fuss, either in front or behind the camera. This is Washington's
  directorial debut and he does an admirable job of painting a
  thorough picture of Antwone and even though the film could have
  benefited from some tighter editing, it's still a film that
  delivers all the emotional goods. Arguably the most impressive
  thing about this film is the casting of Luke who was a total
  unknown actor with a mere handful of television credits to his
  resume and obviously Washington knew he possessed the right goods
  to pull off the role. Despite its flaws, "Antwone Fisher" is an
  intriguing look into the real life of an estranged, enigmatic
  individual; it is a film that will stimulate the heart and make
  you wish that small children didn't have to endure such
  horrors.</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">My first favorite television series was
  "Twelve O'Clock High" and I had at least two models of the
  "Memphis Belle" when I was kid, all of which simply reflects the
  fact that the B-17 Flying Fortress is my favorite airplane. When
  I was a kid my family was driving through California and there
  was a B-17 parked out on somebody's front lawn on a ranch and for
  years I tried to figure out how to go back and see it. A couple
  of decades later one of the few B-17s still flying came to the
  Zenith City and I finally got to go inside one (this big bombers
  are a lot smaller than I ever thought). For all I know that
  particular B-17 ended up flying in the 1990 film "Memphis Belle."
  When I had occasion to drive through the city of Memphis, of
  course I made a point of visiting Mud Island where the "Memphis
  Belle" was on display (she was moved to the Air Force Museum in
  Dayton, Ohio this October). The "Memphis Belle" (Serial No.
  41-24485) was one of 12,750 B-17 Flying Fortresses built by the
  Boeing Aircraft Company, but it was the most famous because it
  was the first heavy bomber to complete 25 combat missions over
  Hitler's Europe without losing a crew member. The idea of 25
  missions and going home was established by the bomber command as
  an incentive for air crews because morale was desperately low
  after the first three months of American combat flights over
  Europe during which eighty percent of the planes were shot down.
  The "Belle" flew from November 7, 1942 to May 17, 1943 and its
  final flight is the fanciful subject of this film directed by
  Michael Caton-Jones ("Scandal") from the script by Monte Merrick
  ("Staying Together"). That simply means that besides the fact
  that the "Memphis Belle" was named for a lady friend (Margaret
  Polk) of the pilot and that the art on the nose depicting the
  same (designed by the famous artist George Petty) there is
  nothing here that is historically accurate when it comes to that
  final mission, which was over Lorient, France and not Bremen,
  Germany (the "Belle" flew there on its 21st mission). The names
  of the crew are all changed and I think the same applies to the
  plane's mascot, a Scotty Dog named "Stuka." So if you want
  something closer to the "true" story of the pilot Robert Morgan
  and the "Memphis Belle" you want to check out William Wyler's
  1944 documentary "The Memphis Belle: A Story of a Flying
  Fortress." What you have here instead is a Hollywood movie that
  celebrates the men who flew these bombers in World War II by
  incorporating a wide variety of clich&#239;&#191;&#189;s from war
  movies involving airplanes. Then there is the whole idea that
  Americans from all walks of life who have little in common
  besides a desire to get home alive band together to fight the
  Nazis. So it is we have the young and recognizable faces of
  Matthew Modine as the business like pilot, Eric Stoltz as the
  poetic radio operator, Tate Donovan as the co-pilot who wants to
  actually do something before he goes home, D.B. Sweeney as the
  navigator who is convinced his number is up, Billy Zane as the
  bombardier who left medical school to fight, Sean Austin as the
  runt who is stuck in the ball turret, Reed Edward Diamond as the
  flight engineer, Courtney Gains and Neil Giuntoli as the
  bickering waist gunners, and Harry Connick as tail gunner and
  sometime crooner. Back at the base David Strathairn plays the
  commanding officer nervous about his boys getting back alive and
  John Lithgow is the public relations officer the Army has sent to
  celebrate the final mission of the "Belle." Of course, it is hard
  to create tension given that most viewers know the "Memphis
  Belle" is remembered for completing that final mission, so any
  tension that is created tends to be somewhat artificial although
  there are some nice moments during the bomb run (the film might
  play better if it simply inspired by the "Belle" and they changed
  the name of the aircraft as well) . But even if the "Belle"
  survives there are other several B-17 crews on the mission who
  will not. Still, the idea that doing your duty could not just be
  dangerous but be outright suicidal is communicated, allowing
  Modine's character to explain the job to his nervous crew and
  underscore that Americans do not believe in collateral damage.
  But what will probably stand out in this film is the grim lesson
  that Donovan's character learns when he tries to be a hero by
  doing somebody else's job.</Text>

  <Text category="dvd">I thank the creators of this film which took
  me back to the days of growing up in Detroit. All the time time I
  was learning every new Motown song and every new dance step to go
  with the newest hits, I had no knowledge of the Funk Brothers. I
  grew up on Detroit's "North End" and a lot of the Motown stars
  came from this area. I connected to the film immediately when it
  opened to snow-covered English tudor homes on Detroit's Northwest
  side. The film has wonderful themes: fame, success, heartbreak,
  the beauty of friendship among musicians, failure to be
  recognized, recognition much too late, and attempts of
  redemption, if not apology. I think the whole city of Detroit, or
  at least my part of it, was heartbroken with the news that Motown
  was moving to Los Angeles. In the film the musicians are given
  their due, a la their Cubano brothers and sisters in "Buena Vista
  Social Club.</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">This is one of the best (if not THE best)
  pure screwball comedies of the 1930's. Next to the original Thin
  Man movie, Libeled Lady is my favorite Powell/Loy effort. This
  time, the magic chemistry of that oft-paired duo is enhanced by
  the box office-drawing talents of fellow mega-stars Spencer Tracy
  and Jean Harlow. The first shot of the movie celebrates this
  happy collaboration as the four top-drawer actors merrily,
  confidently stride arm-in-arm toward the camera. The plot is
  convoluted. The Star has erroneously printed a story about
  heiress Connie Allenbury (Myrna Loy), portraying her as a
  marriage wrecker. Connie immediately files a 5 million dollar
  libel suit. Star newspaper editor Warren Haggerty (Spencer Tracy)
  counteracts by hiring on suave fellow newspaperman Bill Chandler
  (William Powell) to romance Connie and place her in a
  compromising position, thus negating the lawsuit. Haggerty
  convinces his harried, long-suffering fiancee Gladys Benton (Jean
  Harlow) to instead marry the bachelor Chandler as part of the
  scheme. Things get really tricky when Gladys falls for Chandler
  and Chandler falls for Connie, who eventually falls for Chandler.
  And Haggerty? He pretty much spends the movie just seething. Yet
  everything ends fairly well, even if there's still lingering
  confusion as to who is exactly married to whom. Libeled Lady
  boasts mix-ups and complications galore and couples matching,
  cross-matching and mismatching. Sophisticated wit blends with
  full blown physical comedy. Delicious acting is laid in by four
  stars who, throughout their film careers, never ever lost their
  prime. Powell proves again his mastery of the confused
  double-take and, along with the wry, understated Myrna Loy,
  dominates the refined repartees. And representing the more
  lowbrow couple, Tracy supplies the blue collar bluster and Harlow
  the affronted looks. Walter Connolly as Connie's angling-loving
  father is simply wonderful. The intricate storyline is easy to
  follow, thanks to the clear helmsmanship of Jack Conway. With
  this cinematic venture, Hollywood certainly offered up to the
  viewing audience its most glamorous and most urbane of stars. I
  think it's brilliant stuff</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">"QUINCEANERA" Happy Birthday??? Amos Lassen
  and Literary Pride One of the great Mexican tardyons is
  celebrated by the new movie "Quinceanera", a traditional rite of
  passage. It takes place to signify that fifteen year old girls
  enter the world of womanhood. Magdalena (Emily Rios) is preparing
  for her party when the movie opens but she has a secret--she is
  pregnant. She was raised a devout Catholic girl and the fact that
  she is "with child" shames her conservative parents and they
  retaliate by ostracizing her. Distraught by her banishment from
  her family, Magdalena turns to her Uncle Tomas (Chalo Gonzales)
  who lives with her cousin, Carlos (Jesse Garcia) in a small
  apartment in Echo Park, Los Angeles. Carlos is open with her
  about his being gay and is being wooed by a new male couple which
  has moved into the neighborhood. What results is a
  m&#239;&#191;&#189;nage a trios between Carlos and the couple,
  one a television producer and the other a British citizen. Carlos
  bonds emotionally with one of the men and the situation becomes
  sticky and it jeopardizes Magdalena's new family unit. In effect
  the movie takes a careful look at class differences and in doing
  so looks at the gay characters involved as flawed and it is
  obvious that Carlos is little more than a sexual pastime for the
  couple of upper-middle class men. What results is a highly
  emotional drama that we do not see often in American films but
  that foreign films seem to have a knack for dealing with.
  Performances are excellent in the film and the directors Richard
  Glatzner and Wash Westmoreland give us a fresh new look on the
  gay cinema screen. Emily Rios is a charismatic young actress of
  whom we shall undoubtedly hear more and Chalo Gonzalez as Uncle
  Tomas gives a performance not easily forgotten. He is warm and
  laden with emotion that glows in his portrayal. Everything about
  this movie is fine, the script, the actors, the photography and
  the open description of sexuality as well as the sincerity and
  the love with which it was made. Awarded several prizes such as
  the dramatic audience and jury prizes at the 2006 Sundance
  Festival, "Quinceanera" is a marvelous film--especially because
  it wears its queerness so well, the gay it balances both gay and
  straight story lines and the way it deals with such important
  issues as sexuality, maturation, culture clashes and love. Simply
  put this is an amazing film and should not be missed.</Text>

  <Text category="dvd">This is one of the best movies starring
  children I have ever seen - Ozu embraces their viewpoint - often
  litterally from their eye level. Often in other Ozu films like
  'Tokyo Story', and 'Early Summer' - we would see flashes of
  children from a strikingly noncondescending and, often times,
  humerous perspective. Now in 'Good Morning' we have an almost
  entire film devoted to childhood - and events that are important
  in the lives of these kids and their parents and family. Like all
  Ozu films it is gorgeously shot and in a bright colorful style
  full of wonderfull compositions. It is not as masterul as 'Tokyo
  Story' of 'Floating Weeds' - but it gives us a better
  understanding of Ozu and how he saw the world - very charming
  film</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">Though this movie is not the stage version,

  off to Paris, and Ted for London. Well Bill discovers a

  <Text category="dvd">Screenwriter Charlie Kaufman's
  reality-bending work has become such a Hollywood staple that he
  is becoming more distinctive than the directors who give life to
  his wildly imaginative and solipsistic scripts. He dares to give
  dramatic form to nebulous psychological states that border on
  horror stories. Directed by Michel Gondry, this 2004 study in
  love and loss is no exception, as Kaufman takes the notion of a
  struggling relationship and inverts it into a manic piece of
  science fiction involving a medical procedure to scrub one's
  memory. At the same time, Gondry and Kaufman have injected a
  strong dose of humanism into this film by grounding it with
  characters that are relatable as much as they are quirky. The
  labyrinth plot focuses on shy, taciturn Joel Barish, who is swept
  off his feet by the raucous, unstable Clementine. Much to his
  dismay after a particularly ugly fight, he discovers that
  Clementine has impulsively decided to erase all memory of her
  relationship with him through a medical company called Lacuna
  headed by the benevolent Dr. Mierzwiak. A renowned leader in his
  field of memory erasure, Mierzwiak treats the heartbroken Joel to
  the same procedure as Clementine's. However, Joel is overcome by
  the intensity of emotion from this act of reciprocation and
  starts rebelling against the deep consciousness treatment to
  regain his memories of Clementine. The surreal twists and turns
  that occur boggle the mind of the viewer but not in a way that
  alienates us from Joel's plight. It helps that a sturdy cast has
  been recruited starting with a surprisingly subdued Jim Carrey as
  the depressed Joel. This is easily his most effective attempt at
  a straight dramatic role even though Gondry allows him to provide
  flashes of his manic personality when appropriate. Displaying no
  trace of her corseted Britishness as the bedraggled free spirit
  Clementine, Kate Winslet shows the right level of abandon and
  leavens it with her natural earthiness. Tom Wilkinson is his
  usual steady self as the somewhat remorseful Mierzwiak, while his
  spirited trio of assistants is played with relish by Kirsten
  Dunst, Mark Ruffalo and Elijah Wood. All three are fine with
  Dunst particularly affecting toward the end. The looping
  narrative could have spiraled out of control had it not been for
  the stellar work by cinematographer Ellen Kuras, production
  designer Dan Leigh and editor Valdis Oskarsdottir, all combining
  to bring much-needed fluidity to initially incoherent scenes. The
  only fly in the ointment is Jon Brion's overly intrusive music.
  The 2004 DVD has several extras, the best of which is the
  consistently informative commentary track by Gondry and Kaufman,
  which helps explain some of the more bizarre plot turns. There
  are two featurettes - a standard ten-minute making-of short and a
  fifteen-minute conversation with Gondry and Carrey that borders
  on banal. Seven minutes of understandably excised scenes are
  included, as well as a creative music video of The Polyphonic
  Spree's "Night and Day" and a faux-commercial for Lacuna</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">Truth be told, I should probably give this
  film only four stars because it does take a while to really get
  going and I think some of the story elements could have been
  presented more effectively. When this thing gets going, though,
  The Descent easily attains not-to-be-missed status, and on top of
  all the incredible special effects, oppressive atmosphere, and
  grievous bloodletting (made with a pretty limited budget, by the
  way), one of the most important plot points of the story is
  actually brought home in an impressively subtle manner. Are you
  kidding me? Blood, gore, a claustrophobic atmosphere like you
  wouldn't believe - and subtlety? How could I not give The Descent
  five stars? So you've got these young British women who like to
  get together once a year and engage in some sort of risky,
  extreme activity. White water rafting, for example. Everyone has
  fun, but then a horrible automobile accident changes the life of
  one of the women, Sarah (Shauna MacDonald), forever. Still
  recovering from her terrible loss, Sarah joins her friend Beth
  (Alex Reid) in America, where mutual friend Juno (Natalie
  Mendoza), an Alpha Female if there ever was one, has staked out a
  cave system just begging to be explored. Joining in the fun are
  Holly (Nora-Jane Noone), Juno's new gung-ho sidekick, and a
  couple of sisters who round out the spelunking sextet. The movie
  drags a good bit as we sit and watch the girls arrive at their
  destination in the Appalachians (apparently somewhere in the
  North Carolina mountains - although the movie was filmed entirely
  in the UK), then do their bonding thing the night before the big
  adventure. Once they descend into the cave system, though, things
  start getting more intense fairly quickly. Their first real move
  down into the complex of cave structures turns into quite a tight
  and claustrophobic ordeal, especially for Sarah who gets stuck
  and is barely pulled to safety before the tunnel collapses.
  That's when Juno, a woman with more than her fair share of
  secrets, admits that she has led the girls into a cave system
  that has never been explored before, supposedly to help reunite
  the group. Well, it does just the opposite, but they just have to
  keep going. If there is a way out, they're going to have to find
  it the hard way. Things are already creepy enough at this point.
  The filmmakers did an incredible job with the sets, making the
  viewer feel as if he/she is trapped in a real cave system with
  the characters. Just watching these girls pull their bodies
  through extremely tight, dark spaces was enough to get me feeling
  pretty darn claustrophobic. But the real fun was just about to
  begin. In the wake of one of the most realistic compound leg
  fracture scenes you'll ever want to squirm through, Sarah spots
  the presence of someone or something else down there with them.
  No one believes her - at first. When the "crawlers" attack,
  though, all hell breaks loose two miles under ground. These
  Gollum-like creatures are some kind of blind, albino humanoids
  who hunt by sound, can scamper and climb like monkeys, move
  unbelievably quickly, and really tear into whatever flesh they
  can find. Not only are they frighteningly impressive in and of
  themselves, the filmmakers present them in the most effective of
  cinematic light. And when the girls fight back, it's cinematic
  magic as the filmmakers hold nothing back in the creepy, bloody,
  gruesome department. And even as characters are fighting for
  their lives, a personal bombshell or two also drops to ratchet up
  the frenetic drama level even higher. The ending is a little
  controversial because American theatrical audiences didn't get to
  see the true final scene of the film, for some pretty
  questionable reasons. A few seconds can and do make a pretty big
  difference. Don't worry, though, as the DVD has both endings
  available. The Descent draws deeply from the well of man's most
  instinctual fears, making it one of the most atmospheric,
  heart-pounding movies to come along in quite a while. The
  subtlety of the story in terms of the relationship between Sarah
  and Juno is almost as impressive as the cinematography and sound
  work - and it even leaves room for an alternate explanation of
  everything that happens here. The Descent has everything you
  could ever ask for in a horror film - and plenty more on top of
  that. If you care the first thing about horror, you must see this
  atmospheric tour de force</Text>

  <Text category="dvd">This would be a steal at twice the price. I
  don't know what possessed Spike Lee to offer five of his best
  movies at such a low price. Do the Right Thing is a brilliant
  movie, capturing both the rhythms and tensions of Lee's beloved
  Brooklyn, which he would return to time and again. Lee is at his
  best when avoiding the polemics and sticking to character-driven
  movies. Jungle Fever and Mo' Better Blues stand out in this
  regard, because they are first and foremost about people. Jungle
  Fever introduced the great Samuel L. Jackson, as well as launched
  Wesley Snipes in an intense social drama which revolves around an
  inter-racial love affair. Jackson stole most of the scenes
  however as the drug-addled brother who simply couldn't get his
  act straight no matter how hard he tried. Mo' Better Blues
  exposed Lee's love for jazz. Moody and atmospheric, with Denzel
  Washington delivering a solid performance, the film tries to
  recapture the spirit of the Harlem Renaissance. Clockers was his
  crime drama with plenty of tension. Crooklyn revolved mostly
  around amusing family disputes, with Alfre Woodard as a strong
  mother figure. It was probably the least satisfying of the five,
  but fun to watch just the same. Lee embelishes his movies with
  such rich cinematic color, and offers numerous fascinating camera
  angles such as his now famous walking scenes in Jungle Fever. Not
  since Gordon Parks, had someone done so much for black cinema,
  rescuing it from the blaxploitation films of the 70's</Text>

  <Text category="dvd">This movie is all about entertaining.The
  combination between "Die Hard" and typical martial arts flick
  works in many levels, but the production values are Hong Kong`s,
  don`t miss that point.Fans of Jet Li are welcome, but action fans
  be careful. Here we can find scale helicopters burst in flames,
  exploding building models, chopped off dummies, you name it. The
  characters are extreme in their own context: Jet Li is a former
  military now becomed bodygard and stunt actor, loyal, gentleman,
  honorable, deadly, you know, a portrait of the typical good guy.
  The bad guys are also extremely violent and cool looking. He
  doesn't fight or kick much in this film, but he shoots a lot,
  dodging bullets from a dozen bad guys with machine guns with no
  scratch at all, his revolver shoots 30 bullets without reloading,
  he drives a car inside a hall and uses the elevator, that happens
  to be be the right size... Well, you have to be in the right mood
  to watch this film without laughing at the many cartoonish
  production mistakes. But if you are into Hong Kong low production
  values action films, you will really enjoy one of the best ones
  of the 90`s. By the way, this DVD edition sucks. English dubbed,

  opposite Keanu Reeves and all hell breaks loose with both of them
  recklessly driving commercial buses. In the twelve years since

  <Text category="dvd">This is an O.K movie. I give it a 3.5. It
  starts out with the origin of Mewtwo, as using DNA from the
  legendary Pokemon Mew's eyebrow fossil to create a clone, Mewtwo.
  Soon, Team Rocket leader Giovanni tries to control Mewtwo after
  he destroys the lab from which he was born in, but Mewtwo has
  other plans, thinking his purpose is not to serve humans. So he
  invites the most powerful Pokemon trainers to the New Island to
  see who can stand up to him. But things get outta control when
  Mewtwo steals all the Pokemon in black Pokeballs and creates
  artificial "Super-Clones" to prove that clones are the strongest
  in the universe. But he didn't count on Ash, a young Pokemon
  Trainer. Ash destroys the cloning machine, thus bringing Mew to
  the scene and saving the captured Pokemon. Who'll win? The
  superclones or the originals? Mew or Mewtwo? You've got to see it
  to beleive it</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">I have very fond memories of this short
  lived Irwin Allen classic.The picture and sound on the dvd's is
  better than i remember.The video transfer is very nice and the
  sound is crisp albeit in mono.I give volume one of the "Time
  Tunnel" five stars for pure television enjoyment.Volume one
  contains the first 15 episodes of the show,The unaired extended
  version of the pilot,Irwin Allen's behind the scenes home movies,
  visual effects,camera test,still galleries and promotional tv and
  radio spots.Once again it is lacking in cast interviews. many of
  the actors from this show are still alive,so why didn't the
  studio interview them for the dvd set?.It would be a welcomed
  addition to any release to see the actors today and get their
  thought's on the show.My only gripe is that this show only ran
  for one season,so why split it into two volumes?.Surely the
  studio could have compiled all 30 episodes into one boxed set at
  a reasonable price</Text>

  <Text category="dvd">English humor is famous for it's

  you need the English pedigree to really like it. The Young ones

  <Text category="dvd">In the days of the Arcades there was a good
  movie that came out (and funny enough had a great Arcade game)
  called Krull. Now mind you, I really had no idea what this movie
  was all about before i saw it (when i was a whole bunch younger)
  just saw the 5 bladed "glaive" and was sold but now as an adult i
  find i still like this movie and it reminds me of a true dungeons
  and dragons style adventure then almost any other movie
  (including those terrible scifi D&amp;amp;D movies ugh) it starts
  off with a prince and of course a princess yes been done before
  many many times but then in come the Slayers and from then on its
  a totally different experience. with such ultimate favorites as
  the Emerald Seer, The Widow of the Web and the Cyclops and of
  course the shapeshifting (a bit daft too) wizard with some very
  strange habits (i dare not tell you so as not to ruin it) but
  this is a classic movie and it will be good for generations to
  come. Pros: cool effects (for the time) good story well done plot
  and themes cons: may be a bit too old for some and not flashy
  enough. but remember it is a tad old. its a 5 star easily some
  may not agree but judge the movie on its merits and not against
  those of today and anyone can see the care and detail that made
  this movie great</Text>

  produced.Be it in the scenario as well as the performance of an
  actress in the part. So many came before and so many after
  Elizabeth Taylor however to me Cleopatra will always be Elizabeth

  classic in historic movies.If you are history lover you should
  have this movie in your collection</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">PRO + Great story, teriffic acting,
  beautiful setting CON - Some pacing flaws, but not enough to
  destroy the whole Lindsay Duncan is perfectly cast as the
  guardian of this endangered photographic archive and Liam
  Cunningham is her well-cast, perfunctory foil. As as the story
  unfolds, the differences between British and American style (and
  culture) are revealed, providing a nice subtext to the plot. One
  of the viewing pleasures is in discovering that not everything is
  as it appears, from the central story to the character's lives.
  Good actors all. But my "best actor" award goes to the
  photographs themselves: the stories they tell and the feelings
  they evoke are haunting and captivating all at once. A visually
  rich film</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">Loved them all ... found Victoria
  &amp;amp;amp; Albert and Lorna Doone a bit lacking. Wondered
  about having more of The Scarlet Pimpernel offered - he's so
  smooth! Tom Jones is very special - loved Sophie's father, he
  truly made the film. As much as I liked him - hated Lizzie's
  mother in P &amp;amp;amp; P - what a ninny! This is a great

  <Text category="dvd">My 2 year old loves his video. The
  animations are unusual but they are full of flare, color and
  imagination. The songs they include are by far the best part and
  my daughter can't get enough of them. The main character
  Moustache, and the rest of the characters, are all well imagined
  and fun. As far as the learning experience my daughter loves to
  repeat the phrases and sing the songs and I see her using what
  she has learned all the time, and the semi-interactive format
  they use really gets her involved in the story line. I personally
  love this video and would recommend it</Text>

  <Text category="dvd">This disk collects the two Tales From the
  Crypt movies on one side of a single disk. For some reason the
  menu has the second movie listed first. In the first movie, Billy
  Zane is excellent as a demon looking for a final key so that the
  demons can retake the universe. This is the story of his battle
  with the current Demon Knight, the protector of the key.
  Wonderfully crafted and dark. The second movie, Bordello of
  Blood, is a more tongue-in-cheek T&amp;amp;A-fest and lacks the
  dark seriousness of the first. Lilith, the queen of all vampires,
  has been awakened. She can be controlled by a key (the one from
  the first movie). She has set up a bordello to lure victims to
  her hunger. Dennis Miller is his wise-cracking self as he
  portrays a down-and-out private investigator looking for a
  missing person. It is nice not to have to flip the disk over or
  insert a new disk but there is no room for real extras (we do get
  the original trailers). Seeing the two films together really
  showcases the extreme difference between the two. The first is
  dark, well-written and well-acted. The second is gratuitous,
  crass and just not quite as good (although it is fun in its own
  way). Now they are together at a reasonable price.</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">This is a beautifully orchestrated tale
  about the delightful absurdity in all human endeavor. It is also
  a story of cross-cultural misunderstanding of the highest order.
  Kinsky was a madman in the film and in real life and therefore
  perfect for the part. The scene of the steam ship spinning out of
  control in that waterfall is one of the memorable in the history
  of the cinema. The cinematography and editing are a masterpiece.

  <Text category="dvd">'Fais-moi des vacances' (WE NEED A VACATION)
  is a finely wrought little film that studies the disparities
  between the classes in France while introducing us to a warmly
  tender and humorous friendship between two young lads. Directed
  and written by Didier Bivel (with writing assistance from Djamila
  Djabri) it offers a slice of life we rarely see - that underbelly
  of France's projects where mixed races strive to exist without
  the amenities of those with means who surround their
  neighborhoods. Lucien (Aymen Sa&#239;&#191;&#189;di) lives with
  his father (Bernard Blancan), mother (Hiam Abbass), young sister
  Pamela (Laura Mas Navarro), and his tough streetwise older
  brother Jos&#239;&#191;&#189; (Nabil El Bouhairi) in a small
  flat. Close by is his African friend Adama (Ibrahim Koma) and his
  equally poor family of father (Makan Fofana), mother
  (Marie-Philom&#239;&#191;&#189;ne Nga) and sister Fanta (Hawa
  Yakar&#239;&#191;&#189; Sissoko). As school ends the kids whose
  families have money take them on a vacation, a state neither
  Lucien nor Adama can afford despite their obsession with that
  luxury. The two boys manipulate funds and ideas and ultimately
  come up with the idea of secretly jumping aboard a RUV of a
  family headed for the beach. BUT despite the success of their
  plan and the encouragement of the daughter of the van's owners,
  the boys end up not at the beach but at a nudist camp, a fact
  that makes them flee! Upon returning home both boys' families
  punish their activities and when Lucien seeks comfort from his
  older brother, Jos&#239;&#191;&#189; beats him and tells him to
  grow up. In the end the boys finagle their way to the beach, but
  of course by this time vacation time is over and they are on an
  empty beach re-evaluating their lives. The cast is uniformly
  strong, the writing is excellent, and the camera work not only
  captures the claustrophobia of the projects but also opens up the
  vistas of the boys' imaginations. It is a fine little film, one
  deserving of a wide audience. Grady Harp, January 07</Text>

  <Text category="dvd">This one is an old favorite of mine, which I
  pre-ordered on DVD the instant I learned it was available. I have
  an old VHS recording of the film, which I have viewed many times.
  I have also read the book many times, and I consider it to be
  Conroy's best work. This is the story of four young men at
  Carolina Military Institute, a fictional military academy located
  in South Carolina, which is of course a pseudonym for The
  Citadel, which is a fine military academy that really does exist.
  The film is set in the 1960s. The first black cadet (first year
  cadets are called "knobs" at the Institute) has just arrived. A
  secret society within the Institute, known as "The Ten" has
  pledged that no black will ever graduate from the Institute,
  regardless of ability. David Keith turns in his customary
  excellent performance as the black cadet's designated mentor. The
  plot moves at a fast pace, but nevertheless does not feel rushed.
  Purists have criticized the fact that the film leaves out many
  sub-plots contained in the novel. I feel that the movie made the
  right choices about what to keep and what to delete, and of
  course these choices had to be made unless this was to be a 12
  hour miniseries. I liked the script, the acting, and the ending.
  This is a wonderful film. It is the type of film that most
  viewers will watch periodically over the years, and I am
  delighted that it will shortly be available on DVD.</Text>

  <Text category="dvd">This movie is truly wonderfully done. I
  appreciate the lightheartedness of the characters, and the deep
  resonances of director Zhang Yimou's commentary on academics in
  modern rural China. The language is particularly good for
  students learning Mandarin Chinese, as it shows an excellent
  example of the differences between spoken Chinese in the
  countryside and in the cities. There are English subtitles for
  beginners as well. I highly recommend it.</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">The economy, austerity and directness of the
  films of Fritz Lang made him one of the most profound, and
  precise filmmakers... Lang, a master of the German expressionist
  film, shot his first talkie, a crime drama considered a landmark
  in the story of suspense movies... It was a shocking idea for its
  time, based on the real-life killer Peter Kurten, headlined as
  the Vampire of D&#239;&#191;&#189;sseldorf... 'M' is about a
  terrorized city, and a plump little man with wide eyes (often
  chewing candy) who is a pathological child-killer, unable to
  control his urge for killing... The film embodies several Lang
  themes: the duality between justice and revenge, mob hysteria,
  the menacing anticipation of watching a helplessly trapped
  individual trying fruitlessly to escape as greater forces move
  inexorably in, and, for probably the first time in the cinema, it
  adds a new dimension to suspense: pity... For the killer is
  clearly mentally sick... He cannot overcome the overwhelming
  compulsion of his murderous disease, and yet, we see him hunted
  down and almost lynched as a criminal, rather than treated as a
  sick man... Early in the film, the killer is heard whistling the
  Grieg theme from 'In the Hall of the Mountain King'. This theme
  inexorably becomes imbued with menace... And when we see no more
  than a girl looking in a shop window, the melody on the
  sound-track told us chillingly that the murderer is there, just
  out of sight... The Murderer is played by Peter Lorre in a
  virtuoso performance that has barely been matched in all the
  thrillers he has made since 'Casablanca,' 'The Maltese Falcon,'
  and 'The Mask of Dimitrios.' When the photographs of his victims,
  all little girls, are shown to him, he jumps back and twitches
  with horror... With powerful visuals, Lang's motion picture is
  Lorre's first film... His performance as the corpulent, hunted
  psychopath is a masterpiece of mime and suggestion... Lorre is
  the archetypal outsider-outside the law and society because of
  his compulsive crimes, outside the balancing society of the
  underworld because he is not a professional criminal... He had
  only twelve lines of dialog... In the most famous of all about a
  pathological killer - Alfred Hitchcock's 'Psycho' - Anthony
  Perkins lacked not only the threat of the tortured Peter Lorre,
  but also the dimension of invoking our incredulous sympathy...
  'Psycho' reeked with blood and horror, whereas the suspense of
  'M' is subtle... A child's balloon without an owner, a rolling
  ball, are enough to tell us that another murder had been
  committed... The audience, trapped in its seats, torn by
  ambivalent feelings towards the killer, watched him trapped as
  the net is pulled tight...</Text>

  <Text category="dvd">Asks the interviewer, "What place would you
  give Shoot the Piano Player in relation to your other films?"
  Answers director Fran&#239;&#191;&#189;ois Truffaut, "No place.
  Simply the second film I made." Considering his first feature
  film was The Four Hundred Blows and his third was Jules et Jim,
  Truffaut's matter-of-factness and lack of pretense is worth a
  smile. Shoot the Piano Player is worth smiles, too. It's a clever
  film, playful at times, even funny. More than anything, however,
  it defies categorization. The movie is a strange and successful
  amalgamation of crime and comedy, suspense and inevitability,
  tragedy and love, and gangsters, girl friends and violence. It's
  the story of Charlie Koller (Charles Aznavour), a piano player in
  a Paris dive, who used to be Eduoard Saroyan, a famous pianist,
  whose wife committed suicide. Truffaut says the movie is a film
  about a shy man. Charlie is the kind of shy man who cannot bring
  himself to touch the hand of a woman he wants. He can't go back
  and open the door to the room where he left his wife sobbing. He
  thinks about what he should do, but can't do it, and then
  circumstances take over. Charlie, thanks to his brothers, finds
  himself in a gangland underworld where double-crossing is going
  to lead to a shootout in the snow. Some say Shoot the Piano
  Player is an homage to American gangster films. Perhaps it is,
  but I challenge anyone to spend much time considering this
  possibility while watching the movie. The film is original,
  funny, moving and sad. It's the kind of film that people who love
  movies write essays about. All I know is that I was moved by
  Charlie. We leave him where we met him, playing piano in a Paris
  dive. Charles Aznavour, a diminutive man with a hangdog look,
  plays Charlie perfectly. Aznavour is probably better known in the
  U. S. as a singer, but in France he's seen as both an actor and a
  singer. He's a minimalist, he says about himself. Charlie thinks
  too much and does too little. Aznavour lets us see into Charlie's
  soul with few words. It's a marvelous performance that left me
  saddened by Charlie, but liking him. The Criterion DVD transfer
  is first-rate. Criterion gives us two discs. The first has the
  movie and a commentary track. The second disc contains interviews
  by Aznavour and Marie Dubois, who played Charlie's girlfriend,
  Lena, plus excerpts from documentaries featuring Truffaut, and
  other extras. The Criterion case contains a 28 page booklet with
  substantial material on the film and Truffaut</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">To Be or Not To Be is a comedy set during
  WWII. Although it makes light of a tense time in history, it
  manages to maintain an air of respect and mischief to keep the
  viewer at ease. The story revolves around two actors in Poland,
  Maria and Joseph Tura. Joseph (Jack Benny) specializes in
  overplaying Hamlet and Maria (Carole Lombard) specializes in
  seducing younger men in her dressing room as her husband begins
  his "To be or not to be" speech. The man she seduces is a soldier
  who draws her into a dangerous spy situation. Although she is
  working for the Allies, a Nazi leader attempts to make her a spy
  for his cause. Madcap comedy ensues as the actors attempt to get
  them out of the mess. The film is very funny thanks to the
  brilliant dialogue and acting. It is a real shame that Carole
  Lombard died after this film was made in a plane crash; she
  proves to be a very beautiful and talented comedienne.</Text>

  <Text category="dvd">The magnificent frame employment, accent
  even more the claustrophobic atmosphere about a man in an unnamed

  Perkins' emotive memory after Psycho fit with adjusted accuracy.
  A magnificent cast headed by Jeanne Moreau, Akim Tamirof, Elsa
  Martinelli and Welles too. A fundamental icon of the
  cinematography. Footnote: It should be known that a special
  request of Welles around a documental that included at least some
  shots of the Atomic Bomb were totally denied to him. Something
  similar happened with Kubrick when he asked for flight sequences
  of the B-52 IN Dr. Strangelove.</Text>

  <Text category="dvd">The movie starts out with our hero, Izo,
  being gruesomly crucified. Because of his rage towards the ones
  who crucified him, he travels through time to present day to
  wreak his vengence on them. Then a bunch of stuff happens that
  has no relevance to the plot really, including: having sex with
  mother nature, a woman pulling a sword out of her vagina then izo
  throwing a rock at her face, being killed several times, a very
  trippy scene where he is sucked underwater and comes up on the
  other side of some wedding where he kills the groom and bride
  then is sucked back, killing little children, killing a group of
  mothers in the hallway, vampires, being attacked by a swat team,
  and a random guy singing while playing an out of tune guitar.
  While he does all this he turns into a demon then finally kills
  the ones that were responsible for his crucifixion. This movie
  gets 5 stars because it is so random and has made me mentally
  insane since watching it and other japanese films like it</Text>

  inarticulate with poor social skills. However he becomes a threat
  to the Matriarch of the town by the name of Aunty EmTeeVee (or

  <Text category="dvd">I'm the first to confess that I had never
  heard any of any of the actors starring in the 1951 Robert Wise
  gothic noir, The House on Telegraph Hill, but it doesn't matter,
  because all the actors are good, and combined with an extremely
  effective plot, the movie is a terrific tale of murder, deceit
  and assumed identities in post world war San Francisco. As was
  the fashion with many noir films of the time, The House on
  Telegraph Hill is told in flashback with a voice over from the
  heroine. She tells of her house that is empty and is up for sale,
  and one immediately assumes that something terrible has happened.
  However, the narrative soon jumps to Germany at the end of the
  War, and we meet Victoria Kopwelska (Valentina Cortese) is a
  Polish woman imprisoned in Belsen. With her husband and family
  dead, Victoria tells the kindly American commander Major Marc
  Bennett (William Lundigan) that there's nothing for her back in
  Poland. Desperate to survive, Victoria learns that her best
  friend has family in the United States, and if they are ever
  freed, she promises to take Victoria to America with her. Her
  friend however, is killed shortly before American troops can
  liberate the camp. With nowhere to go, Victoria hatches a scheme
  to steal her friend's papers and sail to America, where she
  learns now the godmother to a young boy Chris (Gordon Gebert), as
  well as the heir to a sizable fortune, and a gorgeously gothic
  house high atop Telegraph Hill, following the death of her
  "aunt." Ensconced in the ostensible mansion, Victoria, now
  dressing in glamorous frocks and drinking expensive champagne
  marries the boy's guardian Alan Spender (Richard Basehart),
  partly out of desperation and partly out of the need for
  security. As Victoria becomes a "mother" to the boy, she clashes
  with his governess Margaret (Fay Baker) and coincidently
  reconnects with Marc whom she met a Belsen, now a studly a
  playboy type lawyer. All the adults are not as they seem: Marc
  has been making secret plans to get his hands on the money, and
  Victoria's arrival causes him to draft a new scheme. Victoria
  begins to believe that her new sweetheart is up to no good. And
  then there's the Margaret, the furtive outsider and whether her
  allegiances to Chris are all they seem. The film is compelling,
  and tension-fuelled and beautifully shot in black and white.
  Cortese is especially good in one of her first American roles and
  as Victoria, she frantically tries to keep up her masquerade, yet
  through no fault of her own, she steadily becomes a victim of
  Alan's scheming. Of particular note are the stunning location
  shots of San Francisco. The main house is just beautiful and the
  scenes when Victoria is playing baseball with Chris offer
  stunning views of San Francisco Bay. The House on Telegraph Hill
  ultimately serves as one of the better noir thrillers - there's a
  runaway car, poisoned orange juice, an enigmatic and jealous
  housekeeper and a false identity. It all makes for a gripping and
  entertaining film. Victoria starts out as a victim, and although
  she schemes and lies her way into the house on Telegraph Hill,
  her ability to rise above the nefarious misdeeds enable her to
  achieve a kind of redemption for both her and Chris. Mike Leonard

  <Text category="dvd">200 American is actually quite pleasantly
  romantic gay comedy. Even though it looks like a no-budget
  episode of Queer As Folk or intended to be a gay version of
  Pretty Woman, it's got a pretty good story. It doesn't rely on
  fancy production and lighting or cinematography. Most of the
  actors are straight playing gay roles. I was surprised to learn
  from the special features material that the entire cast and crew
  volunteer for this show, something that I can certainly relate
  to. The acting is acceptable but not great, because most of the
  actors are not that experienced. I was surprised that there was
  no production and wardrobe designer! The movie has some kind of
  charm about it, perhaps it's because it's so sincere and gimmick
  free, and even the love scenes are very low-key. I was very
  touched by the romantic plotline between the hustler and his new
  boss. There is something about a straight guy doing love scene
  with another male actor, it's very captivating. Sean Matic did a
  good job with his light Austrilian accent by the way. It's worth
  rental fee for sure.</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">This is an adorable movie. It's low-budget
  and the acting is not spectacular, but nevertheless, it's a cute
  story with sexy characters and an impressive, unique plot. Conrad
  is a successful, attractive man recently heart-broken. Venturing
  into the unknown, he hires a sex worker for the night. As it
  turns out, his hired man, Ian, is quite the catch -- a young,
  charming, sexy Australian trying to save money to stay in the
  country. Soon enough, Ian is in Conrad's life every day, though
  not as you may think. As Ian moves into Conrad's social life,
  everyone's issues come to the surface. Love stories unfold and
  redevelop, problems at home collide with life at work, the truth
  behind Ian's need to do sex work comes out, and everyone is in
  for a wake-up call about life and what they need. Basically, it's
  genuine, it's cute and charming, and it deals with real-life
  problems, most of which just happen to be gay, a definite plus in
  my book. So give its budget a break and sit back and enjoy a film
  well-worth seeing.</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">I first saw this movie around 1980, when the
  Cold War was still on. I had been inundated with propaganda from
  birth, that all Russians talked about was political, that they
  didn't do "normal" things or live a normal life. All politics you
  know. Well, here was this movie about the lives and loves of
  three women. It was very well acted, and basically, just a long
  soap! I loved it--and not one word about Lenin, Marx, or
  anti-Americanisms. I recently saw it again, and liked it just as
  much. For those who say it is unrealistic--well, how do you know?
  Do you think that all Russians lived the exact same life? Or
  because American Cold War propaganda stated that all Russians
  were totally miserable</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">John Sturges acquires a reputation as a
  solid director of superior Westerns filled with tense action
  scenes such as: "Escape From Fort Bravo," "Bad Day at Black
  Rock," "Backlash," "Gunfight At The O.K. Corral," "The Law and
  Jack Wade," "The Last Train From Gun Hill," "Sergeant Three,"
  "The Hallelujah Trail," and one of the best of all Wyatt Earp
  movies, "Hour of the Gun." He succeeds in one of the most
  exhilarating opening sequences of all Western movies, when he had
  McQueen and Brynner riding a hearse up legendary Boot Hill
  creating a mood and peril that never allow the slightest degree
  of viewer confusion or ennui... For Sturges, the West is a man's
  world, and his cool, hard, detached style, emphasizing action,
  excitement and the rugged environment of the frontier, endorses
  the point... "The Magnificent Seven" is derived from Kurosawa's
  superb "The Seven Samurai," a compelling tale of intimidated and
  impoverished medieval villagers hiring mercenary warriors to
  repel bandit ravages... The villagers in this case are Mexicans,
  plagued beyond all bearing by the activities of bandit Calavera,
  who always leaves them on tortillas and few beans... Three of
  them cross the border to offer meager pay and sustenance for any
  professionally skilled fighting men who will aid them... Yul
  Brynner is the man, dressed in black, with the luminous dome and
  the hypnotic Mongolian eyes who portrays the distinctive Chris
  Adams leader of the seven hired gunmen hired to chase some 'flies
  from a little Mexican village.' Eli Wallach is memorable as
  Calvera, chief of the ruthless outlaws... He is greedy and
  merciless terrorizing without pity the poor peasants... Steve
  McQueen gives a standout performance as the sardonic gunman ('We
  deal in lead, friend'), carrying appealing ease and sense of
  humor to his role as Vin, Brynner's first recruit and
  second-in-command... Charles Bronson portrays Bernardo O'Reilly,
  who explains his curious name to Chris, with 'Mexican on one
  side, Irish on the other--and me in the middle!' Bronson, the
  strongest face in Western, and with a bit of Mexican in
  him--cunning face, steady eyes, revealing voice--the character of
  Bernardo O'Reilly suits him perfectly... This half-breed
  gunfighter becomes the conscience of the team... Because of his
  tender paternal instincts, he is adopted by three children who
  promise him, in case he falls, to bring him, every day, fresh
  flowers... Robert Vaughn--who was to do nicely on TV in "The Man
  from Uncle" spy spoof-- plays Lee, the 'good gun' with black
  gloves and nightmares, living in style with no enemies alive...
  Brad Dexter plays Harry Luck, Brynner's happy friend who returns
  to join the team convinced of the existence of a large amount of
  hidden gold... James Coburn makes a big impression as Britt, the
  expert gunman who can out-draw a gun with his knife-throwing...
  His looks and vague figure of violence are quite a response for
  his few talks... Horst Bucholz represents youth, eagerness, and
  the urge to be proved and sorted out from the boys... He was
  caught on the road by Rosenda Monteros... Robert J. Wilke is
  Britt's insisting challenger who swells the ranks of the villains
  in many Westerns like "High Noon," "The Far Country," and "Man of
  the West." The Magnificent Seven's success spawned three sequels:
  "Return of the Seven" (again starring Yul Brynner), "Guns of the
  Magnificent Seven" and, last and least of all, "The Magnificent
  Seven Ride." With a terrific Oscar-Nominated Musical Score by
  Elmer Bernstein, "The Magnificent Seven" remains a richly
  enjoyable Western, shot on location in Morelos state,
  Mexico...</Text>

  <Text category="dvd">Born in Steventon, Hampshire in 1775, Jane
  Austen was one of two daughters of the Reverent George Austen and
  his wife Cassandra. She was educated in Oxford and in
  Southampton, finally attending a boarding school in the Abbey
  gatehouse in Reading, Berkshire. The environment provided by her
  home was conducive to writing and she often enacted plays for her
  family, something that gave her the opportunity to present her
  stories and develop the characters in depth. Jane Austen's works
  are imaginative, full of emotion and depicting relationships that
  transcend time. Jane Austen wrote about society, about propriety
  and about etiquette. She was highly critical of the snobbery with
  which the upper classes kept away from others. Her study of human
  flaws and prsonal relationships provide great material for the
  development of her characters. Jane Austen wrote Pride and
  Prejudice in 1813 and it still enchants audiences all over the
  world. The first time I read this book, I read as a child, back
  in Cuba, "Orgullo y Prejuicio." The writings of Jane Austen
  shaped my perception of true love as I identified with the love
  between Elizabeth Bennet and her one and only, Mr. Darcy. With
  this BBC adaptation completed in 1996, I have been able to relive
  the experience of exposing myself to a classic, one of the best
  books ever written. With this BBC miniseries we feel as though we
  were reading the book, for the adaptation faithfully follows the
  author's writing. The filming is magnificent, offering us a view
  of gorgeous scenery, magnificent castles, and locations that
  bring the book to life, for we can see what we expected after
  reading the book. The love story presents the struggle of the
  times, as two individuals fall in love, regardless of class
  differences, or status, and yet, the antagonism and friction
  created as a result of said differences. Darcy is a wealthy
  single man who, upon meeting the family of Elizabeth, boisterous,
  non-polished, and simple, believes her to be beneath him. The
  meet at a dance where his best friend falls in love with
  Elizabeth sister, but Darcy thinks he knows Jane's heart not to
  be true to these emotions. Elizabeth overhears a conversation
  during the dance and feels insulted by the proud and distant
  Darcy, keeping her distance and yet, without her awareness,
  falling in love with him. Jane Austen is masterful at creating
  enough tension to keep us all in suspense as to the path these
  lives will take as some members of Elizabeth family make the
  wrong choices. The dialogue is almost verbatim to the book,
  making this series a true delight for those of us who identify
  with this work. Jennifer Ehle as Elizabeth and Colin Firth as
  Darcy provide magnificent interpretations of this timeless
  classic, keeping us all dreaming of ever encountering love of
  this magnitude in our lives. As with most DVDs that we own, we
  watch by selecting English subtitles, which enhances the viewing
  by allowing us NOT to miss a single word said by the characters.
  Who would want to miss a single word in this marvel of the
  English language? There is a documentary as an additional bonus,
  where interviews with cast members are included... simply
  awesome! Interviewed are: Jennifer Ehle [Elizabeth], Colin Firth
  [Darcy]. We also get to see those who played Mary Bennet [Lucy
  Briers], Mr. Collins [David Bamber, Mr. Bingley [Crispin
  Bonham-Carter] and Mr. Wickham [Adrian Lukis]</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">This film seems to be known worldwide as a
  "chick flick", from the romantic aspects of it, to the current
  anniversary DVD's pink cover. I'm an 18 year old guy who
  absolutely digs this film, especially due to the Holly Golightly
  character. After viewing this film for the first time, I
  developed a crush on the character Holly (kind of goofy, I guess,
  but it's very hard for me to dislike a character like her.)
  Audrey Hepburn played her to perfection. The film was also
  brilliantly shot by Franz Planer and directed by Blake Edwards. I
  love the film's dialogue as well, it has a very realistic
  quality, and it's so fun to hear the characters converse with
  each other. "Breakfast At Tiffany's" is perhaps the best "date"
  movie ever conceived. This film is an absolute classic that is
  worth subsequent viewings and it will never age.</Text>

  <Text category="dvd">For Ina Claire NINOTCHKA was a last chance
  to show posterity what she could do, for there wouldn't be many
  film opportunities offered her. She'd been a leading lady of the
  stage for nigh on thirty years, and her elegant beauty, very much
  a high-bred Dina Merrill type look, was still aglow. She was one
  of Carl Van Vechten's favorite subjects and he took photo after
  photo of her, staring imperiously against a wall of baize, or
  reclining on a lace pillow as fleecy as her beautiful blonde
  hair. She suffered the ultimate indignity the following year at
  MGM, when her part in I TAKE THIS WOMAN was taken away from her
  and given to the cheaper Verree Teasdale. Her director, Josef Von
  Sternberg was also let go, and in fact the whole picture was
  redone so many times studio wags called it I RE-TAKE THIS WOMAN!
  The "woman" in question was Hedy Lamarr; after Ina Claire's
  hilarious showdowns with Garbo in NINOTCHKA, the studio might
  have thought her perfect for the part of Lamarr's Central
  European rival. A year or so later, and Edmund Goulding put her
  to work as Dorothy McGuire's mother in the charming, underrated
  CLAUDIA, but that is definitely a mother part and as such, put an
  end to Ina Claire's film career. As the countess "Swana" she gets
  lots of Billy Wilder's best lines and laughs. She's not afraid of
  anyone, much less Garbo. Much has been written about the
  chemistry between Garbo and Melvyn Douglas, indeed a delightful
  mix, but the picture would have lacked a lot of its edge without
  Swana's steely, icy hauteur and her adroit manipulations. In real
  life Ina Claire lived on to a great old age. She was 92 when the
  last curtain fell for her, and here in San Francisco, where she
  spent most of her life, all the lights in her building went off
  for an hour, precisely at 8:30, while her fans stood on the
  street, devoted and vigilant in our own way as the fans
  surrounding the Dakota Hotel when John Lennon died</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">It takes an HBCU graduate to write about the
  HBCU experience, period. Just look at "A Different World" and how
  bad the first season was. Debbie Allen (a Howard grad, I believe)
  stepped in and gave the show the authenticity it sorely needed.
  So it's no surprise that Spike Lee, the Morehouse man, would make
  a movie that sparked so much emotion on both sides of the coin.
  I'm not saying that you had to attend an HBCU to UNDERSTAND
  "School Daze", but you had to have attended one to get the real
  "flavor" of what it was like. And you have to have an open mind.
  Any HBCU alum saying that this film wasn't realistic is flat-out
  lying. Yes, it hit on some things that the old folks call "dirty
  laundry" (such as hazing, color issues, those who think that
  getting an education makes you "white", and so on), but those
  things are real at HBCUs - yes, even today. (Major props to Spike
  for having that ONE dark-skinned sista in the Gamma Rays. Isn't
  that ALWAYS the way?) And there are no "good" people or bad
  people; Spike leaves that decision up to you. Julian had his good
  points (his intelligence, leadership and pride in his town,
  school, etc) and Dap had his bad points (his blatant bigotry and
  bullying), and both of them had legitimate points. One thing
  Spike nailed right on was the confrontations that the students
  tended to have on a regular basis. No offense to whites or anyone
  who graduated from a PWC, but in my experience at a predominately
  white high school, I noticed that students there were a lot more
  subtle with their dislike; they particpated in a more "destroying
  from within" kind of system, and grew wide-eyed and offended when
  confronted, even with solid proof. ("I would NEVER spread rumors
  about you/sleep with your boyfriend/steal your term paper!")
  Black students, on the other hand, will take ANYONE head-on,
  whether that person is the school president, captain of the
  football team, the richest kid on campus, crippled...doesn't
  matter. Your "status" doesn't count if you go to an HBCU. I had a
  friend who saw SD and said "That is SO unrealistic! Since when do
  college kids go fighting with each other all the time?" She
  graduated from the University of Texas. Enough said. I'm so
  grateful for this film, and its realistic portrayal of black HBCU
  students for those who think that all young black people do is
  have babies and suck up welfare, and that people only go to HBCUs
  because they can't get into a "real" college. I wouldn't trade my
  experience at Florida A&amp;amp;M University for a degree at any
  PWC. RATTLERS</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">Although Tomorrow is Yesterday is an okay
  episode, it is not one to rave about.It is certainly not one of

  of the best and one of my favourites.Kirk, Spock and McCoy
  investigate a planet where the inhabitants appear to be in a
  drug-induced state then rapidly change from walking peacefully
  and amiably along the streets into violent and looting maniacs
  that seem to lose all inhibitions. A mob attacks Kirk and crew
  and they are forced to defend themselves with their phasers. It
  seems the planet is run by a man named Landru, who advocates
  peace and tranquility to the extent that you get "absorbed".A
  kind of brainwash conditioning into thinking only of harmony and
  serenity.Later it is discovered that Landru is a computor
  projection;the edict of Landru who died 5,000 years ago has been
  continued by a computer I just read a review saying the solution
  to the Landru mystery won't surprise anyone, it sure surprised
  me. I didn't see that one coming</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">This DVD contains three episodes of "Bear in
  the Big Blue House." The first two have a birthday party theme.
  The final one doesn't really anything to do with a party, but it
  is still rocking. The fun starts with "Mouse Party" when our
  friends in the Big Blue House put together a surprise party for
  Tutter the mouse. The viewer is asked to keep the secret as they
  prepare the party - putting together the decorations, making the
  cake and keeping Tutter in the dark. Tutter considers the fact
  that he's getting older and finally, viewers rock to "Happy,
  Happy Birthday" when the time comes for Tutter's big party. Next
  comes "Bear's Birthday Bash." This is an episode that recalls
  "Mouse Party" in many ways, except this time it's Bear who's
  having the birthday. He'd like to have a nice, relaxing day, but
  the kids of the Big Blue House decide to throw him a surprise
  party. Finally, "Dancin' the Day Away" finds everyone in the Big
  Blue House having some fun with dance. Tutter, however, doesn't
  think that he can dance, but Pip and Pop show him that he really
  can. This is a fun show with awesome singing and adorable
  characters and stories. My favorites are Tutter and Ojo (and the
  big old Bear himself), but they're all wonderful. This DVD
  includes bonus sing-alongs of the various songs</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">Victor Hugo's enormous output is unique in
  French literature... He was described as 'The most powerful mind
  of the romantic movement' and his novel, published in 1862,
  continued to be widely read... The plot - that of a detective -
  is as well the epic of the people of Paris... Its author claimed
  it as a 'religious' work, and indeed by means of its characters,
  sometimes a little larger than life, yet always vital and
  engaging, and by its re-creation of the swarming Parisian
  underworld, the main theme of man's ceaseless combat with evil
  clearly emerges while the whole gives a faithful picture of the
  declines and flow of life... Hugo relives his youth in this vast
  novel, the culmination of 14 years work... He and Valjean share
  their most outstanding characteristic: their charitable heart...
  The story contains glimpses of Hugo's disgust towards 'the
  treatment of the lower class French citizens by the government:
  Valjean, an ex-convict recently released from prison, but he is
  not given the opportunity to make a good living for himself;
  Fantine forced into prostitution due to the lack of money to pay
  her illegitimate child... And towards the 'general injustice of
  the law enforcement system: Valjean sentenced to prison for
  stealing a loaf of bread; Fantine arrested for hitting a man of a
  higher class... The symbol of France's greed that Hugo despises
  is Thenardier - the man that Fantine entrusts Cosette to - who
  betrays the trust by essentially making Cosette his personal
  slave... The strongest emotions of "Les
  Mis&#239;&#191;&#189;rables are love and hate... Javert and
  Valjean are both extremes, with a conscience incredibly strict...
  Liam Neeson is cast as the gentle Valjean who takes the twist of
  fate parlaying it into personal success and moral
  rehabilitation... He changes his ways to become years later the
  much-loved mayor of Vigau, and as a caring businessman he
  struggles to forget the past and manages to redeem his soul
  becoming benevolent, giving manual and financial help to the
  weak, sick and poor... After nine years, Valjean was horrified to
  discover that Javert - a former guard of the Quarries of Toulon,
  where he served almost 20 years - has arrived to be the head of
  Vigau's police force... Valjean's desire to protect the employees
  from bad influences leads him to fire (indirectly) one of his
  workers Fantine - turned prostitute... He assumes responsibility
  for raising her daughter Cosette... He becomes a father figure
  and soon forces the choice of sacrificing his own freedom for her
  happiness... Geoffrey Rush plays the icy chief inspector Javert,
  the man who tries "to live his life without breaking a single
  rule." When he is given the job of spying in the barricades and
  Valjean gives him his freedom instead of shooting him, things
  begin to fall apart for him... The action of mercy of Jean
  Valjean causes him to doubt the solid base of his existence... He
  is in emotional agony unable to betray his convictions... He sees
  too late the truth... Valjean's legendary physical strength are
  enough to stir his suspicion that the town mayor is a fraud... He
  is less villain than a man driven by his own hard concept of
  justice begging permission of his superiors in Paris to
  investigate the mayor, the man he believes is a convict... When
  he thinks he has made a mistake in identifying Monsieur Le Maire
  as the 'convict' Jean Valjean, he insists on informing him that
  he has denounced him unjustly and that therefore he must be
  dismissed: "You must punish me", he says, "or my life will have
  been meaningless." (A key line in the film). Uma Thurman
  approaches the self-indulgent character of Fantine with admirable
  restraint, giving a certain level of charm and charisma to the
  film... She gives her sick mother role a good amount of realism
  demonstrating her character's frustration and pain exquisitely...
  Fantine's misery overwhelms her as she sells her body to support
  her child... Being in a wild state, enraged at how she is a
  helpless victim of misery, she is arrested after being humiliated
  by several would-be customers, but Valjean intercedes on her
  behalf overriding Javert's authority... When Valjean helps her,
  she begins to rediscover hope... Her joy at the thought of having
  Cosette with her is great... But the shock of Valjean's arrest
  and the discover that Cosette is not there, are too much for the
  poor creature... Claire Danes plays the teenage Cosette who
  realizes one day that she has become quite beautiful... She
  disobeys her father's rules by secretly sneaking out and seeing
  Marius - a charismatic young Parisian revolutionary - with whom
  she fell in love... Cosette spends her childhood as a servant
  girl at the Thenardier's inn, horribly mistreated and constantly
  terrified... She grew up in a convent, innocent, pure and a bit
  na&#239;&#191;&#189;ve... Peter Vaughan is excellent as the
  compassionate bishop whose act of generosity turns an embittered
  Valjean around... Bille August tries to capture the essence of
  Hugo's morality staging its political turmoil strongly enough to
  give it contemporary resonance, keeping the eternal three
  elements: the bishop handing over the candlesticks; Fantine's
  collapse; Marius crying out: "To the barricades!" History doesn't
  change, as Voltaire once remarked... But what we need from it,
  does... Valjean's story is not unique, it's universal... In other
  world, it's contemporary... There are certainly enough "Les
  Mis&#239;&#191;&#189;rables" to go all around the world...</Text>

  <Text category="dvd">Charles Laughton is typically wonderful in
  his broadly-played role as England's King, Henry the Eigth, who
  infamously married six different queens, divorcing or executing
  them as circumstances warranted. The script to this magnificent
  Alexander Korda production is a witty jab at English history
  buffs, touching only briefly on the supposed treachery of Ann
  Boleyn, concentrating instead on the preposterous emotional life
  of the lusty, capacious King. Laughton, as ever, is a marvel,
  skillfully presenting Henry at first as a thinly-cariacatured
  lout, and gracefully embuing him with gradual shades of pathos
  and humanity. Viewers who look to this film as historical drama
  are clearly missing the point: this is all about the
  cleverly-rendered script, which turns British schoolboy lessons
  on their heads, and on the classy ensemble acting, which
  admittedly may be hard to focus on with the lamentable quality of
  the current print (I'm writing in the year 2003; perhaps
  Criterion or some other class-act movie restoration company can
  correct this problem soon). Still, fans of early British cinema
  will enjoy this film a lot</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">For me, this movie is very different than
  other Holocaust movies, in that it explores the issue of what
  happened to Jewish spouses of Aryan women...the story itself is
  based on a true occurrence, and the movie begins with a
  wake...the widow is tormented by visions of her past in wartime
  Berlin &amp;amp; shows disapproval at her daughter's choice of a
  non-Jewish fiance...the daughter then discovers there is more to
  her mother's past than she was ever told, and travels to Germany
  to discover her mother's past...the story is told in flashbacks
  through reminiscences, and basically focusses on the plight of
  Aryan women in Berlin whose Jewish husbands have been confined in
  a place called Rosenstrasse...I won't give too much away, but I
  must say that for a slow-paced movie, it is quite gripping as we
  are kept guessing as to the final fate of the Jewish spouses...as
  for the acting, the characters from the past did an excellent
  job, their performances were very realistic, and heart-wrenching,
  especially the actress who plays the main role of Mrs Fabian
  Fischer, the Aryan wife. In the present day, the actress who
  plays the daughter who seeks to unearth her mother's past wasn't
  very convincing, but all in all the story itself makes up for
  other lacks in the movie, and it is definitely watchable for the
  unique plot</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">Seth Brundle (Goldblum) is a scientist who
  might just have invented the world's first teleporter. The only
  bug (pun intended) is the fact that it doesn't handle flesh and
  live teleportations. Ronnie (Geena Davis) is a writer for
  Particle magazine and will stay by his side, documenting via
  video his attempts to break through. Upon successfully
  teleporting a baboon, Seth gets cocky and decides to try and
  teleport himself; a fly slips into the pod while he teleports. At
  first, Seth finds newfound strength and agility, but pretty soon
  he's changing for the worst. This is one of Cronenberg's best
  films, masterfully directed and executed. It's also Jeff
  Goldblum's finest performance to date! Not content on doing a
  mere remake (the original Fly (1958) is a much different film
  starring Vincent Price), Cronenberg brings this film to the next
  level--literally. It's filled with deep human drama and let's not
  forget the award-winning special effects! Top notch effects
  contribute in putting this film ahead of the pack of other
  mid-eighties sci-fi/horror flicks. The film overall has aged well
  (it's already been twenty years) if not for the eighties fashion
  statements. I'm having a hard time figuring out which it is more;
  a sci-fi or a horror film? I guess it's a fusion of both (I gotta
  stop these bad puns!). Whether you see it for the first time or
  revisit it, Cronenberg's The Fly is a great gory,
  character-driven, profoundly human film. The second disc is chock
  full of special features: various documentaries and a making-of,
  screenplays, the original short story on which the original film
  is based, trailers for all the Fly movies ever made, deleted
  scenes, and much much more. A must have for any Cronenberg
  fan</Text>

  good band and, last but not least, by the marvellous Ikettes. All
  this at a time their performance must have been at its very
  peak.</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">The casting here was excellent - Ben
  Stiller, Elle Macpherson, Sarah Jessica Parker were all great. In
  fact, I am convinced that Elle Macpherson can act because of the
  3 movies I have now seen her in, she plays decidedly different
  people in each one. She is perfectly cast as Joe's dream woman. I
  found Eric Schaeffer's character the least appealing of the whole
  cast. Some of the jokes here are wildly funny. The audience is
  never given a clue that the Jane Lindquist character is only
  getting involved with Joe to indulge the fantasy world he had
  created of her. I thought it was odd that she enjoyed his
  voyeurism and then seemed honestly interested in him sexually,
  but was not interested in a relationship with him. Earlier her
  character makes a statement that the world makes too much of the
  sexually charged days in the beginning of relationships, people
  move on after that part is over and that a lasting relationship
  is what she wants. That part did not make sense. This could have
  been improved by some better writing and better character
  development. The humor here is what makes this worth
  watching</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">Othello is a difficult production for me to
  watch at any time. Seeing the horrors of jealousy run amuck to
  the destruction of innocence is painful at the best of times. In
  the instance of this production it is even more painful because
  it is so well done. The story of Othello is that of a Venetian
  general who marries a local daughter of a nobleman. The general
  happens to be black. In an effort to sabotage the general, Iago
  undermines the faith of the husband for his wife leading
  ultimately to the tragedy of her death. While Shakespeare gives
  motivations for his characters, interpretations and emphases tend
  to vary. Kenneth Brannagh's production of Othello emphasies Iago
  as a troublemake who likes to cause trouble simple for the sake
  of doing so. This production, with Ian McKellan in the role of
  Iago, puts more emphasis on his desire for revenge in reaction to
  a perceived slight. Both are accurate portrayals but the former
  seems to show more delight in "being bad" wheras the latter seems
  more inclined to "get even". Both are excellent and accurate but
  the emphasis in this film makes the heaviness of the theme that
  much more difficult to endure. The role of Desdemona is portrayed
  in this version by Imogen Stubb and she is a delight to watch.
  She bring an alluring innocence to the role that makes her demise
  all that much more tragic. So too is the title role played
  admirably. The problem with Othello is that he is at heart and
  honorable man but lets his passions rule him and cause him to
  lash out with devatiging consequence. This is a fine performance
  all around with a difficult play. If you can keep your anger at
  the antics of the characters in check, it is well worth the
  time</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">I grew up with the original DS. I also saw
  the two "spin off" movies: "House of Dark Shadows" and "Night of
  Dark Shadows." Needless to say I was extremely excited about the
  "revival," and I wasn't disappointed. I felt that Dan Curtis was
  actually able to improve upon the original, by tightening up the
  script and employing wonderful actors who fit like the proverbial
  glove. The original Barnabus was played by Jonathan Frid who was
  a Shakespearian trained actor and, Ben Cross is a member of the
  Royal Shakespearian Theatre in London. I loved that the revival
  was able to be more overtly sexual, which as any fan of vampires
  must know is an essential element of the myth. And I must say
  this series lived up to my every expectation. Dan Curtis took the
  original and made it completely accessible to older viewers who
  have such fond memories of the 1963 soap opera. I looked forward
  to 3:30 every day after school. It's too bad that the Gulf War
  killed it. Yes it did! I was there. After the Sunday, Monday
  miniseries, that Friday was to air the first "episode." However
  it was pre-empted by coverage of the War. Too, too bad. I taped
  it, but unfortunately the last few episodes were accidentally
  taped over. I am so glad to know that I can order it now in it's
  magical entirety. I'm ordering it right now! Thank you
  Amazon!!!!!!! If you are a fan of things that go bump in the
  night, you will LOVE this series!!!!</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">This Minnesota-filmed movie reportedly has a
  cult-following, and the reason is not far to realize. Joe
  Mazzello. Joe is a 1990s and 21st century motion-picture
  phenomenon. His presence in this movie is so REALISTIC and
  life-life that you forget that he is acting. He was pivotal in
  carrying this movie. How so? May I add that Joe's axiom for
  acting is simply: "Just make it look Real!" He achieved this to a
  stellar degree in "The Cure," and also in the later fare: "Simon
  Birch". Incredible acting, and I know good acting, for I was in a
  film in the early 1990s and also wrote the musical score for it.
  No, I am not going to name-drop. The Cure juxtaposes 2 boys of
  different social/geographical/educational genres together and in
  this movie a friendship is unexpectedly forged and may I add that
  it is a friendship of rare mutual-concern, honest caring, and
  warm affection. No matter how many times I watch it, tears always
  come to my eyes in the final 20 minutes of this film. Joe is the
  best!</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">This Jet Li movie is thus far the best movie
  since Shaolin Temple as Younger Jet Li. Its awesome surreal
  fighting creates this Epic feel to the whole Genre of martial
  arts fighting. Jet Li has never been so swift and so passionate
  in this movie. It has laughter, suspense, compassion, and
  innocense. The most spectacular scene is the dual fights with his
  son doing foot to shoulder cambat against the Witches pawn. This
  film is highly recommended to those who love Jet Li and Crouching
  Tiger, Hidden Dragon. An Excellent movie to add to the Jet Li
  collection</Text>

  a great super hero movie that had some humor built into it. It
  was well told and the characters were well developed. The special
  effects were great too!! I am not one for comic book heros, but
  this one confinced me otherwise. I recommend this movie to anyone
  that wants to see a good over evil story that was orginally a
  comic book character.</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">This movie classic, is a fabulous movie. The
  story represents a common dilemma faced by 1st generation young
  people whose parents are immigrants. Here is this sensitive,
  kind-hearted fellow, Marty, a butcher, who just wants to meet a
  nice girl and get married. Nobody really wants him to be happy
  and have his own life, especially his mother, and his aunt. These
  two actors play their character parts perfectly, just like real
  "battle-axes" from the "old country," etc. They gossip and try to
  ruin his relationship with a nice girl he has just met. It is
  hilarious and entertaining and very true to life. I love watching
  this movie over and over</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">Alfred Hitchcock's second film after being
  brought to America by David O. Selznick was SUSPICION, which he
  made while on loan to RKO Pictures. As in his first Hollywood
  flick, REBECCA, he put Joan Fontaine to very good use and
  ultimately these two films made her into a star. Fontaine won the
  Best Actress Academy Award for her portrayal of Lina McLaidlaw, a
  bookish and innocent (but wealthy) young woman who gets swept off
  her feet by the caddish Johnnie Aysgarth (Cary Grant). After
  their quick courtship and marriage against her father's wishes,
  Lina begins to see Johnnie for who he really is--a penniless
  leech--but she naively continues to love him nonetheless.
  Johnnie's charm is ostensible, yet his irresponsible ways are
  increasingly becoming inexcusable. Lina's trust eventually gives
  way to suspicion when she begins to believe that he might go to
  any length to pay off his mounting debts. Hitchcock masterfully
  builds suspense in this movie and manages to maintain it for the
  duration of the picture. The movie's only flaw is its tacked-on
  and seemingly contrived final scene which, we are told, was due
  either to Mr. Grant's popularity during these years or to the
  existence of the Production Code in effect in Hollywood at that
  time. Hitchcock wanted a darker ending but, as we see here, he
  lost that battle. However, he did not give in as completely as
  some would have us believe. The ending remains ambiguous enough
  to allow us to project either a happy or a sinister conclusion
  according to our own sensibilities. SUSPICION is classic
  Hitchcock. Grant and Fontaine turn in masterful performances and
  Nigel Bruce is irresistible as the dimwitted and loveable
  "Beaky," Johnnie's old chum. The flawed ending prevents placing
  SUSPICION at the top of any list of Hitchcock's achievements, but
  it is a fine film nevertheless and I can only give it my highest
  recommendation. Jeremy W. Forstad</Text>

  <Text category="dvd">I loved this movie...it was a little hard to

  <Text category="dvd">Scratching deeper beyond the surface one can
  find RETURN OF THE SEVEN to be significantly different from its
  predecessor, THE MAGNIFICENT SEVEN. It is much more than a
  thematically framed sequel which it can easily be mistaken for.
  RETURN OF THE SEVEN is a dark film and it does not offer the hope
  of a truly optimistic future for any of its characters. In this
  respect it is a complete inversion of THE MAGNIFICENT SEVEN.
  Through their catharsis in the original we saw an attempt at
  redemption through an act of nobility on the part of the seven.
  They truly were noble and I believe were redeemed for their
  transgressions as gunmen. Some thought they could start their
  lives over again but inevitably they could not. That film had to
  end as it did with the seven ultimately all committed to their
  singular code of ethics and morality in an emotionally charged
  finale. In this film there is very little emotion on the surface.
  Instead director Burt Kennedy gives us a thought provoking study
  into the human psyche and the very nature of defeatism of the
  human spirit. In this film there are no pretensions on the part
  of the seven. For most of them this is just another gun job.
  There are no higher aspirations that they are cognizant of. If it
  were not this job, it would be the next. To tell his story Burt
  Kennedy focuses almost entirely on the character of Chris the
  leader, perfectly portrayed again by Yul Brynner. This is not
  really a tale of the seven. Instead Kennedy uses Brynner with all
  his aplomb and apparent stoicism to curiously examine and probe
  the motivations of the other six, Lorca the villain (pompously
  played by Mexican director Emilio Fernandez) and several other
  key characters. In effect Kennedy takes what was apparently a
  happy or satisfactory ending from THE MAGNIFICENT SEVEN and asks
  what if. What if 10 years later the remaining characters are not
  so contented as prior events led us to believe they would be?
  Would friends be willing go up against innumerable odds? Would
  strangers once again sign on to go up against those same
  innumerable odds? Do the strong still have to help the weak? And
  who really are the strong and the weak? When 50 or more marauding
  vaqueros whisk away Chico (Julian Mateos) and other Mexican
  farmers from surrounding villages Chris and Vin (Robert Fuller)
  agree to come to his aid. However it is Chris alone that recruits
  the members of the "seven" this time out. Kennedy singularly
  endows Chris a sense of morality and level headedness in this
  film that comes from his wisdom and manner of nobility. In effect
  this is Brynner's film all the way. Just as John Sturges'
  directorial style was so smooth that his own storytelling glossed
  right over the depth and complexity of his own work so is Burt
  Kennedy's. However, Kennedy is challenged with a very dark and
  brooding tale to tell. Where Sturges' THE MAGNIFICENT SEVEN could
  easily have been taken on a purely action film level and still
  been successful, Kennedy does not have that luxury. Kennedy has
  to deliver an action film built on previous events and he also
  has to approach the story from a different perspective to remain
  fresh yet keep it thematically to the concept of the original
  "Seven." Not an easy task! If the viewer does not look deeply
  into this film it may just appear as a well produced `dud.'
  However, I believe Kennedy succeeds far beyond expectations the
  more times I view this film. Again it comes back to Brynner. He
  makes members of the seven (Vin, Chico and Colbee) all come to
  realizations about themselves with his subtle yet profound
  dialogue. He gives Riker and Luis a chance at redemption even
  though both men come from total opposites of the spectrum. He
  helps the failed priest rise from his failures "at least as far
  as his knees." Chris even gives Lorca, the villain a chance to
  ride out because when Chris was younger he gave him the same
  chance. However, Chris refuses to let Lorca now bathe his
  personal grief as an ineffectual father "in other men's blood."
  Yet even Lorca is literally redeemed by the end of the film. When
  Petra tells Chris that the farmers will never forget them he
  simply replies, "That's all a man can ask." That is the mystique
  and legacy of the "seven." Even the character of Chris is endowed
  with human flaws. He recklessly took on the young Manuel rounding
  out the seven "for luck" with tragic results and we see Brynner
  deeply grieved on the screen. This is a film of hard lessons
  learned. Technically this is a well-made film. The cinematography
  is full of crane, dolly and tracking shots, which gives it both
  perspective and movement. Bernstein's score is full and lush and
  this is the single cohesive element that keeps the seven
  together. The set designs are dark, grim and rustic giving the
  film a pensive psychological depth. The payoff for Brynner and
  the viewer comes in the final shot. Looking at the farmers
  rebuilding the village he comments, "I'll be damned." Vin looks
  at him and responds, "I doubt that. I doubt that very much." They
  both ride off. They just don't make heroes like that any
  more</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">The movie is excellent. I was hoping to find
  the directors cut with additional footage, but the regular DVD is
  excellent as well. Not many additional features, but the movie is
  delightful and, although slightly longer then some, holds the
  viewers interest. Minor amounts of nudity, some very graphic fist
  fighting, but not excessive and always appropriate to the plot.
  One of Ron Howard's best films</Text>

  It's great to have this collection available to film fans. We can
  overlook Chaney's stiffness, as the rest of the cast really
  compensates for it</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">I own both the ultimate Editon and the

  four times and "the future is not set" should be highlighted,
  push enter and you should see "play theatrical version on your

  <Text category="dvd">When people talk about buddy-buddy films
  this one gets overlooked.This was a refreshing break from the
  Eastwood mold,stepping down from the Dirty Harry altar, to switch
  sides of the law or God(as a preacher).This has a loaded cast,
  Clint Eastwood, Jeff Bridges(Oscar nominee/robbed)to George
  Kennedy, as another evil meanie.The oddball teaming of Eastwood
  and Bridges seals the movie as an enjoyable romp, where
  cross-dressing,wearing disguises and other stuff plays
  second-hand to the relationship which is supposed to be
  mentor/rookie but becomes Laurel/Hardy too often.The story itself
  wanders off in various directions until it comes home with
  unexpected sadness, marking the arrival of the versatile
  Bridges.Like "Collateral," where Cruise lets Jamie Foxx run with
  the movie, Eastwood generously let Bridges vamp for effect. Such
  a free-wheelin' script has not hit the screen in a long

  <Text category="dvd">Daniel Day-Lewis must be the most versatile
  film actor in the world. He looks like a different person in
  almost every film he makes. I assume that's the real Day-Lewis in
  this flick about the rebellion in Northern Ireland, revenge and
  absolution. His romantic interest, Emily Watson, puts in a good
  performance too. Day-Lewis looks a lot different than he did in
  &amp;amp;quot;Gangs of New York&amp;amp;quot;, &amp;amp;quot;The
  Unbearable Lightness of Being&amp;amp;quot;, &amp;amp;quot;My
  Left Foot&amp;amp;quot; and &amp;amp;quot;Last of the
  Mohicans&amp;amp;quot; but he is just as compelling in his
  performance. I thought this movie degraded a bit at the end with
  its somewhat Hollywood finale, but otherwise I enjoyed it. If you
  like substantial filmmaking, good acting, great drama, unfamiliar
  vistas and a good story, you'll enjoy it too</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">A pure and engaging story of redemption
  amongst family, `You Can Count on Me' tells the story of Sammy
  (Laura Linney) and Terry Prescott (Mark Ruffalo), siblings who
  lost their parents in a horrific car crash when they were still
  very young. Years later and Sammy is a single mother of
  8-year-old Rudy (Rory Culkin), she works hard at her job at the
  bank, now run by over critical Brain Everett (Matthew Broderick),
  and she struggles with telling her son just how much of a jerk
  his father really is (Josh Lucas has a great cameo as Rudy
  Senior). When Terry shows up after months of no communication
  Sammy is immediately thrilled, but shortly after his arrival she
  realizes her brother is still a screw-up and is just using her,
  again. Terry shows up in need of money to pay for his
  girlfriend's abortion, but when his girlfriend tries to commit
  suicide he decides he needs to take a break from his life and so
  he stays with Sammy and Rudy. Over the course of a few weeks
  Terry has made a deep impact, especially in the life of young
  Rudy who idolizes him. This film follows the changes each of
  these siblings make, changes in themselves but also changes they
  cause others to make. It's a beautiful story of redemption and
  acceptance and it shouldn't be missed. The performances by the
  two leads are outstanding, and young Rory Culkin is adorable and
  mature as Sammy's son, but the real shock to me was Matthew
  Broderick who played the demanding, philandering, unlikable type
  brilliantly, and he's not one I'm generally impressed with</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">Ed Friedlin is a monthly writer for bass

  marcus miller style and it is laid out in a very good manner.
  very good instructional video</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">This is an honestly forgivably slightly too
  long film that manages to be surprisingly crass with three
  dimensional characters and capture much of war's bad brutality
  (but necessity hey the men and women set fire to are all deranged
  nazis). I love the scenes best where Sutherland plays a general
  and the part where the english chicks show up at sort of dance
  with the dozen (interesting if English Jill Ireland had been one
  of the ladies there--with Charles Bronson looking at her-- which
  she wasn't---but the mostly hot chicks they have do just fine).
  Before I saw the film I heard Ernest Borgnine was in the movie
  and I thought he was going to be one of the dozen. There is no
  really solidly likable member of the dozen (Sutherland's probably
  the closest they come to this and he is rather undeveloped) and
  Borgnine could have fit the bill very nicely had he been a
  convict--instead they've got him in a more dull role of a
  general. But what the dozen lack in likability they make up for
  in interest. Cassavettes (whom I strongly physically resemble by
  the way) is outstanding as the most crooked but slickest member
  of the dozen and he shines best. Savalas is next best as the lust
  hating psycho (hey sex between men and women is needed to produce
  babies, Telly, or the human race would have ceased to exist a
  long time ago and the book of Genesis talks of man and woman
  becoming one). Bronson is the true chameleon of an actor as just
  8 years later he'd be the very different vigilante Paul Kersey of
  Death wish so different than the very tough but still gentler
  fellow he plays here. Marvin brilliant in the lead as the head
  major leading the dozen(probably even better than the very good
  John Wayne would have been). Nice turn by Bob Ryan as a decent
  colonel who rather understandably makes things hard for the
  covert dozen. The rest of the cast is mostly very good too. Very
  good film!</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">This is one of my all-time favorite vampire
  movies. The cast led by Tom Cruise as the vampire Lestat, and
  Brad Pitt as the vampire Louis does an excellent job of bringing
  to life Anne Rice's Interview with the Vampire. The costumes and
  sets are evocative of the respective eras the vampires live
  through, and the cinematography is lush and sensual, evoking the
  decadent lifestyle that Lestat leads...even Kirsten Dunst has a
  role here as a child vampire, and her famous line "I want some
  more" has been rendered immortal in movie history. The chemistry
  between Lestat [Cruise] &amp;amp; Louis [Pitt] is believable and
  in fact, they give one of their best dramatic performances in
  this movie. All in all, a cinematic treat</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">I would reccomend this film to any Robert
  Johnson fan as well as to anyone just getting into the blues who
  wants to know where its really at. It includes some great
  interviews with Johnny Shines, Robert jr Lockwood and others who
  knew Robert. Its worth it just to hear Lockwood play an
  unrecorded song of R.J.'s! The parts where Keb' Mo' re-enacts
  segments from R.J.'s life are well done and effectively
  illustrate what life would have been like back then for a
  traveling bluesman. My only criticism would be that there are few
  extra DVD features,however, that doesn't stop me watching this
  film again and again! A very informative insight into the life of
  one of the greatest Delta bluesmen</Text>

  <Text category="dvd">This is my second favorite John Woo movie
  with great touches of action and drama, When I first saw this
  film (about 5 years ago) I wasn't used to seeing this much
  violence on screen (And I thought Lethal Weapon was extremely
  violent at that time) I was in shock and more then once my jaw
  dropped. This film is VERY violent But compared to other action
  films this is REALLY tame nowadays. The minor points of this film
  would be some bad acting to some worse acting in some spots, some
  weird cuts and editing, the subs were terrible, as the same with
  the audio quality and some of the camera work is bad, but this is
  John Woo's first (if you can count heroes shed no tears) landmark
  heroic bloodshed film so we all know he could have done worse
  MUCH worse. Yun fat chow, Ti Lung and Leslie Chung have their
  good moments to bad moments, most of the good moments goes to
  Chow and Ti while Leslie had only one or two moments. The plot is
  like this A cop must confront his criminal brother. That's it. If
  your the typical Hollywood action goer this is your perfect find.
  But as I said if your new to the heroic bloodshed films don't
  make this your first one, I'll say stick with the killer and hard
  boiled for a few weeks then move on. But if your the Hollywood
  action movie goer make this your first if you can handle it move
  on to the other heroic bloodshed films and so on. This film is a
  big landmark in the action genre and a even bigger landmark to
  the underground action genre. I really recommend this film to any
  action fan!!!!</Text>

  <Text category="dvd">This was a very interesting movie. A friend
  told me to watch this movie after I told him that I really liked
  the movie The Skeleton Key. I think I liked The Skeleton Key

  scenes with nudity in it. Not a movie for the youngsters. We had
  to stop the movie a couple times to talk about it and at the end
  my husband was the only one who guessed how it was going to end.

  <Text category="dvd">This movie was one of the most honest,

  <Text category="dvd">With season 4 the series starts to slide a
  little. I don't think the show is weaker,it's just that how long
  can you watch a story before it starts to seem like you been
  there done that already? Look, I love the Godfather one and
  two,but three is just not as good. The total time it takes to
  watch the first two Godfather films is a little over 5 hours!
  That won't even get you through season one of the Sopranos. I
  hope I speak for everyone out there when I say that as good as
  the Sopranos is, it will never come closed to the Godfather
  movies. So I guess it is just starting to get old. I will
  certainly be watching the finale episodes, I just hope it isn't
  too big a let down. For those who are interested the DVD set has
  great transfers, but few interesting extras</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">For sheer excitement, you cannot beat this
  DVD. The music is exciting, arranged well for brass ensemble, and
  recorded with high quality. But that's only the beginning... In

  How they manage this energy level will flat-out amaze you. I can
  honestly say that, after just seeing these performances, you are
  as happily exhausted as the performers must be. Prepare to be
  thrilled..</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">What a great idea, to make a documentary of
  violinist Hilary Hahn traveling around the world and
  concertizing. Undoubtedly at the top of her profession, Hahn
  never fails to amaze with her unmistakably gorgeous tone,
  enviable precision, and brilliant musicality. This DVD "portrait"
  includes personal footage of Hahn backstage at the Philharmonie
  in Berlin, as well as a tour at the Curtis Institute, a recording
  session at Abbey Road Studios, and a trip to Hong Kong. In an age
  of music commercialism, Hahn is refreshingly real and
  self-deprecating. Included on this DVD are excerpts from the
  Korngold Concerto, Mozart Sonata for Piano and Violin in G major,
  The Lark Ascending by Vaughan Williams, Chaconne from Partita in
  D minor by Bach, and the Paganini Concerto No. 1. On the menu
  there is additional concerto footage, which includes the Korngold
  Concerto and Mozart sonata in their entirety - thank goodness,
  because there's nothing more aggravating than replaying excerpts.
  If for nothing else, buy the DVD for these complete live
  recordings, because they are absolutely sublime. The outer
  movements of the Korngold sound a lot like film music, which the
  classical music lover may or may not like, but the second
  movement is incredibly beautiful and highly recommended. The
  Mozart sonata is also very well played, but this is nothing new
  as Hahn has already released a recording of this. This DVD is
  important because it contains video footage of Hahn performing -
  the only other DVD where you can find her playing is The Last
  Night of the Proms, in which she plays the Mozart Concerto No. 4
  in D Major and Presto from Sonata No. 1 by Bach, but the sound
  quality is somewhat lacking and certainly doesn't do justice to
  Hahn</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">Don't discount this film because you are
  dismayed by Tom Cruise. This film is excellent and a must see.

  movie, as he should</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">The essence of painter Francis Bacon is not
  a personal life lived on the sordid side but how he was forced to
  take in life. Seen through his central nervous system and eyes,
  we experience his world of fragments, like collage pieces of
  existence. The only place he could make those fragments whole was
  in a painting. Otherwise, he was wholly inable to put a fully
  realized human being, himself, together. Tellingly, one of his
  best friends comments that he has done a superb one-on-one job
  with his lover George in his paintings of George. However, he has
  been unable to do that in his actual life lived with George! That
  sums up Bacon, his art and his life, in a nutshell. Bacon is not
  a person you will like but you will understand him and how the
  fragments of his existence made for great art. Yet he is also the
  most alone person imaginable, something no amount of lovers and
  sordid excess could allay. One of the very best films about an
  artist ever made. You don't need to see the actual finished
  paintings since it is the fragments he used to build his
  paintings in his head that matter here. If you want to see his
  paintings, you should be able to find page after page of them
  online in about a minute, or less, using any visual search
  engine</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">I think Pauly Shore is much more talented
  then people give him credit for. It is not as easy at it seems to
  play the character he played in every single one of his films.
  But the problem is that he has played the same character in all
  the movies he made. Frankly I dont think he made this movie or
  started his new reality show to restart his career, I think he
  probably knows that he is a living joke, I feel he is just trying
  to give people a laugh and I'd say hes done that</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">One of the most compelling events of the
  release of Kenneth Lonergan's You Can Count On Me is that it gave
  visibility to Mark Ruffalo who plays a troubled young man who,
  unable to deal with the childhood trauma of having lost his
  parents to a car crash, lives of life of unattached agony and
  isolation. He's a loner and a drifter, medicating his self-pity
  with pot and short-lived relationships. His sister Sammy, played
  wonderfully by Laura Linney, reacts to the same tragedy by being,
  in many ways, an overresponsible overcontrolling super mom. Two
  opposite reactions to the same tragedy of course result in a
  sibling clash. This film shows with great complexity and biting
  comic insight, the attempt of this brother and sister to shed
  their defense mechanisms and most importantly reconnect with one
  another. The ride is never easy in this film. No easy answers are
  given. Just as important, this film, which deals with the pain of
  loss, never descends into the maudlin Hallmark movie sap that
  other films would. Balancing edgy humor and profound
  psychological insight, Lonergan has written and directed a tale
  that captures the layers upon layers of psychological complexity
  that accompany the trauma of loss. Amazingly, he does it in a
  fast-paced film with scenes that are by turns comic and dramatic.
  Matthew Broderick, for example, plays a hilarious role of Sammy's
  neurotic anal-retentive boss at the bank. The conflict between
  him and Sammy leads to a plot point that I'll let you discover in
  the film. But most of all, this film shines because Mark Ruffalo
  plays such an endearing, sympathetic, sometimes infuriating
  character. You won't forget him</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">Phillip Hoffman is searching for purity.
  Unfortunately his play has been purchased by a wild Hollywood
  movie crew, and they are off and shooting in Waterford, Vermont
  because Main Street is already there. It is cheaper than building
  a set. Then the town folks, New Englanders, dry and pragmatic,
  mingle with Hollywood slime balls, daft, smooth-talking director,
  William H. Macy and screen idol, young girl chasing, Alex
  Baldwin. Sarah J. Parker of Sex in the City fame plays the
  nymphomaniac actress bedding everyone in sight. Small town smart
  girl Rebecca Pigeon and writer Hoffman make the necessary changes
  in the script and then they fall in love. A scandal threatens the
  shoot and somebody forgets the mayor's dinner party. There is
  plenty of manic fun here. I recommend for a good laugh. Also, is
  it just me or is William H. Macy the best actor in the
  world</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">Orange County as a movie tries to play it
  safe. The Director tries to be in tow with what he believes is a
  good film. I must say for around 50% of the film I was laughing.
  Jack Black is truly my favourite character in the film. Colin
  Hanks,the lead actor, is a boring sophisticated person.He also
  plays Black's brother in the film. Although Jack Black doesnt
  have a huge role in it, everytime he's on the screen I seem to
  forget all the other characters around. I thought the scene in
  which he jumps into the swimming pool with just his under-shorts
  was funny. But I defintely feel there are some seven other scenes
  featuring this master of crazy comedy. I didnt find Colin
  Hanks(in the film) inspiration inspiring at all and think he
  should have gone to Stanford.For the simple reason I believe he
  didnt have much enough at Orange County to wait for.But then
  that's a story flaw or story strength(however you perceive it)
  Come to think of it Colin Hanks character was extremely
  realistic,polite and believable.Now all the credit in the world
  to the director for this.However,it was the drugged Jack Black
  who really tries to get him into something. Ive seen School Of
  Rock and I'm sorry for I did not like it as much as I liked
  Orange County.It's the presence of Jack Black that does it for
  me.I've seen the film 4 times which is probably why I can't stand
  Hanks and his goodness. Anyhow,forget all that , watch the film -
  rent it , steal it, buy it,download it....just give it a watch.
  Cheers</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">This film is one big joke: you have all the
  basics elements of romance (love at first sight, great passion,
  etc.) and gangster flicks (brutality, dagerous machinations, the
  mysterious don, etc.), but it is all done with the crudest humor.
  It's the kind of thing you either like viserally and immediately
  "get" or you don't. That is a matter of taste and expectations. I
  enjoyed it and it took me back to the mid80s, when Nicolson and
  Turner were in their primes. The acting is very good, if a bit
  obviously tongue-in-cheek. Recommended</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">The special was filmed in 1970 and reflected
  the time period--there's a kind of flower power feel to it but it
  was well done. Doris and Perry Como's duet together was ok (but
  Perry seemed to not like Doris flirting with him.) Doris Day has
  always been under-rated as a singer. Her voice is sheer
  perfection. It's too bad that Doris didn't do more specials or
  have a variety/comedy/musical show like Carol Burnett.</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">We caught this movie on PBS when it first
  came on, and my daughter was hooked. It's a change from the
  regular Arthur animation - this one is computer animated. She was
  very intrigued by that fact, and then the story is about a
  puppy... well there you go! The story is well written, a little
  scary at times when the guard dogs are chasing after Pal. There
  are even a few catchy tunes as well. Highly recommend this to
  every Arthur fan out there</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">I'm probably going to invest in a re-order
  of this DVD collection, because I simply have worn this one out.
  From the "They Call It Pro Football" opening to final gun of
  Super Bowl X, this collection grips your attention and never lets
  go. The writing is superb - I especially like NFL 68' - and The
  highlights... Well, it was when pro football was pro football. It
  was interesting watching teams endure psychological hardships, as
  was the Case with the Dallas Cowboys of the late 60's- Early
  70's. "Next Year's Champions" were the epitome of resiliency.
  "The Championship Chase" was a pure joy to view. If ever there
  was a peak in John Facenda's narrative career with NFL Films,
  this was it; though in the alternative, I loved his voice-overs
  in Super Bowls III, IV, VII, and IX. Ed and Steve Sabol Really
  hit the bulleye with Blair Motion Pictures. I would have loved to
  see more AFL highlights, but that's just nit-picking. GREAT
  JOB!!!</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">I did not think, that the women Juliet
  Lewis, plays in this movie was mentally retatrted, i think she
  just has a disablity.\ I hate that lable, if someone can walk and
  talk, and learn. I don't think so.</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">I think if Charles Bukowski, Dylan Thomas,
  and Fellini collaborated on a piece of writing, it's possible
  they would have come up with this screenplay. This movie is
  exciting because it's soooo different from anything I've ever
  seen. Deliciously non-linear. The substance abuse aspect is a
  little overdone but that's the destiny of &amp;amp;quot;artist
  movies&amp;amp;quot;. I loved hearing the dialog, and
  Kristofferson's acting is the best I've ever seen by him.
  Anything so daring and so unconventional will naturally upset
  some people (like other reviewers here), but if you ask me that
  only validates the work. If ever I go to New York City, the Hotel
  Chelsea will be at the top of my list of places to visit. My
  favorite lines were by the crazy guy in the elevator, who after
  claiming to have had a conversation with Dylan Thomas said that
  ghosts naturally reside in places like the Chelsea because people
  will listen to them there. The DVD extras contain a couple of
  quirky interviews, one with director Ethan Hawke and the other
  with Robert Sean Leonard who plays a deeply troubled folksinger
  in the film</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">Dracula. How dare you call yourself a horror
  fan without even seeing it? You don't have to like it, but damn
  it, you should at least see it. You can thank Dracula for all the
  gothic imagery that's been used time and time again in movies
  throughout the years, right up to this very day. You can also
  thank Dracula for all the goth chicks running around, and that's
  either a good or bad thing depending on your tastes. Dracula's
  not my favorite movie from Universal's golden era, but I've seen
  it quite a few times in my life and will probably see it many
  more before I buy the farm. Lugosi managed to create THE Dracula.
  They even discuss this in the documentary on the disc, but even
  folks who have never seen the film before instantly get the image
  of Lugosi's Dracula in mind when someone brings the subject of
  Dracula up. Even with all the different actors who've played the
  role over the years(some turning in wonderful performances, some
  not so wonderful), they all seem to be in Lugosi's shadow somehow
  coz he just WAS Dracula. Lugosi gave a voice to Dracula. Ever do
  a Dracula impersonation or hear someone else do one? What voice
  did you(or they) use? Lugosi's of course. However, I don't think
  I'd like this film half as much if it hadn't had been for Dwight
  Frye as Renfield. Frye is rather unappreciated and never became
  well known outside the horror circle. He is to the character of
  Renfield what Lugosi is to Dracula. Sorry, Tom Waits just didn't
  cut the mustard for me. This film is many years old and probably
  wouldn't be considered frightening by a five year old kid. In
  fact, it most likely comes across as silly to younger folks with
  Lugosi's exaggerated stares, hand movements and dialogue. Not to
  mention Frye's overacting as well. But the fact of the matter is,
  this movie scared the pants off people in it's time. When was the
  last time modern audiences saw a film that truely frightened
  them? Who knows, and it's not likely to happen again in our
  rather desensitized society. In fact, I doubt most modern
  moviegoers even have the attention span to sit through this 75
  minute film. Anyhow, you owe it to Bela, Dwight and yourself to
  check it out. As for the other films in the set, it's kinda hit
  and miss, but none of them are bad by any means. Apparently
  somewhere along the lines, Dracula fathered two kids(!) coz we
  have Dracula's Daughter and Son Of Dracula. Neither movie is all
  that bad. Dracula's Daughter actually tries to be a direct sequel
  to the original film with the daughter trying to rid herself of
  the vampire curse. Dracula's son on the other hand seems to enjoy
  the vampire lifestyle. Chaney makes a decent enough vampire, but
  this son didn't inherit his father's suaveness and charisma. The
  spanish version is a really cool gem that almost seems more
  atmospheric than the american version. House Of Dracula's kind of
  the odd one out as it's really a sequel to House Of Frankenstein,
  which itself is a sequel to Frankenstein Meets The Wolf Man.
  House of Dracula is best viewed as a double feature with House Of
  Frankenstein. Like the Frankenstein and Wolf Man sets, this one
  has an interesting documentary tracing Dracula from Bram Stoker's
  novel right up to the Frank Langella film version. Also sliming
  his way into this set is Stephen Sommers flapping his gums again
  about how Dracula influenced his piece of crap Van Helsing movie.
  Don't ask me why I watched this feature, maybe I was looking for
  a reason to get pissed. Anyhow, with a price tag like this and
  five Universal classics, it certainly sold me.</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">The Wolf Man Legacy set a no brainer.Like
  all the classic Universal Legacy sets the special features are
  worth the price alone. Jack Pierce's Make up and Wolfman Creation
  are still the best! This set along with Dracula and Frankenstein
  Legacy collections enables you to see the entire series in order
  as sequels to the inferior but still hard to dislike monster
  rallies they would end with. You still need Abbott and Costello
  meets Frankenstein to truely complete the series</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">I don't understand why there are so many low
  reviews here. This movie was one of the funniest movies I've ever
  seen. Also, it was very unique. I think that too many people are
  trying to project these actions in real life. This movie is
  FICTION. All the people who gave this movie a bad review should
  stop trying to see what's real about this movie and just sit back
  and laugh. This movie was extremely funny!!</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">I think Woody Allen is the best director
  currently in the business and I believe his serious-themed movies
  are the reason. He excells at making us look at ourselves. If I'm
  not mistaken, "Interiors" was his first venture into dramatic
  movies. For having led the way, this movie is noteworthy.
  However, it is also exemplary in helping define the genre of the
  Woody Allen movie. It defines the Woody Allen film by showing us
  what it is not. Woody Allen's greatness is in being able to let
  us take a critical look at ourselves. His characters have faults
  that we share. Whatever passions that we have fallen prey to, we
  see them in a new light through Allen's masterful script and
  direction. The problem with "Interiors" is that most of us could
  not relate to the problems that the characters in "Interiors"
  have. Many of them belong under the category of mental illness
  while others are taken too far to the extreme to be relevant to
  us. Woody was on the right track but he was overly influenced by
  Ingar Bergman. Allen's own style quickly emerged after this movie
  and we have been the better for it. Taken in its' own right,
  "Interiors" is an above-average movie. The acting is excellent
  and the mood of the movie is very tense in a somber manner. The
  movie is simply overwhelming and we are left wondering who would
  ever have been so deranged as to have married into this mess.
  These people deserve themselves and that is an observation that
  applies to no other Woody Allen cast (with the bumbling exception
  of the cast of "What's New Pussycat?"). Woody Allen took a turn
  towards drama and hit a speed bump on the way. Fortunately, he
  learned from his experience.</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">The story is a rather strange mixture of
  innocence and evil with Mitchum in one of his nastiest roles.
  It's almost like he was rehearsing for his nastiest role in CAPE
  FEAR. He meets his match in Lillian Gish's character who stands
  up to him and is just as courageous and savvy as she is "sweet".
  In fact, the performances were great all around in this
  atmospheric film. Charles Laughton, in his only stint at
  directing, does an excellent job but I think he might have done
  more with the climax because it did seem that it could have been
  a little better and have more tension. A very good example of
  film noir</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">I had two choices watching this
  movie...smile or laugh out loud. When I wasn't smiling I was
  laughing. Keaton's The General is a perfect introduction for
  those who may shy away from silent movies or who may think silent
  comics are too exaggerated and mannered. The story line is
  simple, but what Keaton does with it is genius. Johnny Gray
  (Buster Keaton) is an engineer for the Western and Atlantic
  Railroad. He has two loves, his engine, the General, and
  Annabelle Lee (Marion Mack), a fine Southern belle. When war
  starts, Johnny rushes to enlist but is rejected. He's more
  valuable to the South as a train engineer than he would be as a
  soldier. Trouble is, nobody tells him why he was rejected. Worse,
  Annabelle thinks he may be a coward, and tells him she doesn't
  want to see him again until he is in uniform. Just then northern
  spies secretly enter the town to steal the General and take it
  north, destroying bridges and lines along the way, while a
  Northern army moves south. Unknowingly, Annabelle Lee finds
  herself on the train and is kidnapped. Johnny sees the General
  chugging away and races after it, determined to bring back the
  General. When he realizes Annabelle Lee is held captive, his
  resolve knows to bounds. For the rest of the movie we are on one
  of the cleverest, fastest, funniest chase movies ever filmed.
  Keaton creates slapstick situations and sight gags that not only
  are funny, but that always are in character and which always are
  part of the specific plot point. And when he rescues Annabelle
  and realizes how hopeless her Southern belle helplessness can be,
  his exasperation is matched only by his love. The General
  features a big cast, a major battle, fleeing armies, a failing
  dam and a spectacular moment when an engine tries to cross a
  burning bridge and everything collapses into a river gorge.
  Keaton's timing and inventiveness are legendary; so is his
  risk-taking. He does all his own stunts and some of them were
  dangerous. In one, he is lying back on the engine's cow catcher
  while the train is moving at some speed forward. In the distance
  is a railroad tie across the tracks. Keaton has another railroad
  tie in his hands. At the last moment he tosses his tie so that
  the end hits the end of the other tie and they both bounce off
  the track just as Keaton on the cow catcher passes. This scene
  has no cutting. The two ties fly off as high as Keaton's head. He
  could have been killed; instead we laugh. It's amazing that in
  his older years Keaton could still walk. His body took incredible
  punishment for the laughs. Try falling hard backwards off a
  moving flatcar and landing on your back across railroad ties. His
  ingenuity is extraordinary. How do you build excitement out of an
  extended train chase? Both engines are behemoths and are on the
  same track. They can't pass each other. Keaton does it with
  endless bits of business. In fact, he does manage to reverse the
  chase at one point in an immensely clever moment combining logic
  and split-second timing. What makes Keaton so funny and so
  contemporary is that he doesn't do double-takes. He barely
  reacts. But he's no stone-face. Keaton's characters are simply
  very serious fellows. Things happen to them. His characters don't
  react to events so much as they overcome them with honesty and
  good intentions. This edition of The General comes from Kino
  Video and looks good. It includes two Keaton short films, The
  Playhouse (1921) and Cops (1922). In The Playhouse, Keaton
  portrays all the members of the cast, orchestra and audience in a
  stage show, including nine members of a minstrel act, the ladies
  in the audience and a trained chimp. In Cops, he finds himself in
  a police chase that is one amazing situation after another</Text>

  <Text category="dvd">This is a wonderful show and very true to
  the band's recent live performances, albeit with a condensed
  songlist. I give it only 4 stars because I had the pleasure of
  seeing Mr. Winwood and band live and the Sound Stage gig seems
  just a tad below that experience--which is admittedly an unfair
  comparison. Nothing to knock about this tidy show by a true
  virtuoso (actually a band of virtuosos). Consider it 4.5.</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">I highly recommened these DVD's! How
  exciting and refreshing it is to pop in a DVD and go back in time

  <Text category="dvd">This is a fantastic version of TAMING OF THE
  SHREW. For anyone who is interested in really studying the text
  (and hearing it spoken correctly), this is the version for you!
  The actors speak clearly and loudly and the main point is that
  they completely understand what they are saying - (yipee!) They
  also have an uncanny way of "speaking the speech" which gets it
  across to the audience as clear as day. You dont need to
  understand 'Shakespearean verse' to see this performance. The
  actors breeze through this with ease and simplicity and look like
  they are having a blast - which I belive they are!</Text>

  <Text category="dvd">The Concert in Central Park is not only the
  best of Simon &amp;amp; Garfunkel's concerts, it is one of the
  best of anyone's concerts, in my estimation. The crowd was really
  in to it, and Simon and Garfunkle responded to them and delivered
  a top notch experience which captured the essence of the best of
  their music, and the era it was written in. I have owned the VCR
  tape for years, and enjoyed it many times, but the signal was
  beginning to fade, so I was very pleased to see it released on
  DV</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">This is the 2000 or so version of the DVD.
  This is identical with the VHS version, except it adds two
  features. The first is an excellent "Making Of" video from 1996
  -- which was re-done with a different host for 2006, but all the
  "interview" segments are the same. The second was a "Making Of"
  video done for the DVD, which doesn't add a whole lot. Were I to
  do it again, I'd buy this version, and skip the 2006 "50th
  anniversary" release. This is the classic Chuck Jones television
  "Grinch", in one of the best packages for it. And the "Horton
  Hears A Who" is also a Chuck Jones classic. "A person's a person,

  <Text category="dvd">I just finished watching Callie and Son. I
  got my copy from the Dollar Store and it has another movie (Power
  Passion and Murder) with Michelle Pfeiffer in it as well... It
  really wasn't that bad, considering the price I paid. Lindsay
  Wagner is actually the main character and I think she did a great
  job, as did most of the actors in this film. The only trouble is
  the movie lasted about a hour longer than it needed to. With a
  bit of editing and a bit better script, it would have been a
  great movie! The end was somewhat unexpected and horrifying...
  I'd recommend it for someone to watch once, but I wouldn't pay
  more than I did for it. The DVD quality is really poor, the sound
  fades in and out, but for what it was, a bargain bin cheapy, I
  was pleasantly surprised by how much I enjoyed it.</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">Never in my life have I seen a film
  dedicated to the subject of Vichy France. I had long read about
  it but knew very little about the official pronouncements of the
  collaborationist government. I assumed that The Sorrow and the
  Pity was strictly a documentary about the French resistance, but
  was pleasantly surprised by its depth. It describes the Vichy of
  Petain and Laval quite thoroughly. You may recognize some of
  Ophuls' interviewees from The World at War (such as Edward
  Spears), but the stand out individual here was the fellow who
  volunteered for the SS. I assume he served in the Charlemagne
  outfit. Frankly, I was surprised he was alive and actually
  showing his face. His point that the slaughter of 1,600 French
  sailors by the English was a motivating force for him to join the
  Germans was something I would have never considered. It seems
  inconceivable back then for the French to have even hesitated
  siding with anybody other than England--given the
  competition--but it is clear that Anglophobia was rampant after
  "the rout" of May 1940. The most sensational thing about this
  film is the footage of the collaborationists. It seems as if
  modern history has made great attempts to cover up just how much
  the citizenry backed Petain (at first) and looked sympathetically
  to the Nazis. The speeches, the newsreels, and the photos are
  incredibly valuable and terribly interesting- especially if
  you're a history buff. I'd rank this one right up there with
  Hotel Terminus.</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">My 2 yr old daughter has been watching the

  got this and the second she saw it come in the mail she was
  running around the house excited, not able to wait for her 5 yr
  old brother to get home to watch it. She has all the Little
  Eistein movies except for the one that has the ones from the tv
  show. She watches them almost everyday and loves when she gets a
  new one. These are great movies for little kids to learn. She has
  be larger vocabulary then most 2 yr olds. Little Einstein is a
  great way for children to learn about a variety of things before
  they start school.</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">One could review Kingdom of Heaven on a lot
  of levels ... as an action packed medieval adventure/romance ...
  as a vehicle for some of your favorite actors ... or as a
  statement about humanity's less than perfect attempts to find
  spiritual meaning in life in a way that doesn't lead to warfare
  with people of differing points of view. I was expecting mostly
  the first two ... and was pleasantly surprised to find a
  reasonable amount of the third. My favorite quote from the movie
  summed up a powerful feeling I've had about spirituality for some
  time now: "God will understand, my lord. And if he doesn't, then
  he is not God and we need not worry." Why people so infrequently
  ask themselves whether the god they believe in really makes sense
  to their hearts or not, I don't know. And when I heard these
  words coming from the screen, I realized "someone out there
  understands ... we don't find God in books or doctrine or sermons
  ... we know God in our hearts, or not at all". This character
  looked to his heart and knew ... God will understand ... and
  anyone who doesn't is surely not God, no matter what someone else
  might claim. And if you loved the movie, you'll enjoy this DVD
  ... it's a classy widescreen handling of a film that's visually
  rich and deserves to be seen in it's cinematic format. With
  gorgeous scenery and delightful characters and costuming, I can't
  imagine watching such a visually appealing film in less than wide
  screen form.</Text>

  <Text category="dvd">Wow!!! I bought this set a couple of months
  ago and I've been watching each episode little by little, and
  enjoying each one of them a lot!!! It's interesting to watch
  Captain Scarlet again, thirty-something years after the last time
  I watched it back in the late 60s (when I was 7 or 8 years old)!
  I was (and still am) a huge fan of the "Thunderbirds" and became
  quite delighted when this new series from Gerry Anderson first
  appeared on TV back in the 60s! The quality of Captain Scarlet's
  special effects obviously got better since the Thunderbirds, and
  it really makes a huge difference (as far as realism is
  concerned) to have the marionettes more realistically
  proportioned! So much so, that there are times when you can
  almost forget that they are marionettes! The production still
  looks fabulous after all these years! The design of vehicles,
  machines, personal equipment, weapons, buildings, etc. is quite
  enjoyable, interesting and sometimes even surprising! The
  "Angels" (both airplanes and pilots) still manage to look
  amazingly sharp and contemporary!!! Perhaps only the automobiles
  give you a hint of the series real age, for they look quite dated
  indeed! However, now it seems a bit funny to see 1965 Chrysler
  and Ford lookalikes among the futuristic modernism of the series!
  Thirty-something years later, most of the episodes plots seem a
  bit shallow, almost stupid! But one has to remember that this
  series was meant for children! So, once you remember this you'll
  be ready to have a great time watching Captain Scarlet and his
  fellow Spectrum buddies fight the evil Mysterons (led by the
  sinister looking Captain Black), just as you did when you were
  still a child! Spectrum is green!!!...Enjoy it!!</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">I was like the previous reviewer. I had
  rented it and after watching it the first time, purchased it
  before I had even returned the rental! I loved the content, it
  gives one hope and a small glimpse into what lies beyond our
  human experience. How lovely to know that there is a life we can
  barely imagine, waiting to be returned to. And I didn't learn
  this fact from the video, I have been studying this subject for
  many years and already believe, no I KNOW, that there is more
  that lies beyond this brief stay on Earth. This video illustrates
  it so beautifully with people who have had a glimpse into that
  wonderful place that is our true Home. People who are dying yet
  unafraid as they are being shown what is yet to come. My own
  Mother saw her Mother as she died. She came to take her Home.
  There is no specific religion addressed here, only the fact that
  there is more to life than living and dying. And that it is
  something to be totally unafraid of. In fact physical death is
  only the beginning of something great; it is a step in the
  evolution of our souls</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">My sister and I loved this show growing up
  (The Huxtables reminded us of our extended family!) The episode
  where Stevie Wonder came on was our favorite and one of the best
  episodes (in my opinion). ..I do question why in Amazon's list of
  actors at the top of the page (for the Season 2 set)...Joseph C.
  Philips is the only one listed. Although he was a guest at one
  point he did not become a regular till much later. Regardless,
  this is a great collection and a must for Cosby fans.</Text>

  <Text category="dvd">Wow, how nice to watch Sam Cooke's story
  from beginning to end. Interviews with the family adds a wealth
  of inside information. I never knew Sam's father was a Chicago
  minister and of course Sam was the younger one who surprised the
  family when he first sang! Unfortunate for music that his life
  was taken so early. After watching this DVD, I bought Sam Cooke
  music and surpised that some songs are songs I had no idea Sam
  wrote</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">This is the final season of Hogan's Heroes.
  Sgt. Kinchloe (Ivan Dixon) left the series in Season 5 and was

  <Text category="dvd">I really enjoyed this DVD. The instructor is
  very charismatic, unlike most instructional videos. He really
  knows his stuff. The only reason I wouldn't give it 5 stars is
  because I don't believe that any DVD or video can really train a
  person to play an instrument. It comes from personal experience,
  not formula</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">I echo most of the previous reviews. This
  Hayley Mills vehicle has little to do with the excellent Mary
  Stewart novel that it shares some of its title with. Hayley was
  too young to be the novel's heroine, and so for this film the
  plot and romance were 'youthened', sanitized (though the novel's
  romance was also chaste) and also very much dumbed down. As a
  featherweight Hayley Mills film, this is harmless, and very much
  a lesser- Disney film of the 60s. Just don't expect this to be
  more than it is and you might enjoy it, even with your kids of
  today, as a retro laugh</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">In 2 weeks, I will actually be at the
  Vatican for my first visit.This wonderful DVD showed me places
  and things that I will never be able to see as a tourist, but
  just knowing about the workings of the Vatican will add such a
  richness of knowledge to visit. This is a beautifully done 90 min
  DVD as only National Geographic could have done. I was thrilled
  with every minute I spent watching it and will enjoy watching it
  many more time when I get home --- to remember my trip.</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">What can a single lie do? That is the
  question that is examined in Lillian Hellman's The Children's
  Hour. Martha (Shirley Maclaine) and Karen (Audrey Hepburn) run a
  small boarding school in a small New England town. Karen is
  engaged to a local doctor (James Garner). When Karen punishes a
  malicious student, the little girl decides to get revenge. The
  way the girl does this is repeat a out of context statement made
  by Martha's aunt (Miriam Hopkins). To complicate matters, she
  blackmails another girl (Veronica Cartwright) into confirming the
  story. This lie immediately destroys the Martha and Karen's
  school. But their life's are destroyed soon thereafter when their
  slander suit is rejected. But when the lie exposed it is too
  little too late. When the play opened in the late 50's it was
  daring and very controversial. When the film opened in 1961, it
  was still controversial. But 40 years later, it is not the
  lesbian story line that is interesting but how little has
  changed. Hepburn gives her usual excellent performance and would
  have gotten an Oscar nomination if she hadn't made Breakfast at
  Tiffany's that year. Shirley Maclaine was fresh off her success
  in The Apartment and was ready to stretch her dramatic legs. She
  proved that she could handle drama just as well as comedy. But it
  would be 15 years for her to get another great dramatic role (The
  Turning Point). Fay Bainter and Miriam Hopkins were major
  character actors in the 30's and 40's and were given one final
  chance to show what they had left. Bainter received an Oscar
  nomination for this film. William Wyler had nothing to prove in
  the 60's yet he continued to select great films with bite that
  featured women in strong roles. This was another triumph for him.
  DVD EXTRAS: NONE</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">With the flip of a coin , it's home I go.
  Ichi returns to the town he was raised as a child only to find
  that much has changed since he last left. A good film in the
  series I gave it five stars because I am bias and think that they
  all deserve five. This one was a strong introduction into Ichi's
  personal life along with the background of villians and lost
  ruffians with little or no way to reedeem their karma. Of course
  the cane sword is revealed yet again which leads to some good
  gore. I thought this was an all around good story with lots of
  underlying plays on greed and deception, and above all ,love
  ,shame and guilt from Ichi whom never seems to want to be
  bothered after it all goes down. Much is lost to our friend Ichi
  and he seems to just lose more.</Text>

  <Text category="dvd">Many, many years ago when I was a very young
  woman, I saw my first Carry On movie and went to see every one I
  could possibly get to. Then, there were none. Several years ago,
  my sister taped a copy of Carry On Cleo for me. I couldn't
  believe I still roared at the silliness only the Brits can
  successfully pull off. It must have been fate that led me to look
  up "Carry On" on amazon a few months ago. My heart skipped a beat
  when The Carry On Collection came up. I instantly made it mine
  and have watched most movies several times. My personal
  favorites: Carry On Constable, Carry On Cowboy, and Carry On
  Cabby. But they are all good. I've loaned several movies to a
  Brit here in the office who has seen all 27-something of the
  Carry On series and who is now introducing them to his American
  family. They love them, too. If you love double-entendre done to
  perfection, don't miss this collection</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">My whole family (ages 7-68) greatly enjoyed
  all the Horatio Hornblower movies together. They are well made

  Napoleonic Wars. It gives the viewers a real sense of how highly
  held personal honor and integrity used to be. We can't wait for
  A&amp;amp;E to continue the series</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">Together with 'Odyssey Into the Minds Eye',
  two of my favorite DVDs in my collection. They may be watched
  forever because the constant change of images and inventions

  this flow of beautiful worlds and mind conceptions</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">One of the warmest, most pleasantly
  lip-smacking film's ever! Made by a guy with a super-sized heart,
  AMERICA is a joyous celebration of the burger, and the down-home

  Take it from someone who has the HAMBURGER AMERICA poster hanging
  up - this little treasure is a home library essential</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">Alec Baldwin has always been the best host
  of SNL (along with Walken and Spacey) and this makes a pretty
  good case why. The opening sketch with the press conference about
  Prince Charles is priceless. And what could be more demented than
  "Canteen Boy." Baldwin is so over-the-top in that that what is a
  really, really sick joke is actually funny. But the home runs
  come with three of the funniest sketches of all time: The Tony
  Bennet Show (I was seizing during this one), The Joe Pesci Show
  (with Baldwin doing DeNiro) and the "Zinger" sketch, which just
  got funnier as it went along. Even better was the voicemail
  sketch where he keep re-recording his greeting, only to listen
  back to it and hear a gay man. There are a couple of clunkers:
  "Planet Truth" was just not that funny and maybe two others
  didn't need to be here. Including one so-so opening monologue
  that probably was only included because it included Paul
  McCartney. The bonus features include one great sketch that never
  made it on-air, and a great audio track by Baldwin and the
  Producer of SNL which provides lots of really, really
  entertaining stories about the cast and the sketches themselves.
  Absolutely hilarious</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">Alec Baldwin is tied with John Goodman for
  the second highest appearing host of all time. So it's only
  natural that he now has a best of DVD. This is not the best SNL
  DVD, but it is still a VERY good one. If you already have the
  best of Dana Carvey, Mike Myers, Steve Martin, and Tom Hanks...
  get this one next. This DVD has a couple of not-so-good skits,
  but it makes up for every one. There are a lot of hilarious skits
  on the DVD. I'm not going to list them, but just trust me. Anyone
  who gives this less than four stars is OUT OF THEIR MIND. When I
  first saw that the Best of Alec Baldwin was out I didn;t have to
  give it a second thought. It was at the top of my list, and it
  should be at the top of yours too.</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">I have now seen about twenty Asian horror
  films, and this series definitely ranks among the best. I have
  written more extensive reviews under the individual titles, but
  suffice it to say that these movies make Audition look like a
  Disney romance. Bleak, bizarre, and ultra violent, yet
  surprisingly stylish and intelligent. This film maker has
  something to say, and will beat you senseless to make his point.
  In short, if you want to see Ringu #25, stay away from this one.
  If you feel a bit more adventurous, I highly recommend this
  series</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">I have watched this film on my local PBS
  station at least 1/2 dozen times because it is soooooo good. I
  have a mental vacation each time. I find that my stress just goes
  away while watching this awe inspiring movie. I HIGHLY recommend
  this film for the whole family</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">I really loved this dvd. There is some
  information for everybody, beginners as well as advanced. There
  is also a nice presence from Paul himself who does not hestitate
  to retrace the painful and private premices of this album. I was
  not necessarily a huge fan of his music and knew absolutely
  nothing of his personnal life and of his method in composing.
  This dvd, without being too personnal, made me discover the
  craftmanship of the composer and the depth of the man. I also
  enjoyed the discovery of the South-African music, their
  traditions and influence as described by some of the musician of
  that country. The many footages of the countryside were a
  pleasure, which worked perfectly with "Graceland" songs. The
  anecdotes are meaningful, witty, funny, deep, depending on the
  situation. None of them self-indulgent or egotistical. This DVD
  is a truly great journey with one of the most influential folk
  composer's. I would rank this DVD up there with "The Clash, West
  way to the world" and "U2, the making of the Joshua tree".</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">This was my first yoga cd and i found it
  amazing ... i'm addicted to it. I still cant tell whether its
  challenging for advanced yogis but as a beginner I really enjoyed
  it.... it does NOT have all that gibberish spiritual blab on one
  extreme nor power yoga that seems to really be pseudoyoga on the
  other extreme .. however this CD is just clear and to the point
  with good instruction excellent demonstration and fantastic sound
  tracks.... eric's voice is soothing the instructions are clear
  and the crew is great. the length is convenient 45 minutes and
  music is hypnotic. the more i use it the more i feel stronger
  increase flexibility, breathe more calmly and improve my

  <Text category="dvd">In my 1-3-2007 review of the Harry Potter
  DVD series, I said about Alfonso Cuar&#239;&#191;&#189;n's
  direction of Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban that
  "perhaps Cuar&#239;&#191;&#189;n held back from doing his own
  thing" because Chris Columbus had directed the previous Harry
  Potter releases and had oversight to Azkaban. Well the notion
  that Cuar&#239;&#191;&#189;n was holding back in his Potter
  directorial was confirmed in my mind after seeing Children of
  Men. Cuar&#239;&#191;&#189;n can indeed make a great movie and
  could have made Azkaban great...but it was just good. Greatness
  clearly shines through when Cuar&#239;&#191;&#189;n is turned
  loose with "his own" film, and Children of Men is a good example.
  Children of Men is full of social and political themes as well as
  an abundance of messages of faith. And this is apparently what
  Cuar&#239;&#191;&#189;n does best (see 2001 directorial of Oscar
  nominated Y Tu Mam&#239;&#191;&#189; Tambi&#239;&#191;&#189;n).
  In Children of Men almost 20 years have passed since the last
  human baby was born. The result? Chaos. Clearly the end of the
  World is near. Zombies might as well have taken over the Earth,
  and it was that zombie movie (you know, the good ones, like 28
  Days Later [2002] or Dawn of the Dead [2004]) desperation that I
  was reminded of throughout Children of Men.
  Cuar&#239;&#191;&#189;n adapts P.D. James' 1992 novel to the big
  screen with several liberties, but keeps the message pretty much
  the same. The story is believably told, and the movie keeps an
  exciting pace all the way through. Clive Owen leads the cast, and
  this guy just gets better and better in every film that I see him
  in. He's supported by Julianne Moore, Michael Caine and a bunch
  of other actors that all turn in A-list performances. A fair
  amount of action. Suspense. A very well-told story....Everything
  that you need to keep you entertained. And, hey, did they
  actually keep the runtime to less than two hours for Children of
  Men? You don't get that too often anymore.</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">For those of you who only saw the new film
  last year (I bought it with this sight unseen because it looked
  interesting and it allowed me to get my favorite free shipping
  deal) here's your chance to see the Original stories of Flicka
  and her son Thunderhead. These 3 films which I am told are pretty
  faithful to Mary O'Hara's novels of the same titles (I have them
  too but never read them). The main difference between them and
  the 2006 remake is that is the central character is named "Ken
  (rather thank Katy McLaughlin", well at least the kept the same
  name in the remake) and is played by a young Roddy McDowell in
  the first 2 films and Robert Arthur in the third. The reason he
  probably didn't do "Green Grass" is that the same year (1948) he
  was making the second big screen version of Robert Louis
  Stevenson's Kidnapped. The first film was released on VHS years
  ago, and both the first 2 had been previously released on DVD to
  celebrate their 60th anniversaries. Unfortunately those discs are
  out of print, albeit some Amazon sellers are still offering them
  separately or together. But the copies in this set are exactly
  the same discs, except for the pictures on the jackets and the
  labels on the discs. The text on the back of the boxes and list
  of chapter stops (on the lists and discs) are exactly the same as
  the previous releases. This is also the only way to get all 3 (if
  you don't count the old copies) as only the first film has been
  re-released as a separate item (it also marks the first
  appearance of "Green Grass" on video in any way, shape or form).
  By the way, it was also made into the a short lived tv series in
  1956 which I doubt we will ever see again. If you like the books
  and movies of Anna Sewell's Black Beauty and Walter Farley's
  Black Stallion and the 2006 remake interests (or interested you),
  get this set before they go out of print again.</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">I have waited years for this release to be
  laser scribed onto DVD--it is here! A very good movie. I have to
  say the Inspector Carson (belonging to an unknown federal
  agency), character played by Kurtwood Smith is good if not great
  acting. He epitomizes the sort of corrupt fellow we all love to
  hate. His lines in the movie (particularly when he and Border
  Patrol Agent Bobby Logan, Kris Kristofferson) discuss 'politics'
  during a stakeout are sheer unadulterated cynicism at the
  nuttiest best. The conspiracy flakes have probably adopted these
  lines as their mantra.... Great bit part acting by Rip Torn,
  Roberts Blossom (as the desert rat), Tess Harper and the young
  and sultry Jean Smart. Kris Kristofferson does a great job with
  his lines and acting capacity and Treat Williams does ok as well.
  Anyone who has been in law enforcement--or any other supervisory
  capacity for that matter--has seen the idiocy and vacuum
  headedness of the supervisor depicted in the movie of the Border
  Patrol: Totally inept. The soundtrack by Tangerine Dream is one
  of my all time favorites because it fits the movie seamlessly and
  draws you into the scenes. A must see movie.</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">I love this old documentary...Capt Clark
  Gable does an excellent job narrating it, the color footage is a
  rare treat, and it gives an excellent insight into the day-to-day
  lives of those from the greatest generation. It is a real tribute
  to all the men who flew bombers in WWII and we need to remember
  their service and sacrifices. They fought a tougher war and
  sustained much greater losses than we have in Iraq or
  Afghanistan, plus they were gone for much longer periods and
  didn't have the technology such as email or video
  teleconferencing to keep in touch with their loved ones. We need
  to remember them, as we are losing them quickly and soon they may
  all be gone. But their legacy remains, and it is films like this
  one that preserves it</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">Any Sam Kinison fan needs to own this DVD or
  video. You get 2 of Sam's HBO specials plus many special stand up
  features and Sam's home movies. The only reason I did not give
  this box set a 5 star rating is the fact that in the first
  special feature called: rare stand up(I love the special features
  on DVDs), Sam told many jokes that were already on the HBO
  special. Other than that, Sam's comedy is unlike anything you
  will see today. He will really be thought of as a comedy legend.
  These DVD's will crack you up. I would recomend buying the Sam
  Kinison CDs, Live From Hell, and Have you seen me lately? The
  Cd's(just listen to them in your car or at home) will give you
  the complementary material you need(plus the HBO specials) to
  truely love Sam Kinison. He is one of the best, and you will be
  satisfied with with any purchase. Just buy 1 CD or DVD and you
  will be hooked</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">Having only seen Seinfeld's series on TV
  that goes by the same name, it was great to have the opportunity
  to see him as a stand up comedian on DVD. I'd never seen the DVD
  before, but some of the material sounded familiar... Perhaps it
  overlaps with some of the opening and closing live gags that are
  shown on the Seinfeld show? You may notice that in his speel
  about the Chinese he lets the word "shovel" out too soon (when
  talking about the Chinese's perseverance with chopsticks), and
  thus spoils the joke a little bit. But Seinfeld is obviously a
  master of ad lib, so he managed to work around it. A thoroughly
  recommendable DVD</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">The scene where Eric Idle whines "Oh, you're
  no fun anymore!" is a deceptive one. If anything, these guys are
  even more fun than before. The second half of Monty Python's
  Flying Circus's first season is even more polished and mad than
  the first, continuing the tradition of short skits focused on
  complete insanity. In these episodes, we have: a serial-killer
  barber; lecherous art critics; an unfortunate man who tries to
  eat a cathedral, tunnel to Java and jump the English channel; Ken
  Shabby, every girl's dad's nightmare; thuggish old ladies;
  bloodthirsty librarians who want to hire a gorilla;
  camel-spotting; and prime ministers falling through the earth's
  crust. The longest and most bizarre skit is one where people
  mysteriously start turning into Scotsmen and streaming north of
  the border. Soon "Scotland will be choked with SCOTSMEN," and
  England is pretty much abandoned. The culprits: tennis-playing,
  human-devouring blancmanges from the galaxy of Andromeda. And, of
  course, the stuff that has become comedy legend: the scene where
  John Cleese tries to return a dead parrot to a pet store ("It's a
  stiff! Bereft of life, it rests in peace!"), and the Lumberjack
  Song ("I cut down trees. I skip and jump/I like to press wild
  flowers/I put on women's clothing/And hang around in bars...").
  Of course, no mere description can do justice to the comic
  brilliance of these dozens of skits. These five Brits (and one
  American, who did the little cartoons) created some of the most
  unabashed, naughty, nasty, and just plain weird comedy ever,
  which still influences everything from Saturday Night Live to
  author Jasper Fforde. And all of this by men who often dress up
  as the world's most unattractive girls, with only a tiny budget
  and minimal cast. The 70s production values are omnipresent, and
  they are decidedly unpolitically correct. But in a weird way,
  these only make it even funnier than it would have been otherwise
  -- the writing and acting are pure, raw, unrefined comedy.
  Probably the most memorable actors here are Cleese and Idle.
  Cleese does his psychotic shrieks better than anyone, as well as
  having that rubbery lanky body and howling monkey voice. And Eric
  Idle does a good job as everyone from a housewife to a wannabe
  mountain climber, while Michael Palin does a brilliant job as
  people who are timid or insane. By this point, the Monty Python
  guys had polished up their skits and reached a steady plateau of
  comic brilliance. In other words, it's funny and should be
  watched</Text>

  Joel Allen Bruce Cowling ... Operations officer During World War
  II the British Royal Air Force maintained nighttime bombing raids
  over Europe, while the United States Army Air Corps made large
  daylight raids. Since the Air Corps was clearly visible, their
  losses were heavy. American fighter cover did not have sufficient
  range to accompany the bombers, mainly the B-17
  &amp;amp;quot;Flying Fortresses,&amp;amp;quot; mainly from the
  Eighth Air Force, all the way to their German targets and back,
  which made them highly vulnerable. We lost 50,000 men in the air
  over Europe during that war. This is the fictional story of some
  of the men who fought that air war. Brig. Gen. K.C. 'Casey'
  Dennis (Clark Gable) is in command of a bomber division composed
  of several groups attempting to destroy the aircraft plants in
  Germany that are producing the Messerschmidt 262 jet fighter (the
  first operational jet fighter in the Second World War). The
  German jet was much faster and better armed than our P-51
  'Mustang', P-47 'Thunderbolt', or P-38 'Lightning', our three
  best escort fighters, and was causing massive losses in the air.
  Dennis was obstructed by higher ranking generals who were worried
  about the reaction of the politicians and newsmen who were
  reporting the high losses to the American public. The course of
  the war was, indeed, in reality, affected by just such
  considerations, as it is in every war. This is a far better film,
  and reflected the reality of that particular war far better than
  I expected. I appreciated it. It was a well-acted, well motivated
  drama. Joseph (Joe) Pierre author of Handguns and Freedom...their

  <Text category="dvd">The real life base (Dr. Li Ching-Yun,
  1677-1933) adds to the wonder and mystery. Many movies usually
  pale compared to the book; however this movie fits all the
  criteria of a great classic. Such as excellent film footage for
  the time, even though some scenes are missing. When I look at the
  Shangri-La setting some times my mind wanders and I wonder if
  this was the idea behind the valley in the book "Atlas Shrugged"
  by Ayn Rand? I doubt that they could have picked any better
  actors for the parts. These actors fit the time and surroundings
  and were actually believable in the characters they played. A
  later remake of this movie was o.k. But just did not have the
  presence of these actors. Now the DVD features: Digitally

  <Text category="dvd">...that you simply HAVE to see, "Mrs
  Miniver" being one, a little known film dealing with a fictitious
  German invasion to a sweet English Village, "Went the day well?"
  and this film. Why so? Because all 3 were made at the start of
  the war (early 40's) when England stood very much alone in the
  fight agaisnt Hitler and aggresive facism. Invasion fears were
  rife, the war effort looked hopeless at times as in Europe,
  Hitler opposing country after country fell to the German
  aggressors (not to mention the rampage going on in Africa at the
  hands of Rommel aided by the Italian forces under Mussolini's
  instruction). England's small island identity stood alone and
  under threat and was bombed, starved and demoralised into feeling
  invasion could happen any day. It was quite possibly the darkest
  of times in English History and these three films capture the
  flavour of that dispondancy but equally the might of the will to
  survive and protect, with realistic perfection. In which we serve
  does this more personally as we know it is based in truth and the
  characters become dear and well rounded quite quickly, inspiring
  us to care about these folk from many walks of British life. For
  a modern audience it may seem a little over stoic and sentimental
  at times but place the emotion in context of the year it was made
  (1942), and I guarantee you will view it an aching sense of fear
  and hope which was precisely Coward's plan. An absolute gem and a
  must see, I weep every time I watch it</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">You might think from the title and the
  commercials this movie is about a super sexy porn star slut...but
  it's actually the opposite. I really liked how the movie was done
  to portray the struggles some girls really have to go through in
  their carrers and mixed it with the toughness of high school.
  This is definately a movie i would reccomend to people over like
  16 but only if you want to watch a funny movie about the
  discovering and strength of two people...This movie is the real
  thing, i enjoyed it and i think many other people could
  too</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">If you can't get enough of zombie comedies
  this year, I seriously recommend this one, made in the Czech
  Republic of all places! I saw it at the Tribeca Film Festival
  (NY) and it was tremendous fun. Bloody, funny, and smart. An
  intellectual twist on the "secluded retreat" idea - a group
  gathers at a hotel to do a weekend course about the meaning of
  their lives. And of course, they're overrun by zombies. I
  especially love the way the film weaves between existential
  exploration and hilarious gore-fest. It works on so many
  different levels - while your first reaction to it may be mostly
  visceral, your attention will soon shift to the clever jokes, the
  interesting characters, and the joyful way it plays with film
  conventions. This is a rare and unusual film to come out of the
  Czech Republic. I was disappointed that it didn't get a
  theatrical release in the US, so I'm really glad that it's coming
  out on DVD. Humor/horror fans will not be disappointed!</Text>

  <Text category="dvd">The Cutting Edge is one of those break out
  feel good movies you can watch anytime and it's still as much fun
  today as the first time I saw it in 1992. "Doug Dorsey" played
  with verve by D.B. Sweeney, is a rising hockey star with a bright
  future ahead him until a freak accident on the ice shatters his
  chances of playing at the peak of the competitive level. It's not
  long before Doug is noticed by skating coach "Anton Pamchenko"
  Roy Dotrice, an affable personality whom the audience gravitates
  to from the start. Pamchenko brings Mr.Dorsey to the estate of
  Kate Moseley, Moira Kelly, a would-have been gold medalist at the
  1984 Winter Games in Sarajevo. She blamed her former partner for
  their loss and never fully recovered, you see. Kate has an
  acerbic tongue that's as sharp as her blades. She has issues
  welcoming a new partner and Doug is no exeception. The two meet
  and a hostile alliance is soon formed as they begin practice
  sessions. Doug isn't used to figure skates and Kate takes full
  advantage of this by "missing" serveral connections in the
  routines which cause him to painfully contact the ice. Each time
  he falls, Kate skates by teasing him uttering "Toe pick." One of
  my favorite scenes in the movie. Doug is made of quite stern
  stuff and soon turns the tables on Kate in a harmless way during
  an impromtu "hockey game" played on her private indoor rink.
  Having ironed out the roughness, the two become quite polished
  and a budding romance ensues between them. The question is, do
  they have what it takes to become 1988 Olympic Champions in pairs
  figure skating? The acting is charming and the soundtrack first
  rate.I would have given it five stars except for the ending,
  which I won't give away here. Buy the DVD &amp;amp; CD, you won't
  be dissappointed</Text>

  <Text category="dvd">This is one of the great biopic films ever
  made. More often than not, film biopics are too rushed. They try
  and squeeze in every aspect of their subjects lives, and they end
  up giving short shrift to the person and their lives. This is not
  one of those films. It just covers Woody Guthrie's adult life,
  from when he hit the road to when he became a big time folk
  singer, and his passionate defense of the working man. The look
  of the film is deliberate, in that it's washed out. The hoedown
  scenes at the camp are some of the best in the film. They're
  really lively, where the extras and everyone seem to be really
  enjoying themselves. The film has a real genuine feel to it, like
  you're actually watching real people. David Carradine is amazing
  as Woody Guthrie. He makes you think you're actually watching
  Woody himself. He did his own singing and stuntwork on the film.
  Ronny Cox is excellent as well, and he does his own singing too
  (remember, Cox played the man who jammed with the hillbilly in
  Deliverance). Randy Quaid and Melinda Dillon offer great
  supporting roles as well. This is a fabulous film, and it feels
  short at 2 1/2 hours.</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">First of all, let me tell you, this is NOT a
  date movie. This is the most brutal graphic rape movie I have
  ever seen, and also one that lingers in your mind long after it
  is over. For me, that's exactly what I want when I see a movie,
  one that leaves a lasting impression no matter how difficult the
  impression might be. I loved this movie, because it is very very
  well made, and the acting performances are incredible. Yes, the
  rapes are unforgiving in every respect, and the misery throughout
  the film is almost difficult to watch at times. This is not a
  gory movie, except for the last ten minutes, it is a very
  disturbing movie and it does have a fair amount of nudity,
  however it really needs to. "The Untold Story" and "Ebola
  Syndrome" offset much of the carnage with humor, but "Red to
  Kill" has absolutely NOTHING to smile about. It is totally and
  brutally serious from the first frame to the extremely nasty
  ending. The story is pretty simple, a psycho-rapist is on the
  loose and he's going after a mentally retarded young dancer. In
  the second graphic rape of the movie he does the deed to the
  young lady. Enter a female social worker who tries to help the
  victim, and dreams up a plan to get even with the rapist after he
  gets off in court because of a stupid technicality. Her plan
  succeeds to a certain extent, but not like she planned it, and
  the rapist comes after her full force. The actor who plays the
  rapist is absolutely sensational, and I might add, the musical
  score is perfect. The music adds so much to the all ready
  existing tension from all the horrific acts. The actress who
  plays the retarded girl is also amazing, one of the best
  performances on film you will ever see. To end this, this is a
  must-see movie for fans of this genre, and I'm just getting
  started myself. Not the gore associated with the two previous Cat
  III movies I watched, but something even more terrible and
  unrelenting, and an uneasy feeling that will not leave you
  anytime soon after you see it. "Red to Kill" is flatout a good
  movie, even considering the subject matter. I highly recommend
  it</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">Hard to believe it took me until now
  (February 2007) to finally see this excellent movie and witness
  the brutal language and the violent gun shootings that made
  Scarface so popular and award-deserving back in the early 80's. I
  loved this movie. It really delivers with the action and the
  characters are all interesting, especially Tony Montana. A movie
  that deserves to be as lengthy as it is (over 2 hours). Everyone
  must see Scarface at least once in their lifetime. It won't
  disappoint. The ending gave me goosebumps it was *that* good and
  intense. Watch it now</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">I loved this show and have been waiting for
  it to come out on something so I could watch the episodes
  again...I can't wait for season two to come out. If you were a
  fan of this show, you have to get it..</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">Why on earth am I giving this movie five
  stars? Its plot is minimal. The script has words and phrases I've
  never heard, and I'm not sure were ever really used in the real
  world. And to top that off, it's more than a little unbelievable.
  However, despite all of the possible downsides, I really enjoyed
  it. Honestly, I'm normally not into these kinds of films, but it
  was just good fun. The humor wasn't disgusting and gross. The
  chemistry between the actors made the on screen relationships
  believable (even if I don't ever buy the whole love at first
  sight scenario), and there wasn't some great moral constantly
  being shoved down my throat. All in all, it was just a fun movie
  to watch, and it's been a long time since a movie simply put a
  smile on my face</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">This is one of the best G3s. Maybe even the
  best. I would have said that it was definitely the best if not
  for Mr.Malmsteen - the nicest thing one can say about the latter
  is that he knows his minor and major scales. But *I* don't want
  to be nice. I want to be absolutely and unequivocally cruel when
  it comes to Malmsteen. He knows alternate picking, I'll give him
  that. But then, so do I - and a million others. He shouldn't be
  up there playing with Vai and Satriani solely because he can
  alternate pick faster than most (not all) people . And yet he is.
  He shows over and over again, in this show, that the only thing
  he can do with the guitar is shred and shred and shred some more.
  That's all. One of the interesting things about this DVD is that
  one cannot really measure the time between two consecutive
  shredding runs that Yngwie chooses to execute - it's less than
  about a second. And this is an *average* figure. Enough about
  Yngwie, though he is the reason I'm writing this review -
  Satriani is absolutely amazing, as usual, with a brand new
  rendition of 'Midnight' and a nice solo at the end of 'Starry
  Night'. Vai, though, steals the show. This coming from a guy who
  prefers Satriani. But I can't help it - he is really that good.
  And better. 'I Know You're Here'(which he plays on a triple neck
  Jem) contains at least seven new approaches to the same old
  things that you're taught at guitar school. It is also the best
  song Steve Vai has ever written after 'Fire Garden Suite'.
  'Juice' and 'I'm the Hell Outta Here' are also really really
  really good. Overall, a great DVD, though you should probably
  skip the parts with Yngwie in it</Text>

  <Text category="dvd">How good is Angelina Jolie in this film? It
  is a testament to this young actor's presence that even as dark
  and soul sickened and gloriously decaying as her character is,
  there is not a frame in this film that doesn't feel her
  infection. Winona Rider is equally excellent as the
  psychologically confused (or is it enlightened?) hero forced to
  navigate the depths of her own psyche. The interplay between
  these two is somehow able to range from the enchanting to the
  exquisitely painful; but from beginning to end remains capable of
  leaving you breathless. One look into Angelina Jolie's eyes and
  you will see the warm, jaundiced decay of a soul no longer
  battling with sanity. Fear is born of those eyes when you realize
  how strongly they've tempted your own tired efforts...even as the
  second look delves closer to a bleakness bearing fruition beyond
  existential suicide. Presented with the softly rendered and
  absorbing visualization of a young girl's decent into
  psychological insecurity; it is a hauntingly supple progression
  toward the half understood disturbance of what we might have
  experienced. James Mangold directed this film quite nicely from a
  very good screenplay; he managed to portray all these young women
  as young women in turmoil. No melodrama, no over the top
  sentimentality, just a frank peek into their tumultuous lives. If
  you've ever questioned your own sanity or escaped periods of
  exceptional melancholy in your life, this film is certain to
  trigger old fears. But it is also certain to remind you how
  exquisite and simple salvation can often be. This film deserves
  that second look, as well as its painful salvation: a jaundiced
  beauty whose tragic death is no less healing than the memory of a
  lost friend. It is a heavy drama, so be forewarned! And a very
  moving drama at that.</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">All the Danger man DVDs are excellent. The

  <Text category="dvd">I have to admit that I actually enjoyed this
  movie. I certainly liked it better than "Red Planet". I believe
  "Mission to Mars" to be the better of the two movies. It has a
  stellar cast and, I thought, good on screen chemistry between the
  actors. Most of the special effects were excellent. All in all,
  it is a good directorial effort by Brian De Palma. Somehow,
  however, this has become the movie that viewers love to hate.
  Well, I am afraid that I disagree, as I found it to be a pretty
  decent sci-fi move. Of course, I am partial to this genre of
  film, so perhaps that may account in part for my liking this
  movie. The premise of this movie is simple. A crew is sent on a
  mission to Mars. The mission is disrupted when three of the four
  crew members are killed by an unknown energy force emanating from
  a strange metallic composition in the soil. A new crew of four go
  on a rescue mission. These four, Tim Robbins, Connie Nielsen,
  Gary Sinise, and Jerry O'Connell, make up the rescue crew. Due to
  problems encountered in space, only three of the four make it to
  Mars. When they get to Mars, they find the surviving crew member.
  Debriefing him of the events that led to the destruction of the
  mission, they discover that the metallic composition in the soil
  is, in fact, a giant metallic head made in the image of man.
  Therein lies the mystery. What they eventually discover astounds
  them and makes one of them decide to go where no man has gone
  before. The ending is somewhat reminiscent of a combination of
  the movies, "2001: A Space Odyssey" and "Close Encounters of the
  Third Kind." So, I ask you, how bad can this movie be? On the
  contrary, it is actually pretty good. Better yet, it can be
  watched by the entire family</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">This is the 6th and last entry in the series
  Lone Wolf &amp;amp; Cub. This one not only has a different
  director than Kenji, who directed 4 of the others, this is the
  entry most like a comic-book (the series is based on a famous
  comic book series). Not that that is bad. The whole series
  fluctuated between great period detail, serious themes, and not
  taking itself too seriously. It was at once graphic and
  fantastic, realistic and wildly improbable, factual and
  imaginary. serious &amp;amp; silly. That's what made it so damn
  interesting. Throughout the series the action has taken place in
  different locales and landscapes of Japan. Tracing actual
  historical roads and cities. Now we end the series in the
  mountains and the snow, the White Heaven in Hell of the title.
  This entry has a lot of stuff going on: Lord Retsudo of the hated
  Yagyu Clan, Ogami's arch enemy, sends his last child, a daughter
  to do in Ogami with her "Falling Dagger" technique. When,
  predictably, she fails, he goes to an illegitimate son that was
  abandoned and raised by a mountain tribe. The downhill ski battle
  may not be quite as intense and exciting as the one in Her
  Majesties Secret Service, but it ain't bad. That Ogami's Baby
  Cart guns never seem to need reloading etc. are minor quibbles.
  If Ogami doesn't shoot em he always seems able to bifurcate them,
  behead them, or run em through. Red sprays all over the white
  snow. Anyway, they wind the series up with a bang. One of the
  strangest, most unique, and unusual series ever produced
  anywhere. Worth it if you don't mind the violence</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">I just saw this move for the first time in
  wide screen and it is a much different experience I must say. I
  think I have figured it out. In some other reviews I think
  Batricia Birch should have just stayed with the songs and the
  numbers. I think they should have got another director to get the
  rest of the movie off the ground. It is somewhat of a good story.
  I can see why it would be reversed (a guy trying to get the girl,
  instead of the other way around). You see Eugine in the beginning
  of the movie stumbling out of the bus. Well if he were a senior
  in the first one then why is he in the second one???? Also
  Frenchie is not with the Pink Ladies at all. You see her by
  herself or just briefly with the other pink ladies in school. I
  think the chemistry between Stephanie and Michael were worked
  well together. The songs were written by the same people that
  wrote the songs for the first movie. So really the bottom line is
  that they should have gotten a different director altogether. I
  know I know it is not the first one. But sequels are usually not,
  but they usually have connections to the first. Grease 2 tried to
  accomplish with Frenchie and the Tbirds, Pink ladies and all. I
  am glad they were able to have Eve Arden, Sid Ceaser, plus other
  great actors of the 50s and 60s like Tab Hunter. Is this movie
  cheesy???? Yes Is it done in less than expected direction????
  Yes. Does it have good songs?? Yes (Cool Rider, Reproduction,
  We'll Always be Together, Girl for all Seasons/Turn Back, and
  Back to School). The song skits themselves are good and with the
  same flavor of the first one. After all Kiddies, Patricia Birch
  did do the choreography for both. So, in closing, this movie made
  it to my DVD collection if for that reason alone. If Grease 2 is
  going to stink then let it reek. If it has its moments of good
  cute fun then let it have that. I think if you loved the first
  Grease then I think you should at least give this one a
  try.</Text>

  <Text category="dvd">When this show was on back in the day on Fox
  I couldnt believe I was actually watching something I could

  ask me when it was on. It was actually something that gave me
  some relief. I deal everyday with some experinces re-lated to the
  show. Its somewhat of a constant battle. Enough about me. Im
  really glad all 3 Seasons are out. And im also glad I didnt have
  to wait many years either. One thing I didnt like about Fox when
  Titus was on they kept moveing it around. It wasnt fair for the
  show. Then the next thing ya know there were some repeats then it
  was gone. Im not really happy with Fox cause Titus still should
  be on tv or had a much longer run then it did. I hope Chris shows
  up in something else soon. Hes got one of those faces ya never

  <Text category="dvd">This is a well-written, thoughtful film.
  Charlie Hunnam (Pete) really stands out to me - he's perfectly
  cast, compelling to watch, and completely sells the mentality of
  a devoted hometown fan who has the back of all his "mates." It
  was especially interesting to watch his relationship with Elijah
  Wood's character evolve. The whole concept of an American being
  immersed in the British football scene is a unique one and I
  think it was pulled off really well. The lessons that Elijah Wood
  learn and the ultimately sentimental tone of the film make this a
  must-see</Text>

  <Text category="dvd">In this cynical day and age, it's truly
  astonishing to see a band rise from the ashes and still sound
  relevant (not to mention amazing), but how often do you get to
  see the inside picture offstage? This film works as a eulogy to
  Arthur "Killer" Kane, a synopsis of the Dolls' early years, and a
  buoy for rock 'n' rollers lost at sea. It's all things to all
  people, but it's never boring or condescending. I would actually
  recommend this film to lovers of cinema, whether they had any
  knowledge of the Dolls or not, simply because it's a great story,
  well told, and stands up to repeated viewings.</Text>

  <Text category="dvd">This is a good introduction to many off the
  beaten paths of America. In fact, the real star of the show, asie
  from the ubiquitous red Ford Taurus, is the scenery of America
  itself. The camera and narrator takes the viewers to many places
  that have unique characteristics. Unfortunately there is no
  interaction with the locals so we do not get a truely complete
  coverage of each scene, but the point of the series is to give a
  "Reader's Digest" view of places people can visit. But excellent
  photography and the knack for finding out of the way events are
  the hallmark of this series. Each "trip" is actually a roundabout
  path that is really serveral "family vacations" combined into a
  one hour program. This is a great cure for cabin fever in the
  midst of a winter snowstorm</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">It's difficult to identify the exact
  pinnacle of Alfred Hitchcock's masterworks, especially as he had
  a most fruitful period during the 1950's until the 1960 classic
  "Psycho", but 1946's "Notorious" is arguably his most perfectly
  crafted and cast film. First, there is a sharp, intensely plotted
  script by the estimable Ben Hecht that focuses on Alicia
  Huberman, the daughter of a convicted Nazi spy, and T.R. Devlin,
  an American agent hired to convince Alicia to spy on a
  clandestine group of neo-Nazis based in Rio de Janeiro. This
  means she would have to seduce and eventually marry Alex
  Sebastian, a key group member who has never gotten over Alicia in
  his heart. This triangle is embodied by three stars at the height
  of their powers. A primarily poker-faced Cary Grant portrays
  Devlin close to the vest and charismatically hides his emotions
  under a veil of cold arrogance. In a series of scenes that pierce
  with a subverted eroticism, Devlin falls in love with Alicia but
  cannot find the courage to admit that to himself or to her.
  Claude Rains, on the other hand, imbues Sebastian with such an
  open romanticism and sad streaks of jealousy that we can actually
  sympathize with a Nazi war criminal a year after WWII ended,
  quite a daring feat within the film's historical context. At the
  vortex, though, is Ingrid Bergman, who probably gives her most
  accomplished performance as Alicia. At the time, she was deified
  as the chaste Mother Superior in Leo McCarey's harmless "The
  Bells of St. Mary's" with Bing Crosby. Bergman turned a smart
  corner here as a "loose" woman in love with the bottle until she
  is transformed by her love for Devlin, at which point, she
  becomes a stylish decoy to draw the na&#239;&#191;&#189;ve
  Sebastian to her alluring charms. Ethereally beautiful and
  constantly pained, she conveys much of her character's feelings
  through her eyes and subtle facial expressions because she and
  Grant portray two people who can't admit they desperately want to
  be together even if her life depends on it. Their failure to
  communicate leads to Alicia sinking deeper into the morass of
  some nasty espionage business that ultimately puts her life in
  jeopardy. The chemistry between the two legends is palpable,
  especially in the then-controversial, three-minute kissing
  sequence that put censors into a tizzy. However, above all, this
  is a Hitchcock film, the film is filled with his genius for
  ingenious subjective camerawork and suspenseful set pieces, the
  latter perfectly illustrated by the party sequence at Sebastian's
  mansion starting with an unbelievable dolly shot right into
  Alicia's hand clasping the cellar key, which she passes to Devlin
  to find what is being hidden in the wine bottles. There are
  intriguing performances on the sidelines with Louis Calhern as
  the head of the American agency in Rio and the intimidating
  Madame Konstantin as Alex's ice-cold mother, both displaying a
  Machiavellian spirit to get what they want. The Criterion
  Collection has done another masterful job with their DVD package,
  including an alternative audio commentary track featuring
  renowned Hitchcock scholar Marian Keane providing insightful
  scene-specific analysis and film historian Rudy Behlmer. As was
  common with movie hits of the day, the movie was recreated in
  condensed form for radio, and the 1948 Lux Radio theater
  adaptation starring the voices of Ingrid Bergman and Joseph
  Cotten is included as well. There are also lots of still photos,
  a collection of trailers and teasers, and even production
  correspondence and script excerpts of deleted scenes and
  alternate endings for the more anal-retentive among us. This is a
  true classic and required viewing for any fan of Hitchcock,
  Bergman, Grant or Rains</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">I found the film, "Malice" to be a very
  intriguing and interesting murder mystery. Sure, there are a lot
  of twist's in the film, however, that is what I found to be very
  good about this film. Especially the way these twist's were done.
  There will be no spoilers in this review. The film begin's with
  murders occuring in a small college town. Andy Safian (Bill
  Pullman) is a college dean who happens to be suspected of these
  killings. All circumstantial. Moreover, he is having problems
  with his wife (Nicole Kidman). Something happens to her, and she
  blames Andy for this. [To tell you would give away the film] It
  seems as if one of Andy's old school friends is now a practicing
  surgeon (Alec Baldwin). Therefore she decides to leave him and
  sues both the medical facility that caused her such grief, and
  the Doctor (Balwin) in particular who caused this grief to her.
  But there is more to the story than meets the eye. There are
  several stories going on at once. First, you have a serial
  killer, secondly you have a distraught wife (Kidman) blaming her
  ex-husband and his Doctor friend for what has happened to her.
  But there is more to her than the viewer suspect's. I will leave
  this to you to discover. The film is better than the reviews
  warrant. It is a very suspenseful film full of twists.

  <Text category="dvd">This is an amazing DVD. I read reviews
  online all the time saying "anyone will like this", but
  seriously. I even showed it to my mother who laughed. That's a
  big deal. This DVD follows these four comedians on their two week
  tour. Their nightly shows are spliced together with scenes of
  them in their bus on their way to that particular city. Also
  throughout the episodes, it shows the comedians in interviews
  discussing comedy in America during her "time of need",
  interpersonal relationships, and anything else they could think

  <Text category="dvd">I have always been a fan of movies that mix
  special effect animation with live action and the Mask is no
  exception. I would also have to say that the Mask is one of a
  kind in terms of unique films. There are many good things about
  this film aside from the well written script and good acting but
  I think the one thing that shines the most about the Mask is the
  special effects and the humor that goes along with it. For those
  of you who don't know, a big portion of the effects and humor
  from this movie stem from the old Tex Avery cartoons such as
  droopy the dog and the lone wolf who lusts after the nightclub
  dancer in a red dress (this feature is shown in the bonus section
  of the dvd). These kind of cartoons were always my favorite
  growing up aside from looney tunes. Getting back on the subject,
  what I also found thrilling about the Mask is how well the dog
  Milo was trained to perform certain task. If you have seen this
  movie, you know what I'm talking about. The training of the dog
  is also shown in the bonus section of the dvd. The movie itself
  was a take-off of the comic series of the Mask. Though not quite
  as dark as the comics, the film itself managed to portray enough
  adult humor and semi-violence so that the Mask would not be
  deemed as a children's film hence the PG-13 rating. A big plus to
  the Mask was how Jim Carrey portrayed the different character
  traits of Stanley Ipkis and Stanley Ipkis wearing the mask.
  Another big plus about this movie is the main villain getting
  hold of the mask. And of course, who can dislike Ben Stein's
  typical character of a monotone man with sarcastic remarks? Oh,
  and Cameron Diaz is an absolute babe in this movie as well. As
  for the dvd, this re-release is an improvement from the previous.
  You get 5.1 surround sound along with a crisp widescreen picture.
  The added bonus features are also great and should be viewed to
  appreciate what was put in to making this movie</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">good actors, great story... some good action

  case, there's more truth than not in this version of the

  <Text category="dvd">This film i have to say is beautiful
  looking, from the characters to the landscape. Although lacking
  in numerous and long fight scenes, it does keep things
  interesting with matrix like effects. The only problem is the
  love between the two main characters . The movie never lets you
  feel the love between them , and the girl seems always distant
  about the love anyway i mean it is called heart under blade
  right? The main ninja character has the coolest power and he
  always seems troubled to use them it. This film is more of a
  drama sprinkled with ninja action and beautiful visuals!</Text>

  <Text category="dvd">'Torz&#239;&#191;&#189;k' ('Abandoned') is a
  brilliant Hungarian film written and directed by
  &#239;&#191;&#189;rp&#239;&#191;&#189;d Sopsits that takes us
  back to Hungary of 1960 when the oppressive Communist rule
  altered the lives of everyone, especially children. The quality
  of the film is absolutely first rate from story to acting to
  filming to scoring. It may be a tough film to absorb and
  certainly not for the easily offended, but it is a perfectly
  honed gem of a film that deserves wide audience exposure.
  &#239;&#191;&#189;ron (Tam&#239;&#191;&#189;s
  M&#239;&#191;&#189;sz&#239;&#191;&#189;ros) is a young lad whose
  life seems warm at first until suddenly a disease of vision
  impairment attacks his mother and his parents divorce: the mother
  is somewhere in a hospital and the father
  (S&#239;&#191;&#189;ndor
  G&#239;&#191;&#189;sp&#239;&#191;&#189;r) beats the boy and
  eventually turns him over to a rigid orphanage for boys run by
  cruel taskmasters. &#239;&#191;&#189;ron undergoes initiation
  tactics by his fellow orphans but despite the beatings he is
  strong enough to survive. He is befriended when he has his
  nightmares about his mother's blindness by his friend Atilla
  (Szabolcs Csizmadia) and the two bond emotionally and physically.
  In this bleak atmosphere a little light comes from the beautiful
  young housekeeper Anya (Krisztina Somogyi) but even her
  contributions are compromised by the cruelty of the staff. There
  is one 'teacher' in the orphanage school, Nyitrai
  (L&#239;&#191;&#189;szl&#239;&#191;&#189;
  G&#239;&#191;&#189;lffi) who has been reduced to his position as
  an 'imprisoned one' by the government and his sadness is offset
  by his playing his cello and studying his beloved astronomy.
  Nyitrai offers &#239;&#191;&#189;ron solace and introduces his
  'fellow traveler' to the glory of the stars, giving
  &#239;&#191;&#189;ron a map of the heavens that
  &#239;&#191;&#189;ron cherishes - his window to a world beyond
  the dark confines of his prison-like orphanage. He gradually wins
  over his fellow orphans and when Nyitrai, in the pit of
  depression for his life situation and the cruelty of the
  orphanage and the government, hangs himself. This horrid incident
  drives &#239;&#191;&#189;ron to organize an escape from the
  orphanage, an event that is ultimately fractured with a death for
  which &#239;&#191;&#189;ron feels responsible. And the end of the
  film fades into the many possibilities that event could trigger.
  The atmosphere created by the stunning cinematography by
  P&#239;&#191;&#189;ter Szatm&#239;&#191;&#189;ri defines the
  darkness that represents the orphanage well but also suggests the
  darkness in Hungary of that period. The musical score by
  P&#239;&#191;&#189;ter Fejcsik, Tam&#239;&#191;&#189;s
  G&#239;&#191;&#189;rg&#239;&#191;&#189;nyi, Ferenc Toma, and
  Bal&#239;&#191;&#189;zs Winkler is some of the most beautiful
  composed for the screen, making tremendously effective use of the
  cello and lower strings. In all, this is a brilliant piece of
  filmmaking, acted with depth in every role, and unveiling a
  portion of history and tragedy too often pushed to the background
  of our books. Highly Recommended. Grady Harp, March 06</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">Let's face it, Tinseltown has run out of
  original story lines. That's usually when they turn to remakes.
  I've seen several remakes over the years, both TV and movie, but
  this is one of the best remakes I've seen in quite some time. I
  really enjoyed how they expanded on the original story line. What
  a lot of people need to understand is that this movie had nothing
  to do with the TV show and pulled all of it's story from the
  comic book. If you were never into comics to begin with then you
  can't appreciate the story line. Another thing that I feel is
  under appreciated about this movie is the CGI. People have to
  understand that if they got some body builder and slapped green
  paint on him than the movie would have been a complete waste of
  time! The amount of man hours that went in to creating the CGI is
  something to be applauded and appreciated, not mocked and thrown
  out with the trash. You have to appreciate the movie for the
  story line and its artistic value. Most people were upset with
  this movie because they thought it was too slow and it should
  have been more fun and had a lot more action in it. The story of
  the Hulk is a sad, depressing, dramatic story! There isn't
  anything funny about being zapped with radiation and transforming
  into a mindless brute evertime you get ticked off about
  something. The Hulk wasn't meant to be campy, it was meant to be
  serious. My only gripe about this movie is that they could have
  picked a better actress to play Banner's love interest. The
  little amount of screen time she was given was completely
  wasted</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">P.D. James' mysteries rank as outstanding
  entertainment. This CD featuring Roy Marsden as Adam Dagliesch is
  excellent. It has well developed characters, a complex plot
  involving actions that took place years before, and scenes in
  both London and on England's coast. I highly recommend this
  product</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">Really worth seeing to learn about the life
  and talent of Budd Boetticher. The collectors edition allows you
  to watch for the elements of the film that make it special</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">I feel some of the other reviews here are
  unjust and over exagerated. There were two places in the film
  that in total lasted maybe about five minutes where the sound was
  distorted, but not badly since you could still understand the
  characters clearly (ex. one area had a warpy vhs noise and the
  second had a bit of low static). The costumes were well selected,
  but I felt a better job could have been done on the rats and the
  lizard (you can see a gap where the costume ends on his face).
  This version follows the book well, though it left out a favorite
  qoute about the taste of the liquid in the first scene that she
  drinks from the "drink me" bottle. I also felt that the British
  accents in the movie enhanced the film. I recomend this to fans
  and people who aren't overly critical of films</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">As both a big fan of this movie and a film
  student, I feel that critics have been quick to judge this film
  as bad trash. This film has a sexy edge to it, that many other
  films in the "teen film" genre dare to exhibit. New Best Friend
  fullfills a fantasy for those girls who secretly desire to live
  dangerously and party every night, without it actually becoming a
  reality. The house is every girl's dream, and these girls are
  alluring and suavely tempting. The acting is far from terrible,
  and it was great to see Meredith Monroe in a more sophisticated
  and darker role than her role as Andie in Dawson's Creek.
  Dominique Swain once again puts in an A+ effort for her role as
  the cheeky deviant Sydney. For anyone who loved films like Tart
  and Cruel intentions,this is the film for you.</Text>

  <Text category="dvd">A very well done and most interesting film
  on a very intelligent animal, the DOLPHIN. It is perfect. I'm
  buying copies to give to my friends</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">Tihs DVD truly has incredible camerawork,
  and fully illustrates the intelligence and beauty of dolphins,
  but some things people don't realize about dolphins kept in
  captivity need to be told. PLEASE take the time to read this.
  Many dolphins you see in aquariums and swim-with programs and
  circuses around the world often come from brutal drive hunts,
  during which dolphins are rounded up into very tight nets
  concealing them, and are dragged ashore making it easier to
  violently wrestle them into slings. These dolphins captured,
  while they may be smiling in appearance (which is the way their
  faces were genetically designed), are ripped away from their
  beloved podmates and torn from their environment. How would you
  like to be a dolphin who once lived in a vast sea of blue and
  then suddenly be taken into a shallow pool of water, forced to
  live with the loud sounds of people screaming, the filtration
  system running, and very little space to swim? In the process of
  capturing dolphins for human entertainment, many die in the
  process. Stress severely affects a dolphin's body, and many
  suffer irreperable damage to their hearts in the execution. On
  top of that, dependent calves (baby dolphins) who have spent the
  entirety of their lives with their mothers, often get torn from
  them, leaving them helpless, even if they are released. While you
  can clearly see in the film that many of the dolphins appear to
  be having fun, would it not be too much to consider the fact that
  they might miss their former companions? Are they really happier
  stuck in a cement tank forced to perform tricks in order to be
  fed? Keep this in mind the next time you visit an aquarium or
  swim-with program. For dolphins captured in Japan, the industry
  has been given permits to slaughter a number of them needlessly
  in the process by the government. I believe this film spends too
  little time in the beginning addressing the human threat to
  dolphins. Over 7,000,000 dolphins have died at the hands of
  humans since the late 1950s. I think a few minutes at the
  beginning of the film doesn't nearly suit the need to inform the
  audience of the issue. Tuna fisheries, whose products are falsely
  labeled as "dolphin-safe" (there are established 'KILL MINIMUMS'
  now for tuna companies) need to be exposed. Intentional killings
  in Japan (especially), South America, and all over the world need
  to be publicized. But I also understand that this is a family
  film, mainly, but I think it is also important to inform young
  viewers of the problems dolphins face with humans. They are the
  ones who will need to make the difference in the future. Please
  just remember this next time you watch this film. While dolphins
  are valued by many, they are targeted by many as well as a way of
  easy money-making. This film is more of a sugar-coated
  production, although it certainly is beautiful, as are the
  dolphins seen in the flim. I would recommend a film entitled
  "Dolphin Defender" for those who seek some informative footage
  behind the scenes to what really happens to dolphins in drive
  hunts.</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">I bought The Homecoming 3-4yrs ago, and I
  watch it every year at Christmas. I found it on the floor in my
  house after Hurricane Katrina, still in the package it came in. I
  brought the DVD to my new place of residence and popped it in the
  player and it has been playing since I found it. When ever I'm
  down it watch it, so I can relieve some of my own childhood
  memories of the season. It is a must see for the young and
  old</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">This movie is very simple, and unique. It's
  the kind of love story which you really believe in while you're
  watching because it doesn't feel phony. This can be credited to
  the acting, the situation, and the plot as well. This isn't about
  a man falling madly in love with a beautiful woman and then
  spending his life missing her. That's all been done, and that's
  what makes this film a breath of fresh air. River Phoenix shows
  why he is missed by so many, and really allows you to connect
  with his character. I recomend this to anyone who wants to see
  love put to true art, and be touched at the same time</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">Eddie and Rose are meant to be in Nicole
  Savoca's "Dogfight." This is a warm and wonderful movie; those of
  us who have seen it have an obligation to spread the word to as
  many others as we can. It's sad that so few people have heard of
  or seen Dogfight. How a film that was so universally well liked
  by viewers and critics managed to completely slip under the radar
  of popular attention is a mystery to me. Many others have
  synopsized the story, so I wont be repetitive. I will say that
  this movie's genius is in its acting. River Phoenix and Lili
  Taylor have the chemistry of childhood friends, and it shows in
  scene after scene. River gives the most endearing performance of
  his career in this film as the affectedly coarse, absurdly young
  "jarhead," Eddie, about to ship out to Vietnam. His coming of age
  is the narrative behind this movie, while Rose's idealism and
  grace throughout the humiliating ordeal of the "dogfight" make
  her character angelic. The poignancy of the closing scene, in
  which Eddie embraces Rose, in tears, after having lost his three
  best friends during the Vietnam war will stay with you for a long
  time. Dogfight is a unique and touching film. It harkens to a
  sensibility which is dissatisfied with much of the droll offered
  as "romantic" by Hollywood today.</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">I'm not sure why I never watched "Ghost"
  before until last night. For some reason, I didn't pay much heed
  to it when it was first released and never thought it was worth
  watching on TV. I'm glad I gave it a chance because this is a
  GOOD movie. What makes it good is its' skillful mixture of
  suspense, romance, comedy, and the supernatural. That would seem
  to be too much to tackle for one movie but we get it all in the
  right balance. I was drawn rather quickly into the movie and got
  to where I couldn't wait to see what was coming next. There were
  a few "convenient" capabilities that these ghosts had that were
  necessary for the story to work. I'm a rather pragmatic person
  but, by the time these things came up, I was so caught up in the
  story that I WANTED these things to be possible. Obviously, the
  writer and director deserve accolades for their work and the
  actors do as well. I wanted to make note of the quality of acting
  because it was probably the cast that left me uninterested in
  watching "Ghost". I was prepared to be unimpressed in particular
  with Whoopie Goldberg so I want to confess that I thought her
  Best Supporting Actress Oscar was well-deserved. I figure that I
  was one of the last persons in America to see "Ghost" but if
  there are others of you out there who still haven't seen it, give
  it a look; it's well worth it</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">OK, I rounded up to 4 stars. This really
  isn't bad, though. It's an idiom that most American viewers won't
  be familiar with. The major characters are Kuan Yin, Confucius,
  and a flock of other gods, godlings, immortals, buddhas, figures
  from myth, and other well-known figures and stereotypes from the
  Chinese pantheon. There are the flying heroes, improbable
  weapons, and acting at least on a par with the Dr. Who series. In
  other words, lots of viewers will see it as alien, disconnected,
  and amateurish, as well as being filled overly convenient
  miracles. But it's not in the Western idiom, so parts of it have
  to be taken in their own terms. And it has the look of a
  low-budget film, so you won't see effects on the Star Wars scale.
  And it is a bit cheesy and over-the-top, which is part of the
  appeal. The fights are bloodless, the romance is chaste, and all
  but the youngest kids will understand the characters. If you
  don't take it or yourself too seriously, there's a lot of fun in
  this one. //wiredweir</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">This movie is great! Very subtle humor but
  if you watch it you will be laughing out loud. Love it</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">If your a fan of progressive rock, you
  probably already know how good this CD is. In my mind it is the
  single greatest CD of all time (followed closely by Operation
  Mindcrime, any of the great Pink Floyd and Rush records) My only
  complaint on this DVD, is the sound. I was at this show and the
  sound at the theater was great. Somewhere, it didn't transfer to
  the recording. It is not the worst thing I have ever heard, but
  it doesn't show the bands power live. Every other aspect of this
  DVD is well worth the price. I would not want to be with out
  it.</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">This movie has the best opening scene ever!
  It's amazing how great they made this movie considering the first

  <Text category="dvd">I loved this film. The writting, story,
  special effects, acting, and directing exceed the original. I
  recomend this film to any fan of the genre</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">it gets laughs in its comicness in certain
  scenes it gets shocks like the beginning war scenes and the fight
  scenes it gets more interesting as the plot unravels great actors
  picked for such roles the perfect killing machines one insane in
  the brain and one out to save lives that shouldn't be lost in the
  first place the diner scene where the soldier orders alot of food
  and keeps eating and the guy says how you gonna pay for this and
  the soldier says "I just want to eat, I don't wanna hurt you,
  then he kicks ass while still enjoying his meal. and his reporter
  female friend comes in and says "good meal" as a question that
  is. and he says without words "makes a happy sigh" that's
  hilarious. and how she looks around and see everyone who got
  their ass kicked from keeping him from eating his food priceless
  movie worth the watch again and again I'm glad I saw this on tv
  when I was younger and I'm glad I got this on dv</Text>

  <Text category="dvd">Robert Ryan made a number of Westerns during
  the 1950s and '60s, but always he seemed to be overshadowed by
  other actors in the genre. Nevertheless, who can forget THE WILD
  BUNCH or his magnificent portrayal of "old man Clanton" in the
  seriously underrated HOUR OF THE GUN (with James Garner). And his
  self-effacing determination is equally unforgettable in THE DAY
  OF THE OUTLAW. Now one of his best roles, as the straight-arrow
  sheriff in THE PROUD ONES is on DVD and available at a very
  reasonable price. Finally. THE PROUD ONES is perhaps director
  Robert Webb's finest picture, combining great action scenes and
  plot twists, taught dialogue, and a superior cast that includes
  not only Ryan, but Jeffrey Hunter, Walter Brennan, Virginia Mayo,
  and Robert Middleton. Minor roles are given attention as well,
  especially Arthur O'Connell (as Ryan's deputy) and, important
  thematically, the wonderful Paul Burns, who plays the town drunk
  and panhandler....Hunter, when he finally assumes the mantle of
  sheriff, will give alms to Burns at the finish of the movie, just
  as Ryan did at the beginning, when he was sheriff. This touch
  dramatically completes the movie and has much to say about
  Hunter's increased maturity. THE PROUD ONES is a superb movie,
  with a great story...it will repay re-viewing. Unlike some
  Westerns, I don't tire of watching it periodically. It is that
  good...</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">Ray Sawyer (Rick Cramer), Agnes Bruckner
  (Eden), Laura Ramsey (Rachel), Jonathan Jackson (Eric), and D.J.
  Cotrana (Sean) star in this scary and bloody slasher movie. Eric
  and Eden are going through any typical teen romance; going steady
  one minute, broken up the next. Eden works at a local truck stop
  as a waitress. One evening, Ray pulls into the truck stop to get
  some food. Known as the local nut case, Ray has few friends and
  owns a filling station on the edge of town. Later that same
  evening, Ray comes upon Eric and Eden on a lonely bridge.
  Swerving to miss Eric's jeep, Ray instead crashes into an
  on-coming car. The impact of the crash sends the car slamming
  through the guardrail of the bridge. The car is now teetering
  precariously on the side of the bridge. Ray jumps from his truck
  and goes to the aid of the woman inside the car. After pulling
  her to safety, Ray goes back inside to retrieve a suitcase that
  the woman told him about. However, both Ray and the car tumble
  over the side of the bridge and into the water below. To make
  matters worse, the suitcase is full of poisonous snakes, who
  immediately begin striking at Ray. All that can be heard are
  Ray's screams as the car sinks. Ray's body is pulled from the
  water and taken to the local morgue. But it doesn't remain there
  for long. It seems that the woman in the car was a Voodoo
  priestess, and the snakes were used to "cleanse" people by
  drawing the evil out of them. Now, the evil venom is flowing
  through Ray. Now begins a bloodbath of carnage as Ray, possessed
  by the power of the evil venom flowing through him, begins to
  stalk unsuspecting victims. One by one, he exacts his revenge on
  Eden's friends until only Eden remains. Who will win this final
  showdown; Ray or Eden? I've always been a big fan of slasher-type
  films, and characters like Freddy from the "Nightmare on Elm
  Street" series, as well as Jason from "Friday the 13th". Ray
  Sawyer fits the mold of the typical slasher perfectly. The
  motives are the same; kill as many teenagers as possible, and Ray
  succeeds in this very well. I thought the story involving voodoo
  was well-conceived. The special effects were good, too. I
  recommend this movie to horror and slasher fans. Although the
  movie is short (only about 80 minutes), there's lots of slashing
  in a short amount of time. If you enjoy a good slasher flick,
  then don't miss "Venom".</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">"Venom " is one of those movies I thought I
  would hate because I heard so much negativity about it but I
  really enjoyed it ,being a fan of the 70's and 80's slashers I
  crave newer versions because I have seen all the other ones over
  and over again. Venom did NOT disappoint me. It starts off with
  action and never lets up.I found it to be one of my favorite new
  horror/slasher flicks,The voodoo angle was good but not
  overplayed ,I'm simple in that I want to see a killer with an axe
  , machete butcher knife etc not a bunch of supernatural mumbo
  jumbo..I don't want to have to wonder" was that a dream or was it
  real~!!" As so many movies these days play off of. Give me an old
  fashioned slice and dice and I'm in heaven.and Venom gave me that
  , So I hope to see Venom 2 ,if so ,I'm there (For the record, Mr
  Jangles used the hook &amp;amp; Chain before Kane in see No
  Evil...) ..</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">This DVD version of the movie looks great
  and is very enjoyable. Hayley Mills is her usual irrepressible
  self, and the supporting cast is top notch. The feline actor in
  particular! ;) I don't quite understand the anger from some other
  reviewers about the fullscreen format. It didn't bother me at
  all. Disappointment I could understand, but this kind of vitriol?
  It's still a very watchable and enjoyable film for all ages, and
  I found it a refreshing change from the dumbed-down "kid's"
  movies they tend to make these days. Adults will enjoy the
  suspenseful story, retro style, and feline antics just as much as
  kids will. I'd skip the remake and get the original</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">War exposed some violence simmering within
  one Gulf War veteran. Christian Bale is electrifying as Jim, a
  tough-minded ex-Ranger whose brutal nature didn't subside after
  his return home to LA. They say war changes a man. This might be
  evident here, but it feels more like the fighting only unleashed
  the demons inside of Jim. Along with his buddy Mike(Freddy
  Rodriguez), the two tear through the town, bingeing on drugs and
  alcohol. Their is no deep plot here, just a couple of ruffians
  going around town looking for jobs. But it is a great character
  study, watching Jim self-destruct. Bale is great in this type of
  role, like he was in American Psycho or The Machinist. I liked
  this movie much more than Training Day, which this director
  previously wrote the screenplay for</Text>

  <Text category="dvd">When Paul McCartney goes on tour to connect
  with his beloved audience, it usually for more than just the
  average "Oh, I have an album to promote, let me go on tour". His
  1989 tour was Paul's first time onstage in many years, and he
  used it to show he not only still had the energy and vigor he
  posssessed during his Beatles &amp;amp; Wings years, but he also
  still was able to create a deep, personal bond with his audience
  like few if any other artists can. This spawned the excellent
  double live album "Tripping The Live Fantastic" as well as the
  exciting concert movie "Get Back". His 2002 American tour was a
  chance for Paul to use the healing power of music to ease the
  seething sadness caused by the horrific attacks on September
  11th. The cd and dvd "Back In The U.S." were released to
  commemorate this wonderful act of musical philanthropy. In 2005,
  Paul did something that had long been awaited since The Beatles
  first hit. Ever since The Cold War, The Beatles were a huge
  phenemenon in Russia. However, there Communist government
  considered their music alien propoganda, and their music was
  outlawed. Still, the Russian citizens got their hands on The
  Beatles' recordings any way they could, and they felt a great
  deal of inspiration from them, making them belive there was a
  free world beyond the Iron Curtain. Over 40 years later, Paul
  ventured to Moscow to perform a historic concert in Red Square to
  hundreds of thousands of devoted fans who had been waiting all
  their lives for this moment. The concert was filmed and was aired
  on A &amp;amp; E as "Paul McCartney - Live In Red Square". This
  is quite simply an excellent concert movie. Paul and his band are
  in top form. Paul clearly wanted to give the Russian fans a night
  they'd never forget, pouring his heart and soul as well as his
  boundless energy into old warhorses such as "Band On The Run",
  "Live And Let Die", "Back In The U.S.S.R.", "Hey Jude" and "Let
  It Be", as well as performing rarely heard numbers such as "Two
  Of Us", "I've Just Seen A Face" and "Let 'Em In". Mixed in with
  the live performances are commentaries by scholars and fans on
  how The Beatles' music had such a connection with the Russians
  during the Cold War, and why they still remained so popular.
  These interviews manage to come off as insightful and
  entertaining rather than annoying and unneccessary, even when
  they occasionally cut off certain numbers. As an added bonus, we
  get another concert of Paul in St. Petersburg. This is once again
  an excellent, energetic and fun show that shows why Paul to this
  day remains quite possibly the most beloved man in the music
  world. The sound and picture quality are excellent, and the
  special features are a nice treat. "Live In Red Square" is an
  excellent dvd that belongs in everyone's collection</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">There are two story lines here, one an
  unqualified celebration of the state of girls' prep sports after
  a generation of Title IX's beneficial impact, and another the
  very qualified consideration of the state of some individual

  beneficial side-effects. Heartbreak, fury, exultation are the
  viewer's rewards. Only quibble is that the climactic game was
  documented in too abbreviated a manner</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">A DVD with a message that pulls at the
  heart, and presents sadness and then joy to the viewer. Strong
  singing cast with excellent voices. A must see</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">This is a film like none other you have ever
  seen, and as such you'll either love it, or hate it. From the
  "reviews" posted on Amazon, I've come to the conclusion that the
  people who hate it are simply people who don't have the
  intelligence to have understood a word of it. This film is not
  literal. Learn to *think* about what you are watching. To
  interpret archetypes, symbolism and metaphor. A clue: the Lady
  character is named STORY. Now why might that be? And why would
  she require a VESSEL before taking flight into the world? And
  what precisely does the wolf-like Scrunt represent? And why are
  there THREE of those monkeys? This film is a love letter from one
  creative person to all other creatives in the world. If you
  aren't an artist, you probably won't get it at all, and might
  even post a scathing review of it on sites such as this. But that
  achieves nothing but illustrate how stupid you truly are to the
  artistic souls that will understand everything this film says,
  and love every beautiful, unique and visionary second of it.

  <Text category="dvd">Like her legendary mother, nobody around

  <Text category="dvd">It's just like the Hit TV Show! In fact they

  <Text category="dvd">Less technicolor and more monochromatic than
  its predecessor, "In Like Flint" still uses broad strokes to
  great advantage in poking fun at the Bond films. The indomitable
  Derek Flint returns to save the world, this time from a bevy of
  beauties who simultaneously raise the ire of the world's women
  while replacing powerful males with surgically-altered
  substitutes (leading to, perhaps, the most prescient line of
  dialogue in any 1960s film--upon discovering that the man in the
  White House is not who he seems to be, a disbelieving Flint says,
  "An actor as president?"). That is, until a renegade ZOWIE
  general (Steve Inhat) decides it's his turn to take the reins of
  power. The delightful Lee J. Cobb is back as Flint's curmudgeonly
  boss, Cramden, as are the secret agent's posse of female
  admirers, and TV's Batgirl, Yvonne Craig, even shows up as a
  Russian ballerina. "In Like Flint" feels more grown up than the
  previous film, partly because the lighting and cinematography are
  more stark and partly because the humor is sometimes more rooted
  in satire than parody. Notions like the Red Scare being a feint
  to the very real dangers of corruption from within and the beauty
  industry actually having our worst interests in mind--and
  charging a premium for them--are slipped in with more obvious
  gags involving oversized eyebrows, cross-dressing, and the
  bouncing sing-a-long ball. Only the crankiest among us are likely
  to find the juvenile sexism of either Flint film worth comment,
  as it's a staple of the genre, meaning that the biggest weakness
  here is the same as the earlier effort: a no-frills DVD.</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">It's a funny concept to begin with, and
  Stiller is hilarious. Then you throw in Rip Torn (probably the
  best film Judas, among his many credits over the years), and
  these cameos that are out of control (Shatner, Armstrong, Norris)
  and you've got a comic classic.</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">A wonderful movie which deserved all the
  awards which were bestowed upon it. It is refreshing to view
  great movies with wonderful stories minus bad language and
  nudity. As a big fan of Greer Garson, I must comment on Jane
  Bedinger's review in which she claimed that Ms. Garson was having
  an "affair" with the actor who played her son. Ms. Garson fell in
  love with and married Richard Ney about a year after the movie
  was made. I don't see how Ms. Bedinger could consider this an
  "affair".</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">Well, almost. The seats were good and I
  drank straight out of the bottle. The DVD wasn't what I thought I
  had purchased but I'm not at all unhappy about getting it. Very,
  very, very good quality audio/video and I don't mind watching it
  often</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">Is there anything more American then apple
  pie, baseball or a good Rock Hudson/Doris Day Film? It's always
  been such a treat to curl up with them and the third essential
  player, Tony Randall. Rock is always doing something to infuriate
  Doris. He's her worst nightmare. And what's more, he pretends to
  be someone else that Doris falls for head over heals until the
  gig is up. Then she's out for revenge, but love always wins out.
  Ahhhh such feel good, laugh out loud stuff. So in this one from
  1961 "Lover Come Back", Madison Ave is the setting. Advertising
  is the game of Carol Templeton and rival Jerry Webster. But Jerry
  is such a cad and a playboy. He steals big clients right from
  under her by wining and dining them, throwing raucous parties and
  getting the girl for them. Carol on the other hand, does things a
  little different. She's virtuous and business like. When he
  trumps her cards once too often, she plans to get a little
  underhanded herself. Trying to win over the scientist that is
  going to invent a new product for our guy Rock, Doris, who has
  never met Webster(as is always the case), mistakes him for...you
  guessed it..the shy, retiring, needy nerdy scientist. Jerry, in
  true form goes along with it, and tries to woo Carol into his
  bed. And the fun continues... Doris is marvelous. Watch her face.
  So many different emotions she goes through. From being
  Exasperated, to being in love, she does it all. She's simply a
  joy. Rock matches her perfectly with his pretenses, and has a way
  with the dialogue that just says Rock! As mentioned Tony Randall
  is always the third part to the equation that makes these films
  such classic fun. Here he is the President of the ad firm and
  Jerry's boss, but hasn't a clue as to what's going on. He does
  this quite well.Meanwhile, the fun doesn't end with Doris and
  Rock. The race to make a new product, VIP! is causing quite a few
  explosions and when the product is finally ready for
  testing...well you just have to see for yourself! The rest of the
  cast is quite a roll call. Ann B Davis, Delbert Mann, Donna
  Douglas(the beautiful Ellie Mae Clampett), Edie Adams, Jack
  Albertson, Jack Oakie, Joe Flynn, Richard Deacon,wow... the list
  goes on. The transfer to DVD looks great. Picture clear, colors
  good.The film is presented in Anamorphic widescreen 1.85:1 The
  sound is in Dol Dig 2.0(MONO), but this isn't an action flick, so
  it's fine.There are caption in English(a nod to Universal there),
  subtitles in Spanish and French. There are no features of any
  kind other than scene selections. This film is a treasure from
  the 60's vault. Doris' outfits alone are smashing, and NYC in the
  60's too. This film has no rating on the case, but I would say
  PG. There are some adult situations, but all done in tasteful
  fun(can you imagine Doris Day, doing anything else, even if she
  tried?).The other two films that this trio delight us with is
  "Pillow Talk" and "Send Me No Flowers" Well, I'm off to watch
  another Day/Hudson/Randall film. I've got my bowl of VIP and
  ready for a fun evening.....Lauri</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">After starting my 9/11 odyssey from
  ignorance to full blown "WHAT!" after "Loose Change - 2nd Ed"
  last year, I've watched and or read just about them all. 9/11:
  Press for Truth comes out on top, in my humble opinion, as the
  best 9/11 timeline presentation out there. Nothing included that
  isn't in the mainstream press - just on the back page, and spread
  out over five years. The film makes few of the outright
  accusations that "Loose Change 2nd - Ed" does towards any of the
  events or people involved in 9/11, but delivers more of damning
  argument that we've been lied to - there weren't just mistakes
  made, but distortions and deceit at the highest levels of our
  government. I hope that we, the people, finally demand a real
  investigation and the truth comes out. And the bad guys pay. Good

  <Text category="dvd">Wonderful. I forgot how many great songs

  <Text category="dvd">Four stars seem a little generous. The film
  is certainly memorable, and certainly different. There are a lot
  of odd things going on here. The oddest is why the central
  character, Mark Lewis, is so obviously a blond, blue-eyed German.
  Very strange, this. Is there some weird subterranean comment
  about the sickness of Hitler's Germany, and how we ought to feel
  sorry for the perpetrators of his crimes, because of their
  blighted childhoods? Much of the rest of the symbolism is very
  heavy-handed, however, as other reviewers have pointed out. It is
  consistently perverse. The director of the film within the film:
  "The Walls are Closing In", is played by an actor who was in
  point of fact virtually blind. He had a bit part in several James
  Bond films. Is there some message here? Peeping Tom's father, the
  heartless psychologist, was played by Powell himself. What is
  this telling us? Is part of the message meant to be that the
  camera kills? It doesn't hang together somehow. What's the
  meaning of the model with half a hideous face? Why is the
  would-be girl-friend's alcoholic mother blind? Why is the only
  presence with real star quality, Moira Shearer, playing a
  stand-in? Much of the premise of the film seems promising, but it
  is clumsily written, and directed with a leaden hand. In fact,
  what many of the Powell-Pressburger films seem to lack is any
  real sense of pace or excitement. It's all a bit tired, and slow.
  There is nausea, but no shock or thrill. Loco, perhaps, but
  Psycho, it isn't.</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">Edmund O'Brien is a CPA who decides to get
  away to San Francisco for a weekend to sow some wild oats (and
  also to get away from his secretary who's nagging him to marry
  her). There he's poisoned and told he has only a few days to
  live; he tries to find out who poisoned him and why. The trail
  takes him into a world of corruption and double dealing.
  Following this trail is a bit confusing for O'Brien and the
  audience. But the picture is tightly directed and well acted. A
  highly regarded film-noir entry, and rightly so. Worth a
  watch</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">This DVD of the Wiggles is my 21/2 year old
  grandsons favorite. He watches it every day and never tires of
  it. I enjoy watching it with him. The Wiggles are great
  entertainment for people of all ages. I don't think you can go
  wrong with The Wiggles</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">The Dead Zone is still one of the best shows
  on tv, and while I agree with some of the other posts, the
  Stillson story arc was handled, well, strangely. As for the DVD's
  the box reads "Closed Captioned" as a feature. Sadly they are
  not. Hopefully USA knows about this, and will remedy the
  situation</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">This movie was probably the best one next to
  Lucario and the Mystery of Mew and Jirachi Wish Maker. Pokemon
  Ranger centers around the legendary Pokemon Manaphy and of course
  Ash and his friends. Some new and amazing characters include
  Buizel, Jackie the Ranger, Mantyke, and Chatot the annoying but
  funny Pokemon. The villian is great, the ending is amazing, and
  the effects were the best yet</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">Whenever I think of the Second World War,
  the two places I usually think about in terms of carnage is the
  Eastern Front; and the war between Nazi Germany and Soviet
  Russia. The other is the Pacific Campaign between the USA and
  Japan. One of the reviewers wrote, "I'm glad the Russian Won." So
  am I. And what a bloody war it was. The number of casualties and
  amount of destruction make what occurred in the others parts of
  the globe [except Asia] seem pale in comparison. The Russians
  suffered greatly at the hands of the Germans, and the German army
  paid one hell of a steep price. Also, it was in the east where
  the Germans committed some of the most horrendous atrocities
  known to mankind. It was in the east where extermination camps
  were set up to murder millions of Jews: The German program of the
  'Final Solution.' Everything I have ever read about the Second
  World War concerning the eastern front is one of brutality on a
  scope that is horrifically mind-boggling. It's as if life were
  cheap and each day may have been the last. This documentary does
  a very decent job in attempting to address the fighting between
  these two armies. From Barbarossa to Berlin, it is one of the
  best documenatries out there. At least for the 200 minutes that
  the film devotes to the eastern front. I don't believe this is
  the definitive documentary, as more and more information is being
  released now that the Soviet Union is no more. But for now, I
  highly recommend this film. [Stars: 4.5]</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">This video is great for the beginners and
  the advanced beginners. I started taking a Vinyasa class and was
  unable to coordinate my schedule with class times so I looked for
  a video to supplement my practice at home. What a great choice.
  Baron Baptiste takes his time to explain the poses and provides
  the mood that is needed to practice yoga at home. I highly
  recommend this DVD</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">OK, this definately looks very promising. I
  saw a version of this on the Flix channel about three nights ago.
  It was good. If that is any indication on how good the show is
  then this Collector's Edition Box Set of the older series should
  be better. I am going to purchase this soon. Once I purchase it,
  I will let you know how good it really is. I'll give another
  review once I purchase this boxed set and have an opportunity to
  view the episodes . A month ago is when I really learned of this
  series so I am truly looking forward to watching this series.

  <Text category="dvd">This is a great DVD. I bought it for my son,
  who has Special Needs. He attends a lot of dances and is always
  on the dance floor, but has never been able to figure out how to
  do the Electric Slide or Macarena. Neither my husband nor I knew
  how to do these dances either. I played the "Party Line Dances"
  DVD, and asked my son to follow Shawn's instructions. Pretty soon
  he was moving along with Shawn, and doing very well. And by
  joining a few of our son's practices, my husband and I quickly
  picked up the dance moves too. My son now participates fully, and
  we look forward to line dancing at our own occasions</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">Hey...this is a great DVD with great
  packaging--definitely one of the best that I've seen, and there
  is a lot of extras. Definitely a must-have for He-Man and She-Ra
  fans! I just got an e-mail stating that the distributor of He-Man
  will be releasing She-Ra on DVD, starting July 11. That release
  will be "The Secret of the Sword" and five other episodes deemed
  most popular by fans. After that, in the fall they will release
  the complete 93 episodes in three separate volumes within the
  next 12 months. For anyone who wants to see for themselves, go to
  tvshowsondvd.com and look at the news for She-Ra. I hope you are
  as excited as I am</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">Don't listen to anyone when they say this
  movie is bad, it's good. Elektra is filled with aciton, and FX
  and supervillians! Elektra is one of the best Marvel Movies! Go
  see it now</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">I found this movie delightful--from the
  storyline, directing and photography to the actors! I especially
  loved the performances of Timothy Bottoms and Chloris Leachman!
  It's an enlightening movie that makes an important point:
  sometimes what we think we want is not really what we want at
  all</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">Season four is excellent, can't wait for the
  release of season five</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">I rented this (sigh) several years ago,
  liked it or Julia Roberts enough to buy it but didn't open the
  new copy until the other day and watched it today. I regretted
  buying a new copy after all, remembering it only as a few
  heartwarming (I didn't want my heart warmed) months in the lives
  of just plain folks in CT. (Incidentally, the 3 girls are not
  sisters, just 2 of them.) I made fun of it, my friend made fun of
  it, I watched a few minutes then turned it off, then watched some
  more, finally got up to about 40 minutes and decided to finish
  it. It has charm. It IS a soap opera, but I thought it was well
  acted and well done. It had humor, happiness, sadness,
  embarrassment (like the barrels of fish in the rich kid's car),
  love. It had so much plot that it practically had none at all.
  And I liked it. But now, 15 minutes later, I'm beginning all over
  again to wonder why I bought it. I could have done without
  hearing sinatra singing in the background toward the end of the
  flick. That man was a nauseous menace and could barely sing at
  all, no range, no depth, somehow he could carry a tune, but
  that's about the size of it, speaking of size, the size of his
  ego (which I assume is why he didn't deign to sing the tunes the
  way the songwriters wrote them or the lyrics) would have made a
  mushroom cloud! I recommend this movie if you like this kind of
  thing. For it's kind, I thought it was perfectly done. I just
  like them a smidge more sophisticated. The vulgarity and
  blasphemies were delicious.</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">If you liked Yul Brynner in
  &amp;amp;quot;The Magnificent Seven&amp;amp;quot; you will love
  him in this movie. Brynner is cool as they come. This is a great
  western and should be on DVD</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">I previously wrote a review for this and
  only gave it 3 stars. But after watching it again, I realized I
  liked it better (I do agree with the reviewer below me in that it
  does grow on you). I do not consider all of the performances
  goth. Martiya Possesion are more tribal than anything(at least on
  this video) and I really dislike the expression, or lack thereof,
  on their faces while they are dancing. They either look
  completely bored, pissed off, or smug. I skip right over it. I
  also did not care for Asharah's dance to the drum solo by Solace
  ("Opaque"). The dance mood does not match the mood of the music
  at all. The music is saying "fast, big, upbeat" and she's
  standing there doing taxim moves and small quick moves. And of
  course, we all love the S&amp;amp;M piece...excuse me,
  S&amp;amp;M is NOT part of the Goth subculture, and has no place
  on a bellydance video. Jehan may be a great and accomplished
  dancer, but she didn't dance much on this and I didn't want to
  see what WAS on her part. Another thing I would have liked to see
  is more GOTH music. I like Solace and all, but there were a lot
  of songs by them on this video and it would have been nice to see
  some more pieces done to music from the Goth genre. There were a
  few, but not enough for my liking. My favorites on this video
  were Tempest, Ariellah, Jeniviva and Ayshe (for wierdness
  factor). For all of its faults, this is a good video to be
  inspired by and I will use it for that purpose</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">This movie is perfect for people in their
  40ies and/or 50ies. It just hits the bullseye. Lean back and
  enjoy the ride</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">beware! this is not the tv series as
  described by the first reviewer (not the reviewer's fault). this
  is instead, the movie version of "return to treasure Island", and

  <Text category="dvd">Great movie and musical numbers courtesy of
  Quincy Jones and the wonderful cast.</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">They do't make musicals like this anymore.
  Well,they don't really make musicals anymore, do they? They used
  to make them, made them well and they came out like "Down
  Argentine Way." The plot is just enough to keep your interest but
  the music is bright,costumes lavish and not a few laughts. The
  major players- Betty Grable and Don Ameche- are as engaging as
  usual.Carmen Miranda makes her US film debut and sings, dances
  and mispronounces her way to stardom. The 20th Century Fox role
  players appear (Charlotte Greenwood, J. Carrol Naish, Henry
  Stephenson)and add to the fun.</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">This is a great DVD collection of a great
  show. I hope that they follow up this set and the Christmas set
  with another 3 disc set of shows. As great as this set is, it
  just left me wanting more. I hope they deliver. There are still
  many, many classic episodes left to be seen. It was worth every
  penny.</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">Joan Crawford had it. Star quality. When I
  first saw her in 'Grand Hotel' I was surprised how much I was
  watching her character instead of the equally riveting character
  played by the great Greta Garbo. Both were STARS. But Crawford
  was able to project a different kind of sensuality than Garbo - a
  vulnerability, a plucky girl-next-door quality. In Humoresque, an
  older Crawford was still able to achieve this level of
  performance paired off with the younger male star. Let's face it
  - women have a great advantage acting (perhaps women are always
  acting) - besides being better looking than men, they can emote
  more without going out of gender role. A distinct advantage
  vis-a-vis men who must restrict their emotional range or be
  accused of over acting. It's a horrible thing to fall in love.
  And that is just what Crawford's character does. Falls in love
  with the worst of all possible choices: a musician. Musicians
  only love music. The music in the film is worth the price of
  admission alone. Who amongst you would throw the first stone at a
  fine violinist playing 'Zigeunerwisser' or any of the other fine
  war horses of the classical violin repertoire? She falls in love
  with the young 'artist of the month' whom she offers to help
  jumpstart his career, renting a concert hall for his first
  recital. She is married to a wealthy but understanding man who
  loves her but lets her do what she wants - drinking, philandering
  ... Most men do what she wants and accept her ridicule. The
  character of the musician does not; he's a tough New Yorker who
  gives her as good as he gets - and she finds herself loving him
  despite herself. Love is madness, and when he starts being
  successful with his concert tours but neglects to phone her for
  weeks, she falls apart emotionally. It is profoundly humiliating
  to realize someone else can hurt you badly simply by declining to
  keep in touch. Silence is the perfect expression of contempt,
  isn't it? She drinks, she mopes about her 'cottage' in the
  Hamptons, she is crazy in love with a man who doesn't seem to
  reciprocate her feelings. In our time, she might see her doc and
  get a prescription for Zoloft to be rid of the lovesick blues and
  of obsessive thoughts of him. But this is before Thorazine, even,
  and she's just out of luck there. So she drinks. Drinking was the
  preferred way to deaden the unbearable pain of rejection in love
  in the days before designer drugs were available from your
  neighborhood spice man. To complicate things, her musician had an
  old girlfriend from the conservatory where he studied music as a
  young man. Additionally, there was the dreaded 'american mom' in
  full armor. She just had to tell this grown son of hers,
  repeatedly, that the woman he finally fell in love with was no
  good. She even slaps him upside the head as he shows her around
  his ritzy new apartment with a view; it seems he has too many
  portraits of Crawford's character in view. That's the way, Mom.
  Make your boy marry a good girl, like you, maybe. Meanwhile, and
  I just love a line the character played by Oscar Levant comes up
  with at her cottage in the Hamptons, "You're not the kind of
  woman who lets her husband get in the way of her marriage." A lot
  funnier said than written. Levant did a lot of great piano
  playing in the film, dropping dozens of one liners like that. He
  almost stole several acts. This is a very forties film. In black
  and white. Whatever happened to the colorization process? Oh,
  well. Finally, Mom tells the rich girl to keep her hands off her
  son. And dutifully, Crawford's character retreats to her cottage
  in the Hamptons, gets drunk one last time, wades into the surf in
  a stunning, shimmering black cocktail dress and is never seen
  again. I told you love was dangerous! Her lover, after cancelling
  one measly concert out of despair at her death, decides not to
  ruin a promising career and returns to the concert stage. Men!
  Emotional IQs of 30, at most. Well, that's all folks. If your
  eyes were still dry at the end of this film, you're safe - you'll
  never fall in love</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">"American Gigolo" stars Richard Gere of a
  high priced male prostitute. He is coasting along with his rich
  southern Cailifonia clients until one of them is murdered. When
  he is considered the main suspect, he goes on the run, with his
  only friend being the wife of a politician. At the begining he
  tells people that he is a moral man, for example, he dosn't
  service gays, more on that in a moment. It is interseting to note
  that Gere also played in a movie about hookers a decade later in
  "Pretty Woman" and it made a star out of Julia Roberts. But that
  is where the similarities end. This is a much darker story about
  hypocracy. When he falls under suspicion all his clients that
  liked him before all distance themselves from him. In the end, he
  finds himself a hypocrit, because in order to get an aliby he is
  willing to do anything job; gays, S and M, anything to avoid
  jail. The only love story here is about him and the politician's
  wife (Lauren Hutten). It is complicated by the fact that he will
  not let anyone in close to him, even for his own protection. For
  all it's darkness there is one funny scene. Richard Gere is
  called in for a line up at the police department. He tells the
  other men in the line up that he got paid, and the others get
  angry and cause a scene, averting the attention off of Gere. This
  is a really good movie as an examination of society's attitude
  toward sex. This film was written and directed by Paul Schrader,
  if that is why it seems like a less brutal companion to "Taxi
  Driver". Richard Gere is wooden, but his character is cold and
  icy, so that approach is right. Lauren Hutten is alright as the
  bored housewife of a powerful man; she seems sincere in wanting
  to help Gere. But I thought the standout performance was Bill
  Duke as the slezzy street pimp who is quiet but menacing (as
  oppose to Gere's 'Madam'), but also provides the warning to Gere
  at the beginning that his 15 minutes of fame are running out. And
  another future "Pretty Woman" player is present; Hector Elanzo.
  He plays the detective on Gere's trail; but he is slimy and
  rather unlikable here. Well worth your time, but for adults
  only</Text>

  <Text category="dvd">This film harks back to a time when
  africentricity was woven into the psyche of the younger
  generation. Blackness informed all of their life decisions and
  defined their aesthetic. This is definitely true of the younger
  generation in this film. Another dynamic at play in this film is
  a sort of intergenerational upheaval. Some members of the older
  generation were reconsidering their long held beleifs on what it
  meant to be Black in America while the rest of the older
  generation stood firm staunchly defending their fossilized
  ideals. So if you're in the mood to see a comedic family film
  with a post sixties revolutionary air view "Five On the Black
  Hand Side" and breathe in the culture</Text>

  <Text category="dvd">The ultimate edition of this movie, lots of
  extras and the image and sound are great</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">DMX stars as the drug dealer King David, who
  pops up in the streets again after a long absence. Rolling into
  the frame in a player's classic - a late 70's Stutz Blackhawk -
  King David shrugs his way back into the hard-knock life. He
  quickly reaps what he sows and, mortally wounded, passes all his
  worldly goods to Paul (David Arquette), a scrambling white
  would-be writer. King David's estate includes an audio journal of
  his life, which provides flashbacks and a
  narrative-within-a-narrative that answers the shaken Paul's
  curiosity. It's the highlights of King David's high life that
  propel "Alone." Like all of Goines's heroes, King David is a
  scourge on the periphery, and the movie dramatizes his corrosive
  effect on the margins with savvy muscularity. Every life he
  touches he leaves in ruins - a need to deface beauty as a result
  of self-loathing is implicit, and DMX signals that motivation
  with sly hostility. To say that King David is the best part he's
  ever had is an understatement; he has never felt the need to
  inhabit a movie in this way before. I would recomed this to
  anyone who likes the hip hop lifestyle or music and for anyone
  who like films with a twist</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">Grew up watching Have Gun Will Travel. Very
  pleased to have it out on a DVD format. Watched the first season
  and am very pleased. bought season 2 and season 3 also. Anxiously
  awaiting 4, 5, and 6</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">The best edition so far,however... The color
  is smeared and skewed just enough to bother me. But what do you
  want for 10 bucks? I saw Gorgo a bunch of times in first run, and
  I remember seeing the actual Gorgo creature on it's trailer being
  driven up Woodward ave in Detroit on it's way to the Fox theater.
  A great promo. The eyes are the thing I remember most as Gorgo
  rises from the sea, those red glowing eyes were just beautiful
  and so expressive. The color smearing just manages to obscure
  those eyes. But still this print is the best I've seen. If I live
  long enough, I hope they issue a perfect HD version of this
  movie. I would pay 3 times the price of this edition to get my
  clutches on that. But this is worth the cost. A must for any
  serious collector</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">I just watched "Mommie Dearest" for the
  first time tonight. As most critics and fans of "Mommie Dearest"
  acknowledge, the film portrays such a pitiful story of abuse,
  with such an over-dramatic (but entirely true-to-life)
  performance by Faye Dunaway, it was both hilarious and
  depressing. I'm 30 and didn't know much about Joan Crawford
  outside of the endless chatter about the film being "classic
  camp." Seems to me Crawford was probably bi-polar or had some
  other unexplained mental disorder. I think she was quite aware
  that some of the insanity she lived with was caused by movie
  industry she was dedicated to. She knew the industry poisoned any
  good thing she endeavored to do, whether it was having a
  successful marriage, a happy family, or even giving to charity.
  Her life was a running commercial directed by Hollywood, not
  unlike the tabloid-driven, image-obsessed Hollywood we have
  today. Despite the often-times hilarious image of her and her
  sibling's victimization on film, Christina's abuse and
  disappointment with her mother was real and painful at some point
  in her life. Christina Crawford was completely justified turning
  her mother's image on its head with her book and movie. Yes, the
  movie is outrageous but it is also empowering. After all, what
  can the powerless do about their pitiful past except laugh.
  Mocking the unexplained, unjustified pain you experienced in the
  past, renders it powerless to harm your future. This is the
  legacy of "Mommie Dearest" whatever Joan Crawford really
  was</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">I don't own a copy of the original cut, and
  it's been a while since I've seen the original cut. A short
  review of THIS version is as follows. The film print is FLAWLESS
  in the sense it looks like it was shot in the 70's or 80's on
  purpose. The blue filter is gone, so it doesn't look slick and
  shiny. This film is dark, rich, and grungy. Very "noir-ish", and
  warm. Obviously the running gag through out the first film was
  that Porter wants his 70k back... not 130k or 1 million, just
  70k. This was maybe mentioned 3 or 4 times and that was it. The
  first cut seemed like it was being used more for comedy relief
  over and over and over again. Porter in this film is not charming
  or smooth. He's smart, violent, and cold. A true anti-hero. The
  annoying voice over narration is gone. There are several new
  characters, and several new brutal kills. Minus the credits, this
  film comes in at a brisk 1 hr and 25 minutes. This is a great
  companion piece to the great "To Live and Die in L.A." It got the
  same mood. I told you this review was going to be short.</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">Based on a true story and a book called
  EVIDENCE OF LOVE, this tv movie is made remarkable by the
  Emmy-winning performance of Barbara Hershey. She is utterly
  magnificent in the role of a middle class housewife who brutally
  murders her ex-lover's wife in a self defensive rage. Hershey
  superbly captures the many nuances of this seemingly normal woman
  who commits a heinous deed. Her hypnosis sequence is brutally
  painful and she pulls out no stops in showing us the hidden rage.
  Brian Dennehy is equally good as the lawyer who tries to get her
  out of her terrifying predicament. The movie is impressively done
  and once again worthy most of all for Ms. Hershey's dynamic
  presence</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">This disc is pure gold! Featuring a FULL
  live performance from their 2004 European tour and tons of
  classic and backstage footage this is the ultimate Stray Cats fan
  collectible! The concert documented on this disc is so satisfying
  you would think it was still the early 80's. They show almost no
  signs of age and you can tell they pour their heart out into the
  show. They go through all their classics and then some. Whether
  it's "Stray Cat Strut" "Gene And Eddie" or "Rumble In Brighton"
  what you see and hear on this disc is flawless. Must buy for ALL
  music fans, not just fans of the Cats</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">I have read many reviews stating that this
  remake is inferior to the orginal version of 1968. Granted, that
  version is marvelous. I have bought both versions and love them
  both. OK, it is difficult not to compare when watching. BUT I
  can't help wondering: if this version would have been the first I
  or anybody watched instead of the 1968 version, if people would
  have been complaining about that version? I can have different
  versions of Vivaldi's four seasons can't I? Actually for those
  among us who love classical music and opera it is quite common to
  have several versions of the same musical piece and enjoy them
  all (and I do understand that people can have preferences for one
  or the other). We would never say this or that piece is a remake
  of that version, would we? I have gone to the opera numerous
  times and watched Don Giovanni three times. Every time with
  different performers. Remake? Absolutely not. I think that the
  only reason one would have made this version of lion in winter is
  the wish to make it, because is such a great play. So, logically
  this would not be a remake! Why can't we watch this version for
  what it is and let go of the other (splendid 1968) version when
  doing so? That done, I must say I understand why Alais is in love
  with king Henry. Patrick Stewart is a very fine actor and has
  magnificent voice which he uses very well. He is a very good
  match to Close's queen. I did not care for Richard, I thought he
  was not commanding enough, bit whiny. I think John is a difficult
  part to play to say the least and I didn't care for him either,
  too much the idiot. Geoffrey on the other hand is really
  conniving and very good. King Philippe: too much a boy, although
  he has moments when the interaction with king Henry makes him
  interesting. Alais:good enough. Which of the versions do I
  prefer? that is difficult. I have highly enjoyed both. I think
  the 1968 version has a sharper edge because of Hepburn and I
  prefer her to Close. This version has a more emotional and
  sometimes romantic (Alais and Henry) approach. I definitely
  prefer Stewart to O'Toole, who seemed too young for the role. I
  liked the way Stewart made us see Henry's self confindence in his
  plans and his pleasure in manipulating and scheming (that is,
  until the end, when things turn out the wrong way and you see hem
  falling apart). O'Toole had a very serious approach all the time.
  On the other hand: Anthony Hopkins and Timothy Dalton were both
  splendid. I think overall that the 1968 version has a better
  supporting cast. Which of the versions I watch, depends on the
  mood I am in. I think they are both good in their own way.</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">This is an excellent film. A lot of the
  topics that were discussed in this film still happen at
  HBCU's!!!! As a matter of fact, the issue of lightskinned vs.
  darkskinned is still going on today, on a college campus or not.
  Spike Lee to me is one of the best film directors of all time. He
  is not afraid to tackle issues that are in the African American
  community. I highly recommend this film. If you haven't seen it,
  get the DVD. It's a classic</Text>

  <Text category="dvd">I thought this movie was great! It's
  definitely for the more cultured and intillectual movie-goer.
  It's probably the best dark comedy I've ever seen (only to rival
  the masterpiece that is &amp;amp;quot;Heathers&amp;amp;quot;).
  The dialog in this movie with leave you with one-liners for years
  to come. After seeing &amp;amp;quot;Party Girl&amp;amp;quot; I
  fell in love with Parker Posey, and when I saw this I loved her
  even more. This instantly became one of my favorite movies of all
  time, but then again I'm a huge fan of good dark comedies and I
  have a sick sense of humor. Everyone I know absolutely loved this
  move (including my MOM!) In any event, this is a definite
  must-see for any fan of Parker Posey and dark comedy.
  Excellent</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">Of course Dead Alive was the better movie.
  But I think the comparisons to the Peter Jackson masterpiece are
  appropriate, due to the fact that there is a high body count,
  lots of over-the-top splattery deaths, and annoying partygoers
  that end up as zombie killers, some as zombie lunch. Apparently
  there was some footage cut out for this release. I'm not sure if
  that was gore footage or not, but I would think gorehounds would
  like this one due to the overwhelming amount of onscreen
  violence. There is even some non-gore
  &amp;amp;quot;grossout&amp;amp;quot; humor (vomit-related, etc.)
  that reminded me of Bad Taste as well as Dead Alive. Sorry to run
  the Peter Jackson comparison into the ground, but again the
  influence is unquestionable. Don't expect the FX quality of Dead
  Alive though, this looked lower budget and some scenes were a
  little too dark to make out everything clearly. I don't know if
  this was the way the original film was shot or if it was the
  print/transfer, but it's a minor distraction. They did a great
  job with a relatively small budget. I echo the other reviewers
  who would like to see Ittenbach's other films on US (hopefully
  uncut) DVD release--I've heard Burning Moon is especially
  crazy</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">SIX DEGREES OF SEPARATION is an outstanding
  play transformed to the screen with dignity but with a script
  that keeps us in the live theatre instead of in a motion picture.
  Not that that is a bad thing: the script by John Guare is
  brilliant. It simply seems a little static, with its marvelous
  plays on words, repeated phrases, and disjointed movements
  significant unto themselves but not really taking advantage of
  cinematic possibilities of flow. Essentially the tale of how a
  married couple who deal art (Stockard Channing and Donald
  Sutherland - both in peak form) are so caught up in their
  superficial lives that they are taken in by a handsome young
  African American con artist (Will Smith) whose various antics
  bring the couple round to reexamining their shallow existence.
  Most of the story is related over art dealings and dinner
  conversations and are peopled by such luminaries as Kitty
  Carlisle, Ian McKellen, artists Chuck Close and Kazuko, Mary Beth
  Hurt, Bruce Davidson etc - a really fine ensemble. There are many
  social comments clustered in this story and it continues to play
  well after its origins on the stage and fifteen years after the
  movie was made. This was one of Will Smith's entries into film as
  well as one of the gifted Stockard Channing's finest roles.
  Highly recommended for repeated viewings. Grady Harp, October

  <Text category="dvd">I remember way back in '80 when this movie
  was the buzz of Hollywood. That is, the buzz on Johnny Carson.
  The media killed this movie before anybody had the chance to
  judge it for itself. Yet, in the mid 80's, it came out on both
  Betamax and VHS, and naturally I bought me a Beta copy to judge
  for myself what kind of a movie it was. First, it is not a drive
  in movie or one made for mass consumption. It is long and
  intraclly woven together. it is lavish and sometimes loud. It is
  a brutal slap in the face to "Manifest Destiny" and a cruel dig
  to the sickos that even today claim that this is "God's" country.
  As if their 'God" gave them wealth and privilige and that this
  God justifies revolution, massacre and war. Many comparisons can
  be mase with the America of the late 19th century and the America
  ruled presently by King George W. and his robber barons of
  Capitalism. But it is now, as then, much more conveniant to steer
  the "common man" into their churches, into their army, into their
  lies. The enemy is those "illegal aliens" those in the "gay
  agenda," those who dare to investigate or challenge the status
  quo. Kris Kristofferson plays a mayor/sherriff if wealth and
  means who (shock-shock) sides with the common man and the
  undertrodden. When another of his "breeding and class" challenges
  him on why he stands up for the underdogs and not his own class,
  he replies to the creep: "You are not of my class, to be of my
  class you first have to die and be born again!" This is a
  revolutionary movie, meant to be savored, each and every minute
  of it. This movie dares you to look at things usually not into
  history books or shown on the History Channel</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">if you love dancehall this movie has a bit

  full screen and shot in cheap video format, but it still shines
  despite these flaws. the soundtrack is very good despite
  containing no tracks from the aforementioned artists. i wonder if
  this is what ninjaman has been doing lately, because he does have
  quite a substantial role in this flick, and doesn't do bad at all

  <Text category="dvd">I'm very very picky about my action movies
  and this one is worth the trouble. Story line shmory line, this
  is an ACTION movie. I watch my action movies for action not a
  lesson in philosophy and religion. Kind of a heartbreaking movie,
  though, because he's dead no matter what. The man can't sleep or
  he slips in a coma. Going out with a bang with a freefall from a
  helicopter telling his woman how much he loved her... that's a
  film. You won't regret owning this, I promise you. p.s. It is

  <Text category="dvd">In this movie based on a true story we see
  Jerry Stahl played by Ben Stiller. Jerry is a geek Hollywood
  scriptwriter who turns out junk for sitcoms although he thinks he
  is Shakespeare by his admiration of his own writing. Jerry has it
  all- a Hollywood mansion, Liz Hurley, a cool car and yet he
  decides to throw it all away for some Heroin. Jerry's Heroin
  habit costs $6,000 a week but he is only earning $5000(!!!) per
  week. One does not need a Phd. in Advanced Mathematics to realize
  this this spells TROUBLE. Jerry eventually gets clean with the
  help of Maria Bello and then he wrote his story in a best selling
  book. One can only hope that his new fortune does not lure him
  back into the Drug Scene. I give this sorry excuse of a movie 5
  stars because it has Maria Bello in it although I still can't
  figure out why she finds Jerry The Geek so interesting. His story
  is the same as any Street Junkie.They all look the same to me
  when they are injecting Heroin into their veins on the

  doomed from the word &amp;amp;quot;go.&amp;amp;quot; A little

  <Text category="dvd">I stumbled across this movie on cable a
  couple of years ago, having nothing better to do I watched it. My
  first impression was that it would be just another stoner movie
  were nothing really happens. I was suprised though because not
  only does it have a plot it has a interesting plot. You don't
  have to be stoned, or even a stoner to enjoy this movie. One
  reveiwer said somthing along the lines of it looking like grade
  school kids made it. Well it is true it was an independent film
  made on the cheep but think it actualy adds something to the over
  all feel of the film, like your actualy there, scrapping through
  life with the characters. I guess I can understand why some
  people wouldnt get this movie, not enough bells and whisels, but
  if your up for something differnt give it a try. by the way, the
  movie was based on a book of the same name, also very good and
  differnt</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">If you're looking to hear Robert Johnson's
  songs, you should probably buy one of the awesome collections
  availible. As this legend and musical genius has now been dead
  for 65 years, I'm not sure what the other reviewers were looking
  for besides other people covering his songs, and talk about his
  life... that's all we have now. And of course the covers do not
  outdo him; that would be impossible. But there is some very
  thoughtful discussion on the life of Robert Johnson and the world
  he lived in. The discussion with a former classmate is touching,
  and the covers of his songs by those who knew him (Robert
  Lockwood Jr., Honeyboy Edwards)and by some of the new delta-blues
  talent such as Guy Davis, Roy Rogers and especially Alvin
  Youngblood Heart blew me away. Gov't Mule and Sonny Landreth do
  some awesome electric renditions of his work. The major let downs
  are the cuts into interviews and pointless displays of the rock
  n' roll hall of fame gathering, and also Bob Weir's performance,
  which is just plain bad. All in all, it is a good film, and it's
  nice to actually be able to watch people play his music, as we
  will never be able to see the real thing</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">I had heard about this flick being talked
  about as the Chinese Charlie's Angels. It took me a while but I
  finally popped it in. WOW, this has to be on of the coolest
  movies I have seen in a while. I was expecting a chick flick but
  maybe that is why I liked it so much. The story is about these 2
  women who have kind of a stupid backround story but what they do
  now is assasinate people for a living. Sweet! I am not going to
  lie, I wasn't paying attention to the story what so ever the
  first time i saw this because of how hot these women are. Add in
  a super hot cop who wants to take them down, and you have
  yourself one of the funnest movie ever. All of these girls know
  martial arts, or at least they can put their legs up really high
  and director Corey Yuen puts in some of the best wirework I have
  seen. This movie certainly isn't going to win any awards for it's
  high amount of cheese injected in the plot but it is a movie that
  I wish I could fill my room with about 100 diffrerent screen shot
  posters. So on top of this being an amazingly fun movie, Yasuaki
  Kurata shows up for the finale!!!!!!! Corey Yuen goes all out
  with this one and puts together truly one of the best screen
  battles of all time that will rival any old school kung fu movie.
  If you have seen some of Coery's 80's stuff like Yes Madam or
  even the newer Fong Sai Yuk then get ready to be taken back some
  years when Corey did some of the best action sequences in the
  history of cinema(Example:Ninja in the Dragon's Den). Kurata
  plays a great character in my favorite movie ever, Legend of a
  Fighter which was made in 1981. Well at 56 years old he looks
  just as good!!!! I was so amazed by this movie I have watched it
  3 nights in a row and I will continue this routine for a while:)
  The picture quality on the Columbia Tristar version is perfect

  <Text category="dvd">It is almost ashame that North Amercian
  culture needs Bill Maher. After all, shouldn't honest yet
  entertaining social commentary be a little bit more available
  then it currently is? On Victory Begins At Home, Maher creates
  entertainment by basically speaking his mind. Maher's central
  premise that the War On Terrorism can be aided by what people do
  in the United States really is almost a common sense arguement.
  Yet Maher is so uniquely unapologetic about what he says and how
  he presents it, the commentary and comedy bristle with an energy
  that few comedians can match. Maher does this by not pretending
  he isn't politically opinated, in fact that is what bases his
  comedy completely on, the rarity of straight-forward unabashed
  opinion. On Victory Begins At Home he is more Democrat then
  Republican, but he openly sides with neither. Instead, he rails
  at all presenting himself as a full person, neither liberal nor
  conservative, right-wing or left-wing. The end result is an
  engaging and unique look at culture that seems unfiltered. There
  is no spin here, what Maher realizes is that no spin is funny in
  a world full of it. With all the spin that is normally doled out
  by the news media, political columnists and special interest
  groups, know wonder we need him so much.</Text>

  say Charlie Brown should have gotten as many valentines as the

  was swell because it wasn't as sad. On this one, Charlie Brown
  seems to go after the little red haired girl through most of it.

  <Text category="dvd">WOW! This was a pretty decent romantic
  comedy. We had this in our collection for months (Possibly years)
  and never watched it. We decided to watch this film on a whim. I
  have to say that it was better and ever funnier than I thought it
  would be. Monica Potter is great in her role. It's a sweet movie
  that actually doesn't do to much guy bashing (the reason so many
  guys hate romantic comedies). I am also a big fam of Henry
  Thomas, and he is great at as well. I won't go into the plot
  here, as many others already have. But what I am simply amazed
  with as many bad romantic comedies that get released in theatres
  (Sweet Home Alabama &amp;amp; 13 Going on 30) that a movie like
  this never got mainstream attention. The other thing that must be
  said is, with virtually no cute romatic female leads under 40
  (and over 18), why isn't Monica Potter more famous than she is.
  She can easily be the next Julia Roberts, or Meg Ryan. Julia has
  2 kids and Meg has just hit the wall, it's time for a beauty like
  Monica Potter to get into the very lucrative Romantic Comedy
  genre. Here's hoping she gets a better agent before it's to late.

  <Text category="dvd">Made in 1959, Douglas Sirk's Imitation of
  Life is still just as evocative and as gorgeous to look today as
  it was almost 50 years ago. It's a real cinematic treat,
  shameless tearjerker, and an unabashed melodrama that dares to
  confront head-on issues of racism and the problems of motherhood
  at the stage when one's teenagers - in this case daughters--are
  growing up and preparing to enter the world. Lana Turner has
  never looked more ravishing as Lora Meredith, a young New York
  widow who will do anything to realize her dreams of Broadway
  stardom. Together with her young daughter Susie, they live in a
  squalid apartment eking out a hand-to-mouth existence, their
  futures fuelled by unfulfilled dreams. One day at Coney Island,
  Lora and Susie meet another a white girl Sarah Jane, who is being
  taken care of by a black woman, Annie Johnson (Juanita Moore),
  whom Lora mistakes for the maid. When told by her that she's the
  mother, the surprised Lora falters but then accepts it without a
  question as if it were a natural thing that a black woman has a
  white child. The angelic and virtuous Annie asks Lora if she can
  come and help out around the apartment. Lora is initially
  hesitant - not because of Annie's race but because she's
  struggling and doesn't have any money to pay her a wage.
  Eventually, however, she relents and tells Annie that her and her
  daughter can stay for one night. At the same time, Lora meets the
  extremely fine-looking wannabe photographer, Steve Archer (John
  Gavin). Steve takes an instant liking to Lora and offers to marry
  her. But Lora is far too concerned with realizing her acting
  dreams to be stifled by a man and by marriage. Meanwhile, the
  saintly Annie is troubled that her daughter is ashamed of being
  black and tries to pass herself off in school as white. Imitation
  of Life follows these characters throughout their lives, with
  Sirk piling on the sentiment and melodrama every chance he can
  get. Lora does indeed become a famous Broadway actress, yet
  neglects her growing daughter in the process. Steve goes on to
  become a president of a large photographic organization, but has
  trouble relating to Lora's need to be independent and famous.
  Annie's heart is eventually broken, gradually worn down by years
  of emotional abuse from her daughter. Sara Jane is so angry at
  being labeled as black that she repudiates her mother and
  ultimately runs away. Annie always stays the subservient and
  loyal maid; whilst her best friend and employer goes on to bask
  in a lush and international success. The contrast of the mother's
  compensations from their conflicting daughters is the story's
  ultimate paradox. Lora, Annie, Steve and the two girls seem to be
  victims of each other. They all want to follow their own dreams
  and forge their own paths in life even when it doesn't seem to be
  doing them much good. They are also surprisingly oblivious of how
  manipulated they are by the world around them. Lora gets her
  career but she's unlucky in love and terminally insecure as a
  mother, Whilst Sara Jane - perhaps the most damaged character -
  achieves her ambition to pass herself off as a white girl, but at
  great personal cost to both her and her aging mother. Under
  Douglas Sirk's accomplished direction, Miss Turner et al acts
  ornately and elaborately, everything is over emphasized to within
  an inch of its life, especially Lana's gorgeous outfits, yet the
  film - clocking in at over two hours - is always compelling and
  is never boring. The screenplay is sophisticated, the themes are
  brave and tempting and the look of the film - the brilliant
  surfaces, audacious colors, and the spatial complexities of 50s
  moderne architecture - bring to the forefront a bittersweet world
  of fantasy, entrapment, and emotional anxiety, and where the
  price of following one's dreams eventually comes at a harsh and
  desultory cost. Mike Leonard June 06.</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">In 1987 and 1988, JIM HENSON'S THE
  STORYTELLER aired and became an instant showpiece for television,
  a truimphant (but short-lived) series breathing fresh life into
  nine lesser-known northern European fairy tales and, later, into
  four timeless stories drawn from Greek mythology. These old folk
  and fairy tales, mined from countries such as Germany and Russia
  and compiled in 2 discs here, along with the Greek tales, are
  vigorously and appealingly narrated by two storytellers: John
  Hurt for the European fables and Michael Gambon for the Greek
  re-tellings. But, with much respect to Mr. Gambon, who himself
  does a fine job, it is John Hurt who decidedly draws my
  attention. Hurt, with the more eye-catching portrayal, is ideal
  as he inhabits his storytelling character with a gleeful and
  quirky charm and a mischievous twinkle in his eyes. It doesn't
  hurt that the stories featuring Hurt as the host boast clever and
  sensitive screenplays written by Anthony Minghella, who, nearly a
  decade later, would win an Oscar for directing THE ENGLISH
  PATIENT. As such, JIM HENSON'S THE STORYTELLER gloriously lives
  up to its titular billing. John Hurt's performance sparkles with
  his enchanting delivery as, propelled by his captivating voice
  and effectively off-kilter mannerisms and abetted by heavy
  make-up, he evokes a rich verbal miasma which sucks the listener
  in to his stories. Minghella's screenplays are replete with rich,
  witty wordplay and evocative descriptives that indeed recall to
  mind the classic fairy tales with which we grew up. The kids, of
  course, won't have that frame of reference, but, still, watching
  these episodes, it really does feel as if you're sitting around
  the fire, enraptured at the feet of a master spinner of yarns.
  Michael Gambon, on the other hand, is burdened with the weightier
  and grimmer Greek tales. Thus, he eschews John Hurt's light,
  ebullient touch, opting instead to display a more proper and
  somber persona. He's pretty good, mind you, but, in the final
  analysis, he ends up lacking a bit of something when compared to
  John Hurt. Both Hurt and Gambon, by the way, are accompanied by
  the same mangy talking dog (as operated by Brian Henson). At a
  half hour per episode, JIM HENSON'S THE STORYTELLER is presented
  in a marriage of live acting, creative animatronics, and surreal
  and stylishly vivid imagery. Jim Henson and his crew do a
  marvelous job with the production values, coming up with
  excellent special effects (for its time), seamless puppetry,
  matte paintings, and yeoman make-up work, all to plant the viewer
  firmly in their fantasy setting. A charming quirk of the series,
  which adds a nice touch, is the interesting ways the folk tale
  would continue to make its presence felt during the occasional
  interludes with the Storyteller and his dog. The camera would cut
  away from the story and focus on our host by the fireplace, but,
  somewhere in the background, whether it's on a painting in the
  back or on the surface of a display jar or cup, images depicting
  the story are set in motion. Pretty neat. The stories themselves
  are more mature and darker in essence than any kid's fable we're
  used to over here, especially the Greek entries, and several
  carry melancholy and bittersweet overtones ("The Soldier and
  Death," "The Heartless Giant"). But don't keep the kids from
  watching this series; everyone should get a chance to fall under
  the spell and feel the power of stories. It does help that most
  of these tales are little known in the States, thereby giving the
  viewer a chance to enjoy the unfolding of a fresh story and be
  actually startled here and there. When was the last time
  CINDERELLA or BEAUTY AND THE BEAST, timeless as they are, offer
  up anything new? This is just about as perfect as television
  shows can get; the only flaw I can come up with lies in the dvd
  set as it comes with no special features whatsoever. ALL the
  episodes are superb, but if I had to pick the best of the pack, I
  would definitely go with "Hans My Hedgehog," "The Soldier and
  Death" and "The Three Ravens." With several recognizable name
  actors lending their talents to this series, JIM HENSON'S THE
  STORYTELLER: THE DEFINITIVE COLLECTION truly is a MUST HAVE dvd
  set.
  **************************************************************************
  SPOILERS follow. The nine European fables: "Hans My Hedgehog" -
  From an early German folk tale: A barren peasant woman,
  desperately craving a child, naively says aloud that if she had a
  baby, she wouldn't care what it looks like. Soon enough, she
  gives birth to a baby who resembles a hedgehog, much to the
  father's dismay and the scorn of the villagers. "Fearnot" - From
  an early German folk tale: A carefree, absent-minded boy who
  never scares goes on a strange journey to learn fear. Though
  still very good, this may be the weakest episode of the lot.
  Gabrielle Anwar has a tiny nonspeaking role. "A Story Short" -
  From an early Celtic folk tale: The Storyteller himself is in the
  spotlight as he narrates the time he was caught making a fool of
  the royal cook and, as punishment meted out by the king, must
  tell one story a day for a year. All goes well until the very
  last day when the Storyteller suffers from storyteller's block.
  Brenda Blethyn has a part. "The Luck Child" - From an early
  Russian folk tale: Seeking to avert a prophecy which foretells of
  a seventh son of a seventh son of someday supplanting the current
  king, the unscrupulous monarch seeks out this luck child and
  attempts to do away with him. But those blessed with luck cannot
  be undone...and the same could be said for prophecies. The
  Soldier &amp;amp; Death" - From an early Russian folk tale, this
  is an awesome story. Because of kind acts towards three beggars,
  an honest soldier returning from war is given a magical sack, a
  deck of cards, and a nice whistle, which he uses to save a
  kingdom and to foil Death. "The True Bride" - From an early
  German folk tale. Shades of Aslan! A white lion comes to the aid
  of a girl (Jane Horrocks, LITTLE VOICE) being held under the
  cruel care of a troll. Co-starring Sean Bean. "The Three Ravens"
  - From an early German folk tale: A wicked witch (Miranda
  Richardson) weds a widowed king (Jonathan Pryce) and then,
  recognizing that the king's three sons and daughter pose a threat
  to her ambition, transforms the three sons into ravens. But the
  princess (Joely Richardson) escapes and is told by her brothers
  that, unless she remains speechless for three years, three
  months, and three days, they'll be trapped in their raven forms
  forever. "Sapsorrow" - From an early German folk tale: This is a
  variant on Cinderella (or is it the other way around?) as a
  beautiful princess (the unimpressive Alison Doody), seeking to
  escape an arranged marriage, flees to a distant kingdom and
  disguises herself as a loathsome hag. But, then, she falls in
  love with the prince...Co-starring Jennifer Saunders. "The
  Heartless Giant" - From an early German folk tale: On the whole,
  giants are benign creatures, harmless to none, unless, of course,
  the giant hasn't a heart. This story is about a curious prince
  who is fooled into freeing one such heartless giant from the
  king's dungeon... The Greek myths: "Daedalus and Icarus" - The
  inventor Daedalus and his son Icarus flee from the wicked King
  Minos with the aid of Daedalus's man-made wings, but will Icarus
  heed his father's advice? I'm guessing, not. "Orpheus and
  Eurydice" - The musician Orpheus descends to Hades to bring back
  his dead wife. "Perseus and the Gorgon" - The hero Perseus faces
  the Gorgon, Medusa. "Theseus and the Minotaur" - It's Theseus,
  with some help from a beautiful princess, versus the savage
  Minotaur, half-man, half-bull.</Text>

  <Text category="dvd">"The Talons of Weng Chiang" is a wonderfully
  creepy pseudo-historical tale full of mood, atmosphere, and an
  unusual amount of violence for "Doctor Who"--almost as if
  departing producer Philip Hinchcliffe was taking a parting shot
  at his critics on his way out. But it's not all gloom and doom.
  This storyline is a fine mix indeed of good old "Doctor Who"
  humor at its funniest as well as thrilling "Doctor Who" adventure
  at its most gruesome. The dank and dour city streets and slums of
  late-19th century London make a grim backdrop for a tale of
  manipulation, madness, and serial murder (technologically refined
  cannibalism, really), and yet the Doctor's many clever quips and
  Leela's naively astute observations on "civilized" Victorian life
  keeps the viewer laughing throughout, and the main villain's
  second-hand man, Li-Hsen Chang, has some incredibly witty
  one-liners as well. Li-Hsen Chang himself is a fascinating
  character, delightfully entertaining on stage and yet cold and
  ruthless in his service to "Weng-Chiang," a stranded,
  time-traveling dictator from the future who has deceived Chang
  into believing he's a deity from the Taoist pantheon. Chang's
  paranormal powers, foremost of which is hypnotism, definitely
  evoke the late Victorian fascination with mesmerism (see the
  poster advertising his show) and serve to mark him as a clever
  echo of the evil Fu Manchu characters so much the stock villains
  of pulp fiction, and yet he's also a tragic figure in many
  ways--a healthy, innocent rural farmer whose simple religious
  beliefs were abused by an evil man--uprooted and given
  extraordinary powers along with refinement and authority by his
  "god" and yet irrevocably corrupted in the process. In many ways
  this works as a dark counterpoint to the Pygmalion-style
  educational program the Doctor's putting Leela through, to her
  annoyance. If Li-Hsen Chang is an interesting and complex
  adversary though, the same can't really be said for his master,
  Weng-Chiang himself. He's a rather unremarkable two-dimensional
  villain, I'm afraid, complete with hokey bad-guy laugh and
  over-the-top acting. Perhaps the writers were going for a sort of
  campy effect, but if so, they overdid it just a bit. At times too
  he's just more annoying than frightening--every time the ever
  loyal Li-Hsen is faithfully going about their nefarious business
  only to be thwarted by the Doctor, Weng-Chiang throws a fit,
  savagely berating the poor guy on and on ad nauseum. On this
  score, Weng-Chiang is less evil incarnate than a bad reminder of
  some dysfunctional manager at one's workplace. It doesn't help
  either that he bears no resemblance whatsoever to the clean-cut
  bureaucratic deity of education whom he's presumably
  impersonating, so that the whole idea comes across as altogether
  somewhat unconvincing. All in all, though, this is an enjoyable
  adventure. The Doctor is at his sleuthing best, Leela shines as a
  displaced neolithic warrior, and a fine complement of vividly
  memorable supporting characters keep the story moving right along
  in an entertaining fashion, all of them brought to life by a fine
  script and even finer acting. And anyway, Li-Hsen more than makes
  up for Weng-Chiang's deficiencies as an interesting villain for
  most of the show, while the cyborg assassin Mr. Sin is genuinely
  creepy (especially if you have a phobia of ventriloquist dolls).
  So this is a fine storyline altogether as long as you take some
  of it with a grain of salt--or a dash of soy sauce, rather</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen was
  based on a pretty good graphic novel and as a movie, its pretty
  good itself. Where else could you ever hope to see the likes of
  Captain Nemo, Dorin Gray, Mina Harker, the Invisible Man, Dr.
  Jeckyl/Mr. Hyde, Allan Quatermain &amp;amp; Tom Sawyer all in the
  same movie? About the only character the production is lacking is
  Sherlock Holmes. The action and special effects in this movie are
  outstanding as are the performances from most of the actors. The
  only real drawback is the length. About 30 minutes could be
  excised from this movie without deleting any key scenes. All in
  all, a good popcorn flick.</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">5 stars to the film itself! Here's a painful
  study of a woman's descent to lunacy amidst a desolate, uncaring
  and eventually foreboding backdrop of industrial waste. The
  character study is not unlike claustrophobic Polanski's Repulsion
  but dwells on Vitti's being consumed by her external surroundings
  as opposed to Deneuve's intensive plunge to schizophrenia. The
  pace and landscape is virtual Antonioni so it may not appeal to
  viewers who are not familiar with the director's works. One of
  his greatest works (L'Avventura remains his best to me). The only
  problem is the DVD transfer. I've seen the VHS and it has a
  consistent hue of orange. The DVD, although sharper and clearer,
  fluctuates in hues from blues in medium shots to reds and oranges
  in long shots. For a film that essentially deals with color (it
  was Antonioni's first color feature), the transfer was rather
  clumsy and careless. The sound is average but leaves a lot of
  room for improvement. Why didn't Criterion handle the transfer of
  this gorgeous film</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">Sure, the pacing is slow compared to today's
  hyper/cyber entertainments, but Antonioni's visuals are still
  incomparable. Scene after scene resembles nothing so much as a
  Matisse canvas, and the final shot is a stunner. Lovely, achingly
  felt picture</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">I'm not sure if the drills in this video are
  really championship calibre. However, most of the drills that I
  used with my team were effective. This video is for the first or
  second year Junior High coach (like myself) or any coach on the
  recreational level (ie. CYO and/or PAL coach or just in your
  driveway with your son or daughter). They are not too difficult
  to follow and supplementary drills can be created easily enough.
  The narrator uses the expression "dual purpose" drills which
  translates into getting more than one benefit from any drill.
  Combining shooting along with conditioning is used in most of the
  shooting drills. For instance, a drill with 3 players, one
  shooter, one rebounder and one passer. A simple drill but after
  the shooter shoots, he sprints to the wall and then back to his
  spot. The timing is such that when he gets back to his spot, the
  passer is already passing the ball. Thought this aspect of the
  drill was just staged for the video but when I tried it, it
  worked great! Other drills also worked well like "shots across
  the lane" and a few of the rebounding drills. The explanations
  were mostly of the drills themselves and not too much on the X's
  and 0's. Added tips are given if you listen close enough and the
  foul shooting and regular shooting techniques are discussed in a
  clear concise manner which turned out to be my favorite part of
  the video. The drills are forty five seconds to about a minute
  long. The sample practices given at the end of the video will be
  extremely helpful to any recreational coach. The video could have
  been more detailed with more theory (which I like), but in truth,
  it gives you just what it says. Some very good drills along with
  a superior format for a sports instructional video make this a
  buy</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">How did he have the time to write such a
  picture, to co-direct it, to act in it and after everything else
  to write its score? Noel Coward's energies, always remarkable,
  were redoubled during the second World War, and it must have
  seemed like another excuse to show off his patriotism, which he
  wore like a second skin despite his slummy upbringing. IN WHICH
  WE SERVE is still worth watching, but it's nowhere as appealing
  as either CAVALCADE or THIS HAPPY BREED, and its focus on the
  "life and death of a ship" (the HMS Torrin) is strangely
  monomaniacal, almost constructivist. Over and over you see
  unattributed bare arms hammmering away, symbols of brute strength
  like something from a Soviet film. The ship goes up. The ship
  goes down. A new ship rises out of the water. And in between
  Coward tries his hardest to keep you interested in the lives of
  the men clinging to the lifeboat, till our interest settles on
  three--Bernard Miles as Hardy, with his striking, long, hatchet
  face and the deep voice that goes with it--he should have played
  Ichabod Crane--John Mills as Blake, a tiny little pipsqueak who's
  feisty in the standard Mickey Rooney-Jimmy Cagney manner, and
  Noel Coward himself as Captain Kinross, tranquil with class
  privilege and, in the background, his glamorous marriage to the
  ineffable Celia Johnson (so beautiful till she opens her mouth
  and those bits of teeth wobble around on her gums). Hitchcok's
  LIFEBOAT had the same concentration on a handful of downed and
  wet actors playing nautical, but without Coward's complicated
  flashback structure. Coward stalwarts Joyce Carey and Kay Walsh
  show up as the love interests for Miles and Mills
  respectively--Carey, in this movie and in BRIEF ENCOUNTER as
  well, treated very unusually for the 1940s as a woman not in her
  first youth, nor good-looking in any way, who's given
  nevertheless a fullblooded and physical romantic interest. She
  must have kissed the ground every time Noel Coward walked on it.
  Who else would have written such roles for her? The movie is
  trying indeed when it goes "serious," and yet that's half the fun
  of it, seeing how often Coward plays the "race" card--"we are an
  island race" indeed. I teared up, of course I did, during the
  Blitz as the V-1 rockets drop bomb after bomb on London
  households, leading to the death of several favorite characters,
  and again when Coward leads his naval boys into Dunkirk and out
  of it again with a panoply of half-nude British soldiers sipping
  tea or what looks like an enormous vat of Kool-Aid. Outside of
  these scenes, however, the movie is marred by its agitprop and by
  David Lean's tiresomeness, in showing everything at such a
  glacial pace. PS, the film was shot by Ronald Neame who later
  became a director himself and whose "masterpiece," THE POSEIDON
  ADVENTURE, sometimes seems like a shot by shot remake of the
  disaster sequences of IN WHICH WE SERVE</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">Like Stuart Gordon's other venture into
  science fiction territory, the underrated and ill-fated ROBOT
  JOX, this is a nifty little film that was plagued by production
  difficulties and failed to find a theatrical distributor, which
  is a shame because its quite an enjoyable viewing experience.
  Everyone joins in the fun in this one, with Dennis Hopper
  delivering some unexpectedly funny bits of dialog, Debi Mazar and
  Stephen Dorff providing reliable 2nd banana support and Charles
  Dance having the time of his life with his horny half-metal
  madman. This Excellent DVD offers a chance to see this little
  sleeper in a great looking print with a fascinating and funny
  commentary by the Director.</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">This is the first movie I remember seeing as
  a kid. I LOVED it. It was my favorite. Then, I didn't get to see
  it again for several years (stupid Blockbuster!) When I finally
  saw it again, I STILL liked it. I like it as I write this very
  day. The music is good (the background music behind the movie
  that nobody really conciously listens to, but helps the mood
  anyway). The animation's good, too. And I ACTUALLY KNOW WHAT I'M
  TALKING ABOUT! (How often does that happen?) See, what happens a
  lot of the time, is that people blame colors they don't like, or
  designs that are annoying, or WHATEVER on the animation. But it
  isn't the animation's fault! The way the thing on-screen MOVES is
  the only thing the animators do, mostly. So, if you really want
  to criticize the animation, look at how they MOVE, not what they
  look like. Do you see? I think that, really, most of the reason
  that this is one of my favorite movies is that it is about BOOKS.
  When I was little, my dad read me "The Lion, the Witch, and the
  Wardrobe" and "The Hobbit"; things like that. So, naturally, I
  loved books and stories. This is practically the only movie I've
  seen that encourages reading so much while still being sincere.
  It's obvious that the filmmakers themselves (or at least, a lot
  of the people working on it) actually like to read. THAT'S really
  why I like the Pagemaster. So, if you like to read, watch this
  movie. If you don't (you utter nincompoop), stay away, and don't
  criticize what you have no comprehension of</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">This is an imaginative take on the Jack and
  the Beanstalk story. While it was apparently made for kids, the
  story maintains enough complexity to keep adults interested (I'm
  19). Plus as a female, I appreciate the fact that it's one of the
  few stories where (possible spoiler) the damsel (who's in a
  different kind of distress than other fairy tale women) rescues
  Prince Charming. Well-acted, it features some great chemistry
  between Sara and Modine. But I still can't give it 5 stars.
  Here's why (spoilers ahead): 1. I'm no math person but why
  couldn't the writers be consistent with when Jack's dad died? One
  minute, they say he died 20 years ago but then they say he died
  when Jack was 14. Since Jack is 37, it shows that the writers
  can't do simple addition. Couldn't they just take two seconds to
  do the math? 2. How the hell does Siggy know about goose and
  harp? I got the impression from Wilhemina that Jack's dad didn't
  believe the story of the original Jack. But apparently, Jack's
  dad told Siggy not to tell him about the family's dark secret
  until he was ready. I wish there was a more believable
  explanation for Siggy knowing a lot more than he should. 3. If
  Siggy is smart enough to know the all the Robinson secrets, I
  think he should be able to catch on to the fact that Jack is in
  love with Ondine fairly quickly. I always wondered why he didn't
  try to kill Ondine when he was so against Jack having an heir. I
  understand that they had a time limit to the movie and maybe it
  would have been a bit scary for the little ones. Don't get me
  wrong, I don't want Ondine to die. I wanted nothing less than a
  happy ending for her and Jack. But shooting her (or at least
  threatening her) would have been a great way to kick up the
  tension/suspense. 4. Siggy's accent and mannerisms were an
  attempt at comedy that completely fell flat. It was not funny and
  was a bit gratuitous. But if you're a fan of romance, adventure,
  or just feel-good movies in general, those things shouldn't keep
  you from enjoying this film. Don't think too much about the plot
  holes- you'll go insane if you do</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">How families fall apart and mend themselves
  is the point of this star-laden 1996 movie, but stage and TV
  director Jerry Zaks, screenwriter Scott McPherson, and a trio of
  fine performances transcend the formulaic aspects to come up with
  something more resonant. Based on a play by McPherson before he
  succumbed to AIDS, the semi-autobiographical plot focuses on two
  estranged, middle-aged sisters. In Florida, mousey spinster
  Bessie has spent twenty years as caretaker to their ailing father
  Marvin and their eccentric aunt Ruth. In Ohio, Lee escaped family
  responsibility to get married and raise two sons in Ohio only to
  see things fall apart. Lee is on the verge of turning her life
  around as a licensed cosmetologist when Bessie is diagnosed with
  leukemia and reaches out to Lee and her sons as potential
  bone-marrow transplant candidates. The rest of the movie is
  mainly about how the sisters cope with each other when they
  reunite and what they do to deal with the inevitable.
  Intriguingly, while the soap opera elements are strictly
  by-the-numbers, there is a persistent undercurrent of black
  comedy that effectively blunts the potential sentimentality of
  the piece. It also helps that Meryl Streep and Diane Keaton play
  the sisters. As the embittered, guilt-ridden Lee, Streep moves
  easily back into blue-collar, Silkwood territory, and she
  unapologetically shows the edginess and jealousy of her
  self-centered character. However, it's a vanity-free Keaton who
  really radiates as Bessie finding inner strength and contentment
  under increasingly dire circumstances. A year before "Titanic",
  Leonardo di Caprio effectively plays the last of his juvenile
  hellions as Lee's oldest son Hank, a textbook example of
  teenaged, pyromaniac angst. The rest of the cast is fine in
  limited turns - Robert DeNiro (one of the producers as well) as
  the bumbling Dr. Wally; Dan Hedaya as his even more pixilated
  brother Bob; Gwen Verdon as wild-eyed, soap opera-obsessed Aunt
  Ruth; Hal Scardino as Hank's self-controlled little brother
  Charlie; and Hume Cronyn, who is forced to play Marvin with
  severely limited expression. There are predictable moments
  throughout, but some surprise and a few actually enthrall,
  including a seriocomic scene of quiet reconciliation when Bessie
  recalls the drowning death of her open-mouthed carny boyfriend.
  There are no extras with the 1999 DVD release</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">I'll get to the plot of "The Gang's All
  Here" in a minute, because the plot isn't the most memorable part
  of this movie. The most memorable part is the bananas. About 20
  minutes into the movie, a towering hat of Technicolor
  fruitappears on the screen, followed by its owner--"Brazilian
  bombshell" Carmen Miranda. She proceeds to do a number called
  "The Lady in the Tutti-Frutti Hat," accompanied by chorus girls
  who bear bananas. Six-foot-tall bananas that continuously droop
  and sprout until number's end, when the chorus girls, worn out by
  the burden of this mutated fruit, lay down for a long siesta on a
  stage dressed up like an island. There's a reason this number
  occurs so early on: It takes you the rest of the movie to
  convince yourself you actually saw this in a 1943 movie. But
  then, this is Busby Berkeley, a director who staged his musical
  numbers as though he was declaring war. And next to kitsch, war
  is pretty much the motivator here. The wafer-thin story involves
  Andy (James Ellison), a soldier who woos and wins Edie (Alice
  Faye), a canteen dancer, the nightbefore Andy goes off to World
  War Two. In what seems an instant, Andy gets decorated and
  returned home to a victory party thrown by the family of Andy's
  childhood sweetheart and fiancee--who, unfortunately for Edie, is
  not Edie. Will the heartbreak be resolved? Do you really care?
  The plot is mostly an excuse for some snappy repartee between
  major '40s stars (in particular, Eugene Pallette and Edward
  Everett Horton are hilarious), and the kind of musical numbers
  that seem to drop out of thin air. (In a couple of scenes, Benny
  Goodman and his orchestra stroll by and do some songs just for
  the heck of it.) "The Gang's All Here" is really a 1943 time
  capsule, but an eye-popping rouser of one. They don't make 'em
  like this anymore. They didn't make 'em much like this back then,
  either</Text>

  advances only exemplifies the rest of the good points of the
  movie. This probably could have gotten the remaining 0.5 points
  (going by the KAB scale, of course), except I was really hoping
  that the filmmakers would have explored the stern section of the
  ship, which, I believe was supposed to be located a half mile
  away from the bow section. The KAB score: 9.5</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">I didn't give this five stars because it's
  some kind of Oscar-worthy achievement, but if you are a fan of
  the quirky, B-grade fantasy genre that had its heyday in the late
  seventies to late eighties, then this film is a must. "Hawk"
  offers hilarious jump-cut editing, dialogue that is spectacular
  in its badness, and probably the most memorable elf character
  ever put to film. For all that, the film is also remarkable for
  its innocence, in a time when cheesecake T&amp;amp;A fantasy like
  "The Sword and the Sorceress" and the infamous "Deathstalker"
  series were the norm, "Hawk the Slayer" keeps it clean, and is
  all the funnier for it. If you have the right sort of friends,
  then snap this gem up, invite them over for beer and pizza, and
  have a go. It's more than worth it</Text>

  introduced to anime through my daughter. Some of it is fluffy
  love stories or improbable characters or situations that appear
  from nowhere to solve the day. Full Metal is none of these. The
  characters are believable even when they are a talking metal suit
  of armor. Ed and Al are young boys. Their mother dies. They
  desparately want her back. They do something forbidden. They pay.
  And they learn what the costs are. The world is a confusing
  place. They navigate, sometimes on their own and sometimes with
  people who they meet along the way. Not everyone is who they seem
  at the start. Finally they confront the costs of their and other
  peoples violations of the rules. Through the story there is humor
  and growth. The story is told from their point of view. They do
  not give in to the tragedies that surround them and keep fighting
  for the truth and for each other. I highly recommend this series
  for young teens and old fogies (that's me). Much better than most
  things available for teens these days. I rank this up with Dante
  and Faust as literature about pacts made by people not
  understanding the full consequences of their actions fighting to

  objects would have been nice! but still its great and colorfull
  with all the lights on stage</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">It seems to me there's a certain type of
  photographic quality in most of the 80s movies that sets them
  apart from any other era. I'm not arguing it's either better or
  worse than others, it just feels different and very distinctive.
  In this light, "Wall Street" reminded me vividly of "No Way Out"
  for instance - which happens to be from 1987 as well - and
  several De Palma films. Don't ask me why. It just does. Useless
  considerations apart, "Wall Street", directed by always
  controversial Oliver Stone, pictures the almighty frenzy in
  corridors of high finance where no one has a chance to fade away.
  They always burn out, in a snap of fingers. And bigger they are,
  harder they fall, right? The story in itself is nothing new or
  previously unseen, featuring a bright young "sport", Bud Fox
  (played by Charlie Sheen) who happens to have a lot of potential
  but is not exactly happy with his stock broker life. He wants
  more, and hotshot Gordon Gekko (Michael Douglas) is another
  broker who embodies everything he wants to become - powerful,
  vicious, influential and a sure winner. By sheer force of will
  and unprecedented persistence, Bud sneaks into Gekko's office and
  tries to prove his value to him. From here on the bulk of the
  movie shows us the average - but rather well executed in this
  particular instance - story of the young proteg&#239;&#191;&#189;
  who rises to the top at breakneck speed until, unexpectedly,
  something shatters his bond to the master. Something that hits
  home and makes Bud question his beliefs. What this is and how it
  plays out is the very heart of the movie, so I'll let that for
  you to find out if you didn't see it yet. All the acting is quite
  superb, especially the relationship between Gekko and Fox. Martin
  Sheen - who is Charlie Sheen's father both in real life and on
  the screen - is particularly compelling as a man who believes in
  hard work, not selling out and not letting others - and yourself
  - down. He reminds me of Donald Sutherland simply because he also
  seems to have that ability to outshine everyone whenever he's on
  screen a couple of minutes at a time. If you like high finance
  intrigue, big guys pulling the strings on each other, twists and
  turns, then "Wall Street" is probably essential. And it will
  probably give you an excuse to read Sun Tzu's "The Art of
  War"</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">I'm Not sure if anyone has pointed this out

  was also confirmed by paul proir to the movies release</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">In response to the earlier reviewer, this is
  Sergio Garrone's Django il Bastardo, not the other film the
  reviewer mentioned. Django il Bastardo is a small gem among
  Spaghetti Westerns, a low budget B movie in which a ghost
  (Django) avenges his own death (a topic later adapted by Clint
  Eastwood for his &amp;amp;quot;High Plains
  Drifter&amp;amp;quot;). Hence, Steffen's
  &amp;amp;quot;wooden&amp;amp;quot; acting is totally appropriate
  for the role. A little jewel with nice gothic atmosphere,
  innovative camera tricks and good supporting actors (a standout
  is Luciano Rossi as the main baddie's insane brother)</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">This thoughtfully prepared collection of 3
  Buster Keaton movies, 2 shorts from early and late in his
  pre-feature period, and the feature Seven Chances, show a wide
  range of comedy styles, from slapstick, to more refined visual
  humor, to what we would today call situation comedy, where laughs
  come from unusual or embarrassing encounters. The earliest in the
  collection, "Neighbors" from 1920 is in some way the most
  satisfying of the set, although Keaton had not yet here fully
  developed his mature style of humor. Here there is still a
  stylistic resemblance to the earlier association with Fatty
  Arbuckle. The backyard love affair, for example, that opens the
  film resembles Arbuckle's 1915 classic "Fatty's Plucky Pup". In
  Neighbors there is more story, revolving around the standard
  theme of feuding parents, and the eventual need for the couple to
  elope. There is sweetness, youthful energy, and innocence in the
  entire movie, as well as great acrobatics, including the
  innovative climactic escape involving two levels of men being
  carried on the shoulders of other men. The Balloonatic (1923),
  near the end of the period in which Buster was making short
  films, is less rich in comic ideas and lacks the energy and
  freshness of the earlier film. There is almost no slapstick but
  rather visual humor involving being trapped in a balloon and
  trying to survive in the wild and win an unwilling girl. Keaton
  loves using bodies of water and other objects of nature for
  comedic props, and this film is full of them. Still, for once
  Keaton seems uninspired, perhaps making this film to fulfill a
  contract requirement rather than for love of the story. The
  feature in the set, Seven Chances, from 1925, is based on a
  single theme: Buster, the rich boy down on his luck, must get
  married by the end of the day in order to inherit 7 million
  dollars. This absurd premise induces, for much of the film, a Hal
  Roach-like situation comedy rather than the visual, acrobatic
  style that is more associated with Keaton, as Buster is cornered
  into continuously proposing marriage to strangers. The variety of
  embarrassing rejections that Buster must endure has funny
  moments, but may not satisfy all of Buster's fans. The climax,
  however, returns us to tried and true Keaton formula: the lone
  man being chased by a thundering herd, in this case, of angry
  women in full wedding apparel, fed up at being duped by a
  newspaper ad submitted by Buster's colleague unbeknownst to
  Buster. The chase has satisfying moments, including Buster
  dodging large bolders. Although worth seeing, the reliance on the
  single absurd premise makes this film feel more like a dragged
  out short movie than a genuine feature. The result is a slightly
  less satisfying encounter with Keaton's genius.</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">In sanskrit, Ayurveda means the study of
  life. According to ancient Hindu texts, all healing systems stem
  from Ayurvedic medicine. This Ancient Ayurveda series dvd, led by
  Sarah Tomlinson with clarity and insight, provides a blueprint
  for increasing self-awareness through the use of asana, symbol
  and metaphor. Tomlinson, acts like a loving guide to going inward
  and discovering new self-truths. To effectively bring about
  change in our bodies and minds, we must change habitual patterns
  in the body. The poses in the series takes us through a full
  range of challenging movements, and Tomlinson illuminates the
  wisdom of this practice by brilliantly threading together how the
  poses evoke certain states of mind and spirit. Filmed against a
  simple, soothing background, Tomlinson wisely avoids distracting
  bells and whistles. Instead, the accompanying chanting by
  ayurveda master Gandharva,directly relates to the series in it's
  use of each of the planetary mantras. Tomlinson's has a great
  depth of knowledge about ayurveda, and she weaves many subtle
  suggestions and information about the benefits of each pose into
  the practice. This dvd is appropriate for beginner and advanced
  student: beginners will feel supported and encouraged, as well as
  exhilirated by the practice, and more experienced students will
  appreciate the multi-level aspect of Tomlinson's class. L.

  <Text category="dvd">This movie is intimate and special. Some
  reviews say it is the story of obsession, of fetishism, of
  trivial things. However, this movie is the story of something
  special in a young teenage boy's life: his fantasy woman. The
  character Malena rarely speaks throughout the movie, but we see
  her exactly how we are supposed to see her- through the eyes of
  an old man telling the story of himself in young "love". This
  perspective makes her ideal and special, with few flaws,as a
  fantasy woman is to a young man. Malena is instantly a likeable
  character, not awful and disgusting like those using her. We
  cannot forget that our narrator, Renato, is not actually a
  teenage boy but an older man telling his own story. Therefore, he
  is unreliable as a narrator. Malena's sins are washed clean
  through his judgement, and we believe him when we see her
  victimized by the other women. However, Renato has had years to
  think about everything, to contemplate what really happened to
  her. So, in the end, the people who use her are completely
  despicable, unable to garner any liking. Of course, she is a
  victim, but she eventually falls into the gossip that others
  believe she is guilty of with the men. The movie does offer a
  hint that she could have escaped all of the problems: she is from
  another city and her husband, for most of the movie, is dead.
  Yet, she chooses to not escape but to stay, and her fate is
  sealed. The music in the movie was nominated for Best Score in
  2000,and it is beautiful, emotional. It truly adds to the feeling
  of the movie. I would recommend this movie to anyone for the
  compelling story, emotion, and characters. You will never forget
  this movie.</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">I can't believe that no one else has
  reviewed this dvd. take advantage of the low price and BUY THIS
  NOW! i'm no expert on the HOT ROD scene, but this was very
  enjoyable. The footage of pinstripe artist SKRATCH is worth the
  price alone. I would say anyone who is into watching creative
  people do something artistic and original will really love this.
  you get to see the creative process of some great project cars,
  as well as getting into the motivation of some of the builders
  and car club members. I will definitely be watching this one a
  few times</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">I think that anyone who believes this movie
  to be "hilarious" or Hudson's performance "overrated" and
  "over-the-top" in her singing just doesn't like musicals. Or
  perhaps doesn't like an all black cast (I am not black) or is too
  young to understand the 60's world of music and payola and
  backstabbing. While touted to be similar to the experiences
  suffered by The Supremes with Diana Ross as its lead singer, it
  is close in some aspects and totally far away in others. The key
  words here are "loosely based" on the story of the Supremes. Why
  people, including Ross herself don't get that is beyond me! Over
  the top? If anyone saw the original play with Jennifer Holliday
  (I did see it) then you don't know the meaning of over the top.
  That character was supposed to be that way and Hudson did a
  wonderful job of that. Her performance overrated? Hogwash! She
  deserved all the accolades she received as a novice actress.
  Murphy did one of his best acting jobs ever! Beyonce's
  performance was good but not great. This was in part because her
  character while prominent was not the focus of the movie nor was
  it of the play. This was Beyonce's best acting performance thus
  far though she still needs some work and the "right" role. This
  was not the right role for her in my opinion. Hudson's character
  is the main and central character which puzzles me for the
  "supporting actress" win. Though as lead actress she probably
  would have lost. You people out there, don't take my word for
  this movie's greatness and take on a true part of history even if
  it was "white-washed," no pun intended. Or don't think its a bad
  movie like some other critics here. YOU MUST JUDGE FOR YOURSELF.
  I hope and think that you won't be disappointed. There are some
  more than subtle references to The Supremes and Diana Ross
  especially in some of the costumes, Beyonce's images and album
  covers (CD covers for you youngsters)BUT only die hard fans of
  the Supremes and people who were there at that time would know
  that. ENJOY</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">The sound quality and the quality of
  musicians is insanely good. I bought this primarily to see Jaco.
  The biggest distraction was the bits of James Dean and Doo Wap
  music videos from the 50's added in. I wish this was remastered
  with just the concert performances. Also, it appears to me that
  the Jaco Bass solo was cut. I still give it 5 stars
  regardless.</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">I had the distinct pleasure of seeing
  Richard Jeni live a few years ago and I gotta tell you that I
  really almost peed my pants. He was astoundingly funny. This DVD
  definitely captures his comic genius, although it is woefully
  short compared to the amazing talent that he is and that he
  expressed in the huge amount of material he developed. It was
  incredibly sad to see that he took his own life which, from what
  I heard, was based at least in part on the fact that he was not
  able to get the gigs he used to get, which is itself really sad.
  He developed what I think is the best comedy, which is comedy
  that stings and bites because it reveals us human beings as full
  of weaknesses that are, ultimately, pretty stupid in the face of
  everything good in this world. He will be sorely missed in this
  world that needs more people to show us all the dumb things we
  do...and by doing so, how we should and can be a lot better than
  we are</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">The Truth About Cats and Dogs is a
  thoroughly enjoyable, refreshing movie. Janeane Garofalo uses her
  bread and butter acting technique of playing a cynical,
  depressed, miserable, pessimistic character who sees herself as
  an ugly duckling who no man could want. Of course, she's not
  really acting. That's really her: lock, stock, and barrel. The
  miserable, pessimistic, vicious act isn't an act at all. The fly
  in the ointment to this movie is that Uma Thurman is not a
  knockout. Of course, some men would prefer the tall, thin blonde
  over the short brunette, but the basis of the movie hinges on Uma
  being the gorgeous woman and Janeane being average. But it
  doesn't work when you believe it's the other way around. Uma
  Thurman has certainly looked good in some movies, but she looks
  haggard here. Bottom Line: A good film about the "ugly duckling"
  getting the guy. Based on the classic Cyrano de Bergerac story,
  just like Roxanne starring Steve Martin</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">Oh! How I will never forget seeing the
  re-release of this film. It was in 1974 and I could not keep my
  eye's from it.It is now 2006 and I still can't.What this movie is
  to me is a place in my heart and being a avid collector of films
  from the silents to the classics and obscure I find that very
  meaningful.If you have not seen 7th you are missing out. It truly
  is a funtastic film.I put this above Jason and the argonauts for
  my reason alone(I KNOW I STAND ALONE IN THIS FOR JASON HAS MORE
  monsters and the great Ray Harryhausen has said JASON is his
  fav.along with many of his fans).What 7th has above Jason for me
  is MUSIC! A soundtrack to a film has always been a extra push to
  a film and the 7th voyage has that extra push on Jason.Bernard
  Herrman's score is so dreamlike you can close your eyes and leave
  7th on and the music is trancelike especially the snake woman
  dance.Please anyone who reads this have 7th voyage in your
  collection(Jason &amp;amp; the argonauts too for that matter).You
  wont be dissapointed I will always be grateful to have seen this
  on the big screen and never forget it,I hope when you watch Ray
  Harryhausen's children and Bernard Herrman's music come to life
  you too will not forget it.Some say Gone with the wind,Wizard of
  Oz Casablanca,Citizen Kane,Jaws, Star Wars(77), Superman(78) E.T.
  Titanic,2001 a space &amp;amp; Pulp Fiction.Not me! If I was on a
  island and could only have one film from my library (ouch!I have
  alot of films and alot I love)but I would have to pick The
  Seventh Voyage.That would be the one for me on the island.And
  please let it be the isle of colossus.</Text>

  <Text category="dvd">Richard Dreyfuss is excellent as a cop on a
  stakeout (along with partner Emilio Estevez) of pretty Madeleine
  Stowe (they have to watch her house through the night), and he
  falls in love with her. Before the movie is over there's a big
  car chase and an exciting climax in a lumber mill with a killer
  (Aidan Quinn). It's pretty standard fare for this kind of cop
  movie, but the script is above average - especially the dialogue
  - and Dreyfuss's performance is right on target. A very
  entertaining movie; definitely worth a watch</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">This movie was much better than "Vanilla
  Sky." "Vanilla Sky" mostly copied "Open Your Eyes" but was too
  obvious and less convincing. (And Tom Cruise, though good in some
  roles, didn't fit this role well.) "Open Your Eyes" takes a
  little longer to draw you in, but once it has you there it takes
  you far beyond where "Vanilla Sky" does. Also, the Jungian Dream
  aspect in "Vanilla Sky" is poorly done, whereas "Open Your Eyes"
  represents the dream experience very well. I recommend watching
  both movies before you buy one. But if you're going to buy, get
  "Open Your Eyes.</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">Excellent presentation and goes into detail,
  much of which may be unknown to the viewer. One minor criticism:

  with it is its too short only 4 episodes.</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">Robert Redford has proved us his undeniable
  artistic gifts in previous occasions, but with this giant movie
  he really achieved that coveted pearl; the state of art in all
  its wholeness. Redford crossed over the traditional concessions
  and he got to prove art and cinema should not be divorced: good
  taste and profitability may gather and shake hands, if you
  respect the sensibility and intelligence of the spectator. This
  picture not only broke the walls and not only became the most
  ambitious, artistic and perfect American film in the last quarter
  of Century; besides, the mature and sensitive script around an
  awful event that will transform the livings and expand the
  reduced frontiers of two different ways of life, enhancing them
  when the tragedy became an unexpected gate for the bliss.
  Redford' s artistic personality has a secure place in the
  immortality and I really hope for him to bring us future films
  filled of that enriched vision where the rude vulgarity, the
  visible special effects big circus and the simple anecdote not
  only be absent; and so the new directors to come, understand the
  true cinema meaning is ART. Thanks to his generous personal
  effort, for having created the Sundance Festival for new
  directors whose fruits will create new approaches and major
  visions. Special kudos to him due that clinical eye for a very
  young actress in progress at those years: Scarlet
  Johansson.</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">This was the first silent film that I saw in
  its entire form. The 1927 King Of Kings, directed by Cecil B.
  Demille. As with D.W Griffth, Charlie Chaplin, and Greta Garbo,
  he is right up their amoung silent icons. This movie, starring
  H.B. Warner as Jesus is a truely a jewel of a film. Everyone
  knows the story, but it is told very well here. Demille knew his
  bible films, like Ten Commandments(1924,1956) Samson And Delilah
  and this movie, The King Of Kings. The film maybe dated a tiny
  bit, but can the story of Jesus be dated. I love Jesus movies,
  like Jesus Of Nazareth, The Greatest Story Ever Told. The 1961
  King of Kings, and the musicals Jesus Christ Superstar and
  Godspell. And the story of Christ was also tackled in the 1916
  D.W Griffth classic Intolerence. But this film is broughhow much
  t out in much better detail. The special effects are amazing for
  1927, the crucifixion scene is astondishing,and a scene in color,
  which is the resurrection scene.The cast of characters is also
  amazing. In our era of movies, if you need a big scene, a will
  have only 100 people, and CGI the other tens of thousands. Since
  there was no CGI back in 1927, or computers for that matter, they
  directors like Demillie and Griffth had to actually get thousands
  of extras for there scenes in these epics. I know people think
  silents are boring but for an 18 year old, they are a gateway to
  the past. Without those groundbreaking films, no one would care
  about movies. Those early silents were the catalyst for what
  would become. I would recommend this film. This movie is a true
  classic, no matter what religion you are</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">My little boy who is 8 years old loves this
  movie. He goes around acting like the characters from the movie!
  He really likes Harold and keeps watching the movie over and over
  again hoping for a different ending. He is also convinced that
  they should make a Midnight Madness 2 and let Harold win the next
  time! This is a great movie, with a young Michael J. Fox in it,
  and has no sex or violence and is a very kid friendly
  movie</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">Instead of reviewing the content, my review
  is based more on the DVD Presentation. Pros: The Dolby Digital
  5.1 soundtrack is just excellent, with great separation of
  instrument up front and in back and the great use of surrounds
  for more that just audience cheering. Sound is only second to the
  Shakira Unplugged Dvd. Cons: Who ever mastered this DVD must be
  living in 1997. This concert was recorded in HD and is usually
  shown on MTV HD network. The big mistake being that the concert
  is not Anamorphic(Enhanced for 16x9 Televisions). Sure the
  majority will not care, but for those of you who own HD monitors,
  you will see the negative in losing that extra resolution and the
  fact that you have to manually zoom in. Second negative being
  that if you want to start the concert from a specific song, you
  have to start the concert from the beginning and skip ahead.
  Because if you try to start from the "Song Selection" menu, it
  will take you back to the menu every time the song you selected
  ends. Overall a great concert, but a disappointing DVD
  presentation</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">My wife really likes Martin. After listening
  to this concert I must say it is indeed a very good live
  presentation</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">I am not a horror movie fan, in fact there
  are very few horror movies that have truly scared me, but this
  one indeed made me literally crap myself. I caught this movie
  during the midnight hours on IFC 2 years ago, and luckily the
  movie was just starting, so I got to see it from beginning to
  end. This movie is basically about a man named Frank Zito (Joe
  Spinell) who's a psychotic serial killer who seeks pleasure by
  killing women, because he feels he's getting back at his abusive
  mother who was also a prostitute. After her death Frank feels
  alone, but cannot forget the mistreatment he received from her
  all those years. Frank lives in a tiny apartment in New York
  City, in which he keeps several mannequins. He uses these
  mannequins by putting his victim's bloody scalps, on it's heads.
  When he spots a woman named Anna (Caroline Munro), a photographer
  in the park taking pictures he gains a sudden interest in her,
  but not the type of interest in which he wants to murder her, but
  kind of a romantic interest. He takes her out to dinner and buys
  her gifts, but will he change his mind about her, and make her
  become another one of his victims? Some of the scenes in this
  film are so incredibly gut-wrenching, especially the scene when
  he chases a nurse into a subway station, and she hides in a
  bathroom stall. I felt my heart pounding the whole entire time.
  The effects were realistic (Nice Job Tom Savini!), they don't
  come close to todays, even though the movie was released in 1980.
  Joe Spinell plays this part so well that you might think he was
  for real, and not only that, but he physically looked the part
  too . The scenes where he's in his apartment talking to his
  mannequins are some of the most creepiest scenes I have ever seen
  in a movie. I believe that this film is one of the most realistic
  horror films out there, because we get to see the results of how
  an alone, mistreated child might turn out. This isn't one of
  those lame zombie movies, it's the real deal. If you like horror,
  and a lot of gore, and you haven't seen this then I recommend you
  watching this.</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">I was blown away by the wonderful acting of
  Juliet Lewis and Giovanni Ribisi who played the retarded young
  adults. This was a very compassionate film about the realities of
  living with a disability. Disabled people desire and deserve to
  have the same opportunities as everyone else. It was wonderful to
  see the love "Carla"'s siblings and parents had for her. There
  were 2 reasons I didn't give this movie 5 stars. One was that
  Diane Keaton's character of the overly controlling mother was
  annoying. Obviously she was supposed to be annoying, but I think
  she overacted a bit and she needed better lines, she seemed to
  say the same stuff over and over again. Another reason I didn't
  love this film was because Hollywood once again compels right
  wing nut jobs to write reviews that portray themselves as normal
  and good. Sorry, Hollywood, but there will always be those of us
  who still believe God's word to be true. Being a right wing nut
  job isn't considered normal or ok in the bible. God never created
  it. Look it up. You are not helping people who struggle with it
  to be set free from that addiction and lonely lifestyle.</Text>

  <Text category="dvd">I like this video for it's frankness and
  straight forward approach of a woman enjoying herself. Like yoga,
  it requires slowing down and noticing how your body feels while
  your watching it. The energy slowly rises and the woman increases
  it by playing with the tempo and rhythm of her touches. The
  quality of her session is unhurried and she is very relaxed and
  keeps her body still but her finger is moving in synchronicity
  with her orgasm. I found that in itself very interesting and
  different. It is refreshing to find a product that is different
  from the common depiction of women emulating ecstasy but one in
  which shows a woman actually really feeling what it feels like to
  create it in her body and show what it looks like. She shows a
  way of masturbating and stretching the sensation out that can
  really tweak your reality of how much pleasure a woman is capable
  of experiencing, a mind bender so to speak, and it challenges the
  cultural limitations of what orgasm is for a woman and how she
  experiences it</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">This is a good 1st season set for the series
  of Criminal Intent. I strongly recommend this if you are a
  fan</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">This DVD is a great complement to the DVD's
  offered by VCE(Trinity and Beyond, Nukes in Space, etc). By
  itself, it is a highly technical look at the process of testing
  materials, military equipment, and building materials during
  three atomic test series covered on the DVD set. The quality of
  the film varies between the three discs. The last Civil Defense
  video on Disc 2 suffers a lot of audio warble, unfortunately.
  But, it is nice to see these important historical documents
  preserved in a digital format. I've owned Trinity and Beyond for
  several years, and I really enjoy the way it is presented. But,
  it has to cover so many tests in a short amount of time that it
  skims over a lot of information about testing procedures, etc.
  You begin to get the impression that the military was doing these
  tests for their own amusement. After watching this DVD, I have a
  much better understanding of the entire process. It's easy to see
  why the military was eager to do so many tests in the early days
  of the atomic weapons program. The science of the atomic bomb was
  a moving target, and this DVD outlines the research they made.
  Though I would never like to see anyone use atomic weapons ever
  again, their sheer power is fascinating, beautiful, and
  frightening at the same time. If you are interested in the
  science of atomic testing, you should really take a look at this
  set</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">One only needs to watch Ball of Fire to
  realize the depth of Barbara Stanwyck's incredible talent. I'd
  match her up against ANY ACTRESS of her era or any other era!!
  Here is a woman who can rip your heart out...even when she plays
  unlikeable characters because she always lets you see
  multi-dimensions of her characters. Sugarpuss O'Shea is a perfect
  example of a bad girl with a soft heart who succumbs to the love
  a naive, good-looking gentleman. But she also shows her love to
  the other professors. 1941 was Stanwyck's greatest Movie
  Year.....she made "Meet John DOe" and "The Lady Eve" in this year
  as well and she is excellent in all of them. Stanwyck is the ONLY
  ACTRESS I CAN THINK OF who CAN DO ANYTHING!! From drama to
  comedy, to musicals and of course westerns!! While Stanwyck's
  singing is not on a par with her other talents (her singing was
  dubbed in Ball of Fire) she can still do a musical song and dance
  as is evidenced in her 1937 film (THIS IS MY AFFAIR where she
  plays a vaudeville entertainer). Bette Davis could never play
  comedy and was too mannered with her rapid fire clipped speech
  and overacting. SHe couldn't sing or dance (as Barbara did in
  Ball of FIre, Lady of Burlesque, This is My Affair and Banjo on
  My Knee). Katharine Hepburn was a good actress but very unnerving
  also with her mannerisms, high patrician attitude and SHE COULD
  NEVER PLAY A PART IN A MUSICAL. SHE COULDN'T SING). Joan Crawford
  was a good actress in good movies but very few of her movies are
  good and she couldn't sing. Doris Day was brilliant in comedy,
  musicals and drama but she would never be believable as a
  villainess or a heavy. The same with Judy Garland. Rare is the
  talent who could do it all. I dare anyone to disagree with me
  that Stanwyck was the ONE who could do it all....Drama, Comedy,
  Westerns, Musicals!! Heroine or villainess! Stanwyck's work is
  always FIRST CLASS even when applied to material that is not. She
  was simply the greatest and I'm sorry this review has turned into
  a tribute to Stanwyck but she should have won the Oscar in 1941
  for Ball of Fire when she proved that she was the greatest
  actress in that wonderful era of actresses!! The movie, Ball of
  Fire is great fun!! From beginning to end Stanwyck and Cooper are
  unbeatable!!! And the other professors are hilarious to watch as
  well!! There is also a marvelous musical score and the production
  values are top notch!</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">Just today I randomly selected a movie, that
  movie was "Henry". I had never heard of it before, and I figured
  that I was in for your average, run-of-the-mill low budget
  slasher flick. Though it is low budget, it is by no means your
  ordinary serial killer movie. In fact, the gritty film and
  minimalist effects only adds to the stark realism of this
  nightmarish character study. Meet Henry, a very quiet and serene
  man with vacant and staring eyes as well as a calm disposition.
  Watch as he goes to work, watch as he hits the bar with his buddy
  Otis, and watch as he calmly and systematically butchers random
  people. This film does not exploit the violence though; it is
  very frank and direct, treating it as though Henry were doing
  nothing more than cleaning the dishes or taking a stroll in the
  park. This movie is a lot of things, and when it was all over, I
  just had to sit back and take a few breaths, have a cigarette -
  and try to gauge my reaction(s). I was surprised to note that
  while this film is disturbing, it is also pretty funny in some
  parts, though only funny in the blackest sense of the term. There
  is no social commentary in this movie, nor does it provide any
  closure. The DVD is great, awesome extras including fragmented
  interviews with the genuine serial killer Henry Lee Lucas,
  awaiting lethal injection on death row. Very fascinating</Text>

  <Text category="dvd">I read the various reviews about the movie
  "The Hunter". I was surprised at the extremeties in preference.
  Much like owning a Fiero, . . . . which I do. The movie, as is
  the Fiero, is overall slower than most of McQueen's. However, he
  still pulls it off, showing his great acting ability. When you
  take the character, "Papa" Thorson, he was a different breed in
  the wrong time era. Who else, but McQueen could make him so
  realistic? I haven't seen the movie in several years. I have been
  wanting a copy to add to my library. I intend to do that today.
  Oh yeah, the relationship between the movie and the Fiero? I have
  found that there are those that either dearly love it or wish
  they had never laid eyes on it. I loved "The Hunter" and I love
  my Fiero. For those of you who don't understand, . . . "sorry"!
  Steve McQuen displayed more of his talent, even while ill. God

  <Text category="dvd">This was an excellent sophomore season for a
  great series</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">This is a thuroughly enjoyable movie; a
  pleasure to watch. THe acting, characters, and story are entirely
  plausible, and there is no grandstanding by primadonna actors,
  nor is there any of Hollywood's usual political preachiness
  (especially unusual considering Robert Redford's backing). THe
  only downside to the DVD is that it is full-screen, and not
  letterboxed. THe "bonus features" are somewhat lack-luster as
  well, and the menu system is laughable. Only one actor's credits
  have been updated since the movie was released, and the credits
  section is a token gesture at best. Still, this is one of those
  cases where it is cheaper to buy the movie than rent it
  twice</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">Long before the advent of the written word
  sacred knowledge was handed down through the generations via the
  vehicles of ritual, song and dance. I have come to believe that
  the 'old ways' were in many cases the superior mode of
  transmission. Mere words could never convey the multi-faceted
  beauty, wonder and awe that can be expressed in sacred song and
  dance. This point is made crystal clear in this exquisite
  production of 'Holo Mai Pele.' 'Holo Mai Pele' is an exciting and
  exotic multi-media production that I found absoultely engrossing.
  The director seamlessly moves the viewer back and forth between
  the preparation of the event in the dance studio, the on-stage
  performance and beautiful film footage of the enchanting Hawaiian
  landscape. The on-stage performance is also greatly enhanced by a
  large screen behind the dancers showing footage of volcanic
  eruptions, lava flows and lush tropical rainforests. All of this
  is underscored by an intermitent narrative explaining the history
  of the hula and the mythological tale of the volcano Goddess Pele
  and her battle with her youngest sister Hi'iaka. The narrative is
  the perfect compliment to the production and in no way detracts
  the viewer from the performance. This DVD serves as both a
  wonderful introduction to the novice in Hawaiiana and a much
  needed and revered document to the initiated providing a
  performance that attests to the power and immense beauty of the
  hula and its embodiment of the Hawaiian 'Spirit of Aloha.' Truly
  a sacred visual document to be treasured.</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">driller killer has, without question, the
  best director's commentary of any dvd i have ever seen. although
  driller killer is a far cry from his second film
  &amp;amp;quot;ms. 45&amp;amp;quot; it is a classic. reno can't
  seem to buy a thrill. despite the fact that he lives with two
  bombshells he can't get his painting finished to collect for the
  rent. his agent's reaction to his finished painting is absolutely
  priceless. what's worse is that his landlord has allowed a punk
  band to move in upstairs, adding insult to injury. the band, tony
  coca cola and the roosters, play &amp;amp;quot;the grand street
  stomp&amp;amp;quot; a guitar riff that has a great driving force.
  this film really documents the viallge punk circuit at the end of
  the 1970's. conventions are borrowed from polanski's
  &amp;amp;quot;repulsion&amp;amp;quot; and cassaveetes'
  &amp;amp;quot;shadows&amp;amp;quot;. the handheld mingling with
  the street people of the period shows how filthy NYC was at the
  time. Lots of fun. Driller Killer was meant to be listened to
  loud</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">Although many reviewers didn't like the
  second part of the "Hills", I still wouldn't call it "one of the
  worst sequels ever" or "the worst Wes Craven film". Certainly
  this is not a masterpiece, even in the framework of horror genre,
  but I don't see why it should be worse than any other slasher
  flick. When I was watching it, I came to a conclusion early Wes
  Craven had been imitating other directors rather often. I'm not
  saying he was not original at all - eventually he shot "A
  Nightmare on Elm Street" in 1984. But "The Hills Have Eyes" were
  reminiscent of "Texas Chainsaw Massacre", and in the beginning of
  80s, when slasher era started, I guess Craven decided to make
  something in the same manner. Maybe the reason was Craven's
  long-time buddy Sean Cunningham created "Friday the 13th" in
  1980, and Wes was envious? :) Anyway the second part of "The
  Hills Have Eyes" turned out to be a pure slasher like many others
  at that time. And it obviously wasn't the worst and in many ways
  was like above mentioned "Friday the 13th": the score was written
  by Harry Manfredini, known to every "Friday" fan, and the music
  in "Hills 2" is just like in early "Fridays". The body count
  increased comparing to the first part and approached a regular
  slasher movie. Kevin Blair who had a leading male part here,
  would star in "Friday the 13th part VII" a couple of years later
  along with Kane Hodder, who did stunts for "The Hills Have Eyes
  2" and in "Friday" would play you know whom. Of course here we
  can see some stupidities as in other slasher movies (like
  characters wandering in night all alone instead of sticking
  together, all the big strong guys get killed, and a handicapped
  girl survives - I'm not even considering it as a spoiler for it
  is obvious from the very beginning, especially if you've seen a
  couple of horror films in your life), but is that a problem for a
  true horror fan? We've learned not to take this trivia into
  account. So I think "The Hills Have Eyes 2" managed on many
  levels, and it would be interesting to have it in your
  collection, if you have the first one. For they are two totally
  different films talking about the subgenres of horror.</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">We must thank the director and salute
  Sigourney Weaver's beautiful performance: this movie gives us a
  rare insight into the lives and minds of the gentle, yet
  ferocious, giant mountains gorillas. It is also the amazing
  journey of an extroardinary woman who went to live by herself in
  a remote mountain of Rwanda, secluded from the world. She lost
  much of her sanity, as well as her life, in the process of saving
  the lives of a few hundred remaining gorillas. Without her work,
  who knows who could have saved them from savage murder and total
  extinction? Thanks to her work and dedication, a "lost cause" had
  been heard at last. The struggle for the survival of the "Great
  Apes" is not totally over though. One must hope that the abject
  poverty and the political unrest that still affect the region, as
  well as the illegal poaching and smuggling of goods and animals
  across borders - that happen with or without government
  officials' approval in each country involved - and the continuing
  deforestation and fauna's loss of habitat, can one day all come
  to an end so that the survival of these amazing creatures can be
  achieved. One must recognize the sacrifices and thank people like
  Diane Fossey, conservationists around the world, and the Rwandese
  people in particular, who have made it possible so far despite
  great internal economic and political pressures. All hope is not
  lost!</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">I loved the artistic topics of Art &amp;amp;
  Music in this particular Little People DVD. And I have to say,
  this is one of our favorites. But I do agree with the other
  reviewer about the duplicate episodes showing up in each DVD. If
  you have other LP movies, then you will feel slightly
  dissapointed to see the episodes repeating themselves here and
  there. I also agree that the menu setup could be better, with all
  10 episodes playing back-to-back, rather than split into 5 at a
  time the way they currently are. Otherwise, this is still a great
  DVD - much better than the LP Storytime Collection</Text>

  <Text category="dvd">What is it with the British film scene and
  its distinctly gritty style. It seems that if we're not producing
  trashy Ealing comedies, it's a shocking reality drama with the
  likes of Ray Winstone in it? Well Ray Winstone isn't in this one,
  but he could well be as the Rat Catcher is another one of those
  'you either enjoy challenging films or you don't' pieces. I
  personally love them, I guess I must be a miserable bugger! Of
  course this film investigates the reality of the underclass,
  dysfunctional life lived in a rough and grimey housing estate.
  But it is unique (well probably not unique) in that it is told
  pretty much entirely from the view of the 12 year old boy, played
  by William Eadie, who is struggling to make some sense of what is
  going on around him. We learn that no matter what environment
  children grow up in, they always seem to hold true and remain
  untainted somehow. Without wishing to give too much away, it is
  the final brief scene of this film which has stayed in my mind
  ever since I watched it in 2000. Worth the wait if you like being
  deeply moved by simple things</Text>

  <Text category="dvd">AFI finally release a live DVD, and as a
  portrayal of the band as it stands now, it is very impressive. It
  does lack older, more hardcore punk tracks, but that is to be
  expected as the band grows and matures into the band it is now.
  Each album progresses towards more epic scales, and songs balance
  beauty with power. "I Heard a Voice" captures this on film, and
  the fan gets to witness AFI at their most grandiose. Watching
  vocalist Davey Havok sing "God Called in Sick Today" while being
  held up by the audience is amazing to watch and gives this
  reviewer chills everytime. The masterful command of theatrics
  from each member, especially Havok, creates a powerful feeling
  unable to fully describe but easy to appreciate. The setlist
  itself is perfectly put together, with the only gripe being the
  exclusion of "Kiss and Control." The rest of the songs display
  all facets of AFI, from the fast paced "Dancing Through
  Sunday",(which includes a nicely executed guitar solo by
  guitarist Jade Puget) "Kill Caustic", "Death of Seasons",
  "Totalimmortal" and "A Single Second", (the last of which
  features a guest appearance by Nick 13 of Tiger Army) to the
  slower paced "This Time Imperfect" and "Endlessly, She Said" as
  well as all of their recent singles, and a few more cuts from
  their latest releases "Decemberunderground" and "Sing the
  Sorrow". Extras are geared towards the fans, with Despair Faction
  interviews and the inclusion of videos from their massive
  scavenger hunt prior to the Decemberunderground release, as well
  as a poster. Each band member has their moments to shine, and are
  all very capable and talented muscians. Bassist Hunter Burgan and
  drummer Adam Carson lay down a solid foundation as well as
  background vocals, as Puget layers his unique guitar sound and
  obvious mastery, in this genre, over the instrument. This is all
  built up to allow Havok to use his unique vocal approach to
  wander in between melodies and notes, mixing powerful singing
  with a fantastic screaming voice, to create beautiful atmospheres
  of sound that can crash down on you just as easily as it
  hypnotizes you. The quality of the sound production as well as
  the video edits are fantastic. Unlike other live DVD's, where the
  concert is edited to the point of a music video, "I Heard a
  Voice" has just the right amount to not make you forget you are
  watching a live dvd, but also add to the overall effect of the
  performance. The sound is very clear, and the sound levels are
  perfectly set to allow each member to cut through the mix. This
  is overall a very stellar production, and fans who have already
  embraced the new direction of the band, as well as new fans and
  casual fans, should find the dvd to be quite entertaining and a
  very worthwhile buy</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">I'm pretty new to the Yoga experience. I
  started with a Kathy Smith DVD (hated it!) then I got a Yoga Zone
  Video -- the one for flexibility and toning and I found it to be
  very good. I then got another video -- Yoga Shakti which is
  excellent too and I was looking for another beginner video (the
  Yoga Shakti one has some advanced parts in it) so I bought Yoga
  Zone -- Introduction to Yoga. While some of the moves in it are
  on my first video, I still found this to be very good for
  beginners. Alan again teaches you the breathing technique --
  which I often forget. I noticed on another review someone
  complained about the slowness of it. Yes, it does move slow
  HOWEVER if you're a beginner and you're just learning the poses,
  the last thing you would want is for it to move fast. He takes
  the time to explain each pose and how it should feel when you're
  doing it. His voice is very soothing and puts me in a calm frame
  of mind. I honestly have to say that if I did NOT originally buy
  a yoga zone dvd, I more than likely would not have pursued the
  practice. I think that Yoga Zone is what has gotten me more into
  it and wanting to practice more and learn more. I highly suggest
  this dvd to any beginner yoga-lite out there</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">"Backbeat" is an excellent portrayal of the
  Hamburg phase of the early Beatles, and succeeds on every level.
  Although purportedly intended primarily to tell the story of
  "fifth Beatle" Stuart Sutcliffe, the focus quickly shifts to John
  Lennon who (as in real life) dominated the music and lives of the
  early Beatles. It is as much the story of Stu and John as the
  story of Stu and Astrid, and explores the dynamics of both
  complex relationships. Still, it is a fascinating look at the
  early Beatles, who paid their dues by playing in some of the
  rough Reeperbahn bars in the pre-fame years. The cast is
  excellent, and were obviously chosen for their talent rather than
  their resemblance to the characters they portrayed. The music is
  also excellent, and complements the story perfectly. In all,
  "Backbeat" is an entertaining journey through the world of the
  early Beatles, and is well worth purchasing for repeat
  viewings.</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">Good subject, the workings of a devious
  female mind. A complicated love triangle. Superb acting</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">David Cromemberg did an excellent job with
  the adaptation of Stephen King's novel, and Christopher Walken
  was superb in his portrayal of Johnny Smith (no middle initial).
  The supporting cast added to the film: Martin Sheen was a
  convincing Greg Stilson (was this a warm up for his West Wing
  role?), I'm a big fan of Tom Skerritt, and I didn't recognize
  Herbert Lom from his Pink Panther role. This movie (and the book)
  are put in the horror genre, but I would consider the story to be
  true science fiction. Smith's character was in a coma for several
  years, and the story's premise is that this coma enabled his
  brain to tap into psychic ablilities. There is nothing
  supernatural about the villains; they're just normal bad people.
  This movie is not completely faithful to the movie. Some of the
  changes are to make it fit a moderately lengthed movie (104
  minutes) instead of a 400+ page novel. Some of the changes add
  moderate suspense, keeping the interest of someone who read the
  novel first. I do question the need for some of the changes -- I
  don't know why Johnny Smith's psychic abilities required personal
  contact in the movie (he could learn things touching people's
  clothes or a geographic spot in the book), and I didn't think it
  was necessary of having his tutoree be a younger boy in the movie
  instead of a teenager as in the book (this made for what I
  considered weaker parts of the movie). True science fiction is
  effective because it takes a normal person, puts them in an
  abnormal situation, and thus investigates the person's character.
  Due to the time constraints of the movie, it did not as
  effectively deal with the wrestlings of conscience Smith had, but
  they were not absent either. As a result, the story (both book
  and movie) have a feel of a classic tragedy. This movie is not
  for children, though it could have easily gained a PG rating
  (this movie came out the year before PG-13 was introduced). The R
  rating was gained by one usage of the F-word, a couple of seconds
  of a revealed breast, and a short gruesome scene involving the
  death of a character. (Cromemberg has a reputation for
  gruesomeness in his other movies, like "Scanners", "Videodrome",
  and the 1986 remake of "The Fly"; this movie had him more
  subdued, but very effective.) Besides the R-rating, there are
  aspects of the story (equally true in the novel as in the movie)
  that I find disturbing as a fundamentalist minister. This is
  because of its dependence on situation ethics. Adultery and
  murder are considered acceptable on the part of Johnny Smith
  because of the situations. In spite of these misgivings, I think
  this was an excellent movie. I think it was worthy of several
  awards, such as acting nominations for Walken and Sheen, for
  adapted screenplay, and for best picture.</Text>

  <Text category="dvd">The Hand of Fear is not top-notch, all-time
  classic Who. Even producer Philip Hinchcliffe doesn't like it
  very much. The only reason it was likely selected for DVD release
  over such classics as The Seeds of Doom or Terror of the Autons
  is probably because it's Sarah Jane's farewell story. Many
  stories during the Hinchcliffe/Holmes years of Who, sometimes
  referred to as the "golden age" of Doctor Who, sometimes referred
  as the "gothic horror period," were based on movies. The Seeds of
  Doom was based on The Day of the Triffids. Horror of Fang Rock
  was based on And Then There Were None. If not based on an actual
  film, many were "inspired" in general by the look and feel of the
  Hammer horror films. The Hand of Fear was inspired by The Hands
  of Dr. Orlac, the old horror film about the disembodied hand of a
  killer. The story starts out great, beginning with a fantastic
  in-joke. Rock quarries were VERY frequently used in the program
  as they were easily accessible and somewhat looked like alien
  planets. Here the Doctor and Sarah land in a rock quarry on
  earth, and Sarah thinks they're on an alien planet! After an
  accident with a detonation, Sarah finds Eldrad's hand, and starts
  saying she/he/it must live a lot. "Eldrad must! live" (high note
  on "must"). She takes the hand to a nuclear power plant where it
  can start absorbing energy and regenerating. The story thus far
  is excellent, and Sarah Jane, possessed by Eldrad, is genuinely
  creepy, though why she's dressed as Andy Pandy I'll never know.
  Extremely effective is the scene were the power plant worker
  disappears with the hand into the core. Also extremely effective
  is Eldrad eerily searing through the metal door of the power
  plant's core, and then slowly emerging. The show goes downhill
  quick once Eldrad, Doctor and co. head to Eldrad's planet.
  Producer Hinchcliffe said this was a bad shift and that it lacked
  a certain punch. I agree. For some reason, once Eldrad is back on
  its home planet the story loses all its edge. Furthermore,
  Sarah's farewell seems entirely forced. The Hand of Fear,
  overall, is still good stuff though, and is well worth owning. It
  is one of the few episodes that contains the cool version of the
  Tardis interior. (Why they didn't stick with the awesome Jules
  Verne-ish interior I have no idea!)</Text>

  regurgitation of giblets scene from 'city' i was shocked.When i
  watched the nipple scene in 'ripper' i was shocked.Watching this

  definetely not his goriest and the story isnt really the
  greatest(im sorry).The only reason i write this review is

  described by a great artist who treasures their common humanity,
  in "The Bridge on the River Kwai" they are forced to carry out
  their destinies by an officer who cannot bear to see his bridge
  blown up... Escape is almost impossible from the Japanese camp
  located near the Kwai River in Burma... The prisoners are badly
  treated by cruel guards... The camp commander is a rigid
  psychopath... Conditions are hard to bear... Psychological state
  of the war British prisoners in constant alteration... Into the
  presumptuous situation comes Colonel Nicholson (Alec Guinness in
  a fascinating performance), a strict, serene, dedicated British
  Officer, deeply concerned for the welfare of his men... Nicholson
  is under severe pressure from the stubborn Japanese Colonel Saito
  (Sessue Hayakawa) for insisting on his attachment to the Geneva
  convention and refusing to allow his officers to be used on the
  construction of the strategic bridge... Nichilson survives the
  oppressive punishment imposed on him, but his obsession has risen
  to near-madness... He agrees to help the Japanese build their
  bridge, and in his determination to find victory in defeat, he
  ignores that the bridge, which he insists must be a 'proper
  bridge,' will serve the Japanese objectives against the British
  troops... In addition to the powerful rules of a prison camp
  picture, captors against captives and an interesting moral
  respect to a military code, a third element, in the story, is
  introduced: a small commando team led by Major Warden (Jack
  Hawkins) and an American sailor (William Holden) whose mission is
  to destroy the strategic bridge.. The film leads swiftly to a
  suspenseful climax: a Japanese train and a Commando force
  directed to a same goal, the Brige of the River Kwai... Each
  character, in the motion picture, has a valid reason for what he
  is doing, and each elaborates a relationship to the bridge
  revealed to be obsession and insane... "The Bridge on the River
  Kwai" hits with 'war' in a compelling logic of events, the
  indulgence of self-destruction. With a great visual beauty and
  terrific whistling tune March, "The Bridge on the River Kwai" is
  a great dramatic entertainment of the wills of men...</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">This is the definitive lesbian love story
  that launched the genre in a new direction. Out of the dirty bars
  and masculine flannel shirts, away from the creepy angst of
  punks. This wonderful love story brings lesbian love into the
  light of day with beautiful women, looking and acting sexy, and
  leading productive, respectable lives. WHY NOT portray lesbians
  as beautiful, educated, clean, classy, talented, sober,
  drug-free, non-violent, non-"self-destructive", straight forward,
  honest...oh, and truly SEXY?? The Reno landscape in the 50's is a
  great backdrop for the conflicts that lesbians encountered. The
  filming is top notch, the sets and period clothing are spot on.
  The musical scores are superb! The cast was wonderful!
  Charbonneau and Shavers are sensational as total opposites who
  eventually become drawn and attrated to each other. Just a
  masterful duette of performances! Cay, free and fully out,
  forward and knowing just what she wants; Vivian, tentative and
  reluctant to step outside of her cultured and closed box. Every
  minute they spend with each other oozes electricity and sexual
  tension. Two georgeous women making love?? HELLO! The love scene
  is landmark. Audra Lindley is wonderful and perfectly cast as

  in any collection. Timeless tale of the beauty of lesbian
  love.</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">I would argue that since we really haven't
  evolved all that far since our primate days human males still
  have loads of aggression and animalistic behavior they need to
  get out. And despite the best efforts from civilization in
  general to neuter them that aggression still has to go someplace.
  In Mary Harron's "American Psycho" it comes out in all the wrong
  places. The film is a character study of one Patrick Bateman
  (Christian Bale), a Wall Street yuppie by day and an ax murderer
  by night. Patrick is a man who has been forced to the edge
  because of the fakeness that surrounds him. It's not just the
  suits and the empty conversations either. It is the peeing
  contests over who has the best haircut or apartment or business
  card. He tries to talk about his problems, he really does, but
  nobody listens to him because nobody listens period. To their
  ears "Murders and Executions" is interchangeable with "Mergers
  and Acquisitions." The film is a big punch in the face to the
  egotistical businessmen of the 1980's. This particular Gordon
  Gekko is overdone and overacted by Christian Bale in a great
  performance. He is robotic, phony, arrogant and absurd. He is the
  kind of guy who will have a 3 some with prostitutes just so that
  he can admire himself in the mirror doing so (all the while
  flexing his biceps). More than anything he is militantly
  materialistic. He is Dexter mixed with Jim Profit, only he likes
  to style and profile while taking an ax to a co-workers head. The
  whole point, which is made clear in the final scene, is that
  while these people may truly believe that only the glossy veneer
  matters it is really the inside that counts. Just because these
  people make enough cash to swim in, Scrooge McDuck style, doesn't
  mean that their behavior is excusable. Harron paints the modern
  businessman as an American Psycho, and it is all too fitting. To
  make it in the business world your conscious and your soul must
  be turned off, you must be turned into Patrick Bateman. The film
  is a great success. As a horror movie villain Patrick has one of
  the most compelling backstories ever. Every scene has great
  energy to it and even though Bale looks a little out of place his
  acting is so good you can't stop watching him. There is something
  of a conflict presented when Willem Dafoe shows up to play a
  detective on the case of one of Patrick's murders. That storyline
  is interesting while it lasts, but it is never quite wrapped up.
  I would also admit that after awhile I got a little sick of
  swimming in these debaucherous waters. He may never tire of
  having it dirty and bloody but I eventually did. The character is
  endlessly fascinating (what is up with his love of cheesy 80's
  music?) and the scene where he kills Paul Allen will leave you
  stunned and hypnotized. The male need for aggression isn't going
  anyplace and we need to find a good way to channel it. .
  .otherwise we are going to have a lot more Patrick Bateman's and
  Iraq Wars on our hands. ***3/</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">From 1997 to 2003, Joss Whedon gave his
  audience some of the best episodes aired on television. BUFFY THE
  VAMPIRE SLAYER showcased an empowered young girl saddled with the
  unintimidating name of Buffy Summers, who, with the help of her
  high school friends and her stuffy mentor Giles, faced sundry
  monsters and saved the world - a lot. Along the way, she managed
  to leave an indelible impact on our pop cultural consciousness.
  Before its series debut, Buffy the Vampire Slayer, based on its
  promotional push on TV, seemed slated to be a straight-out horror
  series starring an erstwhile typical high schooler who battles
  vampires and demons. But, fairly quickly on, this unassuming
  little show, thanks to Whedon's intense and witty, pop-culture
  savvy yet very literate writing, met and surpassed the viewer's
  expectations. Whedon created compelling stories and characters
  who grew on the viewers; for seven years, we watched them strive
  to maintain a normal life as they navigated thru high school,
  college life, and then to adulthood, all the while frequently
  facing down supernatural threats. Which brings us to Season 7.
  Possible SPOILERS follow: Here in the bittersweet and melancholy
  finale season, Joss Whedon attempts to provide closure to the
  show and also to bring it full circle to its origins. The opening
  episode "Lessons" has Buffy escorting Dawn, for her inaugural
  school day, back to good, ol' Sunnydale High, which has just been
  rebuilt on top of the old one. This, by the way, means that the
  Hellmouth is very much alive and again active. Somehow, Buffy is
  offered a job as a school counselor at Sunnydale High by the
  enigmatic principal, Robin Wood (24's D.B. Woodside). Back in
  England, Willow, under the tutelage of Giles and a benevolent
  coven of witches, has been recovering from her turn to the dark
  side (Season Six) and receives a horrifying glimpse of the future
  for Sunnydale. Meanwhile, Spike is found dwelling in the
  Sunnydale High School basement in a bonkers state of mind,
  influenced by his new soul and possibly also by...something else.
  Lessee, who's left? Anya is again a Vengeance Demon, though her
  heart isn't really in it. And Xander is still fixing windows...
  The season's major story arc involves the return of the First
  Evil, the original and the source of all evil. The First's return
  is made possible by the instability caused by Buffy's having died
  and consequently being resurrected (again, Season 6). Very early
  on, we get a hint of the season's Big Bad as various Sunnydale
  denizens spout the ominous warning: "From beneath you, it
  devours." This season also increases the scope of Buffy's world
  even more as most of the Watcher Council are annihilated and
  Giles is forced to seek out Potential Slayers (who are also being
  killed off one by one by Bringers, no-eyed, murdering servants of
  Caleb and the First) and bring them to Sunnydale for protection.
  Now, more than ever, Buffy's leadership skills and methods are
  tested and even questioned as several of the Potentials prove to
  be uncowed and contentious free thinkers. Buffy has never been
  forced to deliver as many bracing, rallying speeches as she has
  been this season, which attests to her foe's overwhelming level
  of menace. Because the First cannot enter our world in a
  corporeal form and can only assume the identities of dead people,
  this is an opportunity for a callback of Buffy's past uber-foes.
  For one last time, we get to enjoy cameos of the Master,
  Drusilla, the Mayor, Adam, Glory, and two of the Nerd Trio.
  Pretty neat. Besides the First, Buffy faces two despicable and
  truly hard-to-kill villains, who are themselves minions of the
  First: the Turok-Han, an early caveman type of vampire (thus,
  even more sturdy than contemporary vampires) and Caleb, the
  frightening, mysoginistic preacher who convincingly beats Buffy
  senseless in several encounters. As ever, the writers do an
  amazing job. The episodes are obviously action-packed. But,
  underneath the surface, the show is laden with metaphors and
  symbolisms. Themes of isolation, the isolation of a leader,
  female empowerment, sacrifice, friendship, and humanity are
  touched on in great depth. This season is also about the quest
  for redemption. Most of the members of Buffy's Scooby gang,
  ironically, at one point or another, were evil or have turned
  evil in the past: Willow, Spike, Anya, Faith, Andrew...All these
  characters are trying to find their way back to atonement; it
  won't be easy. This season has to be the one with the most
  recurring characters in it. Principal Wood and the Potentials are
  introduced. Season 7 also marks the return of Andrew, Faith, and,
  in one episode, Angel. With the glut of additional characters,
  the core Scoobies are given short thrift here, although Dawn does
  shine in "Potential" and Xander proves his worth in "Potential"
  and "Dirty Girls." One episode, "Selfless," really focuses on
  Anya and paves the way for her eventual return to the fold. Only
  Spike seems to maintain copious screen time throughout the
  series. The camera, of course, is ever on Buffy Summers. The
  arrival of the Potentials does usher in a freshness to the series
  as it simultaneously takes the spotlight away from the Scoobies.
  The take-charge Kennedy (Iyari Limon), the feisty Rona (Indigo),
  and Amanda (Sarah Hagan) prove to be welcome additions to the
  cast, while the non-English speaking Asian Potential drops some
  instant funnies. "Conversations with Dead People" reintroduces
  Andrew (the very good, very funny Tom Lenk) as a possible good
  guy, while "Dirty Girls" marks the welcome return of sexy Faith
  (Eliza Dushku) as her encounters with Spike provide some of the
  high points of the season. The awesome Nathan Fillion, by the
  way, is scary good as Caleb. The Special Features provide episode
  commentaries by various cast and crew members on "Lessons,"
  "Selfless," "Conversations with Dead People," "The Killer In Me,"
  "Lies My Parents Told Me," "Dirty Girls," and "Chosen." Disc 3
  has the featurette "It's Always Been About the Fans." Disc 6
  offers up four more featurettes (the 36-minute long "Season 7
  Overview - Buffy: Full Circle"; "Buffy 101- Studying the Slayer"
  - various television critics talk about the show's influence;
  "Generation S" - interviews with the Potentials actresses; "The
  Last Sundown" - a look at Joss Whedon's top 10 favorite Buffy
  episodes and some of his thoughts about the series); an outtakes
  reel (not that funny); "Buffy Wraps" (the wrap party with cast
  and crew, but where was Sarah Michelle Gellar?); and for those
  who care, a DVD-ROM Willow Demon Guide. Years ago, Joss Whedon
  wanted to shake things up by turning topsy-turvy the cliche of
  the hapless, little blonde damsel needing a hero to come to her
  rescue. Seven years of quality television has proven that
  audiences will accept a tiny girl being capable of slaying
  monsters while remaining quintessentially feminine. So, above all
  else, BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER is meant to be a feminist
  allegory. But, for those who aren't into that, there's still so
  much that this season has to offer: an us against the world
  mentality, superlative action sequences, shivery horror/fantasy
  elements, witty repartees, heartfelt dialogue, gripping, dramatic
  stories, and great acting. And, of course, great, iconic heroes
  in Buffy Summers, Spike, Faith, and crew. Five stars for one of
  my all-time favorite shows EVER. Oh, yeah, and I like the slim
  set collection.</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">First let me start off by saying this. Ken
  Sushi Volume 1 is unquestionably the BEST video guide for making
  sushi. I have had a chance to see the other guides, and quite
  frankly they just don't cut it. Poor camera work, and even worse
  instruction should not be found in a sushi instructional video
  (or any culinary instructional video for that matter). Also,
  being taught by a sushi enthusiast rather than a professional
  sushi chef is not going to send a very good message to people who
  are really serious about learning how to make sushi properly
  (people want to learn from someone experienced, not
  enthusiastic). Finally we have a video that is taught by a
  professional in the sushi scene, and he really takes the time to
  lay out all the techniques he's developed over the years, so that
  with a little practice (and the benefit of not having to take the
  time Ken did to trial and error his methods of perfect sushi
  creation) I was actually able to make some really great sushi.
  The camera work is GREAT! No shakes or stutters, I didn't find
  myself distracted by the nuances of poor production quality.
  Truthfully this video is done so well, you will just find
  yourself immersed in what Ken is teaching (it plays a LOT like a
  chef Martin Yan instructional video). Also it seems a lot of time
  was taken in pre production to really focus the instruction to a
  degree that it is thorough enough for someone familiar with sushi
  creation, yet developed enough so that someone completely new to
  the sushi experience can actually have a fair shot to making a
  wholesome, delicious dish. If you take the time to watch the
  video a few times, and practice along with it. You WILL make
  sushi good enough to eat, and present to your friends, family
  (just utterly show off). I'm just really glad I can finally say
  there is now a sushi instructional video that I feel was worth
  every penny of my purchase. If you want to really learn how to
  make sushi well, then Ken Sushi Volume 1 will be your number one
  resource. The only negative thing I have to say is where the heck
  is volume two????</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">I SHOWED THIS MOVIE TO MY STUDENTS. THEY HAD
  RED THE BOOK AND THIS WAS REENFORCEMENT FORE THE LESSON. THEY
  REALLY ENJOYED IT</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">This live DVD was released as a companion to
  Randy Travis' "Worship &amp;amp; Faith" CD. The concert was
  recorded on July 15, 2003 at Calvary Assmebly God Church in
  Orlando, Florida. Here, Travis delivers many of the songs from
  the W&amp;amp;F album, plus "Pray for the Fish" and his country
  radio hit "Three Wooden Crosses." Comments from Travis and from
  several fans are added in between songs. Like its audio
  companion, this DVD contains a great mix of classic hymns, camp
  meeting songs and contemporary worship songs. Some of the
  highlights include "You Are Worthy of My Praise," "Just a Closer
  Walk with Thee," "We Fall Down" and "Open the Eyes of My Heart."
  Other noteworthy tracks include "Shall We Gather at the River,"
  "Peace in the Valley," "Above All" and "Love Lifted Me." Travis
  closes the show with "Three Wooden Crosses," the first song
  recorded on a Christian music label to ever top the country music
  charts. "Worship &amp;amp; Faith" is a great DVD for lovers of
  worship music, lovers of country music, as well as for any and
  every Randy Travis fan. This is an excellent DVD</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">I became a Robson Green fan when I saw the
  first season of Wire in the Blood. Since then, I have read the
  books, and watched Green in his other crime series, Touching
  Evil. If you like to watch films about police solving serial
  killer crimes, you will enjoy this. The crimes are shocking, the
  denouement is interesting, and at the heart of the story is the
  developing relationship between Dr. Tony Hill (Green) and the
  police woman with whom he works these crimes</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">DO NOT PASS THIS ONE UP. BUY THIS AMAZING
  DVD AND YOUR EARS WILL BE SATISFIED..</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">Much of the plot has been outlined above, as
  well as the cast and I am, in large part, in complete agreement
  with the positive reveiws recorded. I want to add that, for
  anyone raised on the old Universal horror pictures, or the films
  directed by James Whale or Val Lewton, where the suspense is the
  important part of the film; this picture, Shadows and Fog, has
  this quality absolutely dripping from every frame! Despite the
  comedic elements (and there are many funny things happening) the
  tension rises perceptibly throughout the narrative. The climax is
  dissapointing for many, but if you follow the subtext of this
  extremely philosophical script it is nearly a perfect resolution
  in all ways. I have had philosophy students who were struggling
  with concepts of 19th and 20th century writers watch this movie
  and instantly gain insight into the point of the often times
  obtuse &amp;amp; oblique writings of Hegel, Kant and the like. I
  beleive that the unpopularity of the this film is based on people
  thinking that they were about to see Bananas or Sleeper. Love him
  or hate him, you have to admit, Woody Allen is DEEP. A personal
  favorite film of mine, but definetly not everybodies cup of
  philosophicallly comedic tea</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">This is the all time, great, original
  classic. The remake is .......ok at best. Add this to your
  classic movie collection. Highly recommended</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">I don't usually like these type of movies,
  but this is a can't miss...you'll laugh</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">This dvd'd ok. It has the original program
  in it, and some new features. Although I was a bit dissapointed
  as the new features, only included about 10 mins of extra buzzer
  beaters, and the T.Mac ending goes for like 5 mins, and the
  quality isnt that great</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">This DVD is great, heck, it has the Nickel
  on the cover! Anyways, this DVD has a bonus feature of Mac's
  amazing three point flurry vs. San Antonio earlier this season -
  in its entirety, they used the TNT broadcast. A must have just
  for that alone! It also has Franchise's game winner during
  opening night, Fisher's 0.4 shot, Wade's heroics, and of course
  the classic endings, like Rik Smit's buzzer beater vs. the Magic
  in 1995, Larry Bird's game-winners, and can't forget about the
  best one of them all, MJ's final shot in 1998. Another bonus
  feature is all of the recent buzzer beaters from Horry, Carter,
  Iverson, and Marbury</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">I received this in a speedy manner. And it
  was in great condition. I would buy from this person again</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">This is a terrific tour of Hawaii. The
  photography is incredible and it shows Hawaii's breathtaking
  scenery including beautiful beaches on Oahu and Maui, Mt.
  Haleakala and Waimea Canyon. The music's great and the narration
  includes lots of travel tips as you're completely immersed in a
  Hawaiian vacation - volcanoes, exciting nightlife, surfing, scuba
  dives and hulas that "were so alluring that the missionaries
  banned them". The only person who would not like this DVD simply
  doesn't want to unwind and relax during this fascinating travel
  guide. After you see this you'll want to explore this paradise
  yourself and this DVD will help you plan your trip or your
  honeymoon</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">Like many that have seen this movie, I have
  been a fan of the video game series for years, and this movie
  never disappoints me. It has everything that makes RE great;
  strong characters, interesting story and scenes that make me
  jump. At first, it is sad that no video game characters make it
  on to this movie, but Milla Jovovich is great as the heroine
  Alice. The special effects were really good for this movie. The
  licker and the dogs were really impressive. The action is also
  very entertaining. When the action is happening, I find myself
  not being able to turn away, it is very fast paced. I also really
  enjoyed the scene when the security lasers were slicing up the
  team. The Red Queen was an interesing villain as well, maybe even
  more so than the licker. Overall, this movie is way worth seeing
  and having if you are a fan or even if you aren't a fan of the
  games. The movie is just fun</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">I was just surfing the shelves at Borders
  today when I stumbled over Queen Kelly on DVD! I couldn't believe
  it. I have just been getting interested in silent films (I'm 18)
  and of course I'm a Gloria Swanson fan (who isn't?), having seen
  her brilliant performance in Sunset Blvd. Anyway, I had always
  heard rumors about Queen Kelly - the incomplete, forgotten
  masterpiece. I had to pay a whopping [money] for this DVD, but it
  is definitely a piece of art and worth every penny. First of all,
  this film is old. You can hear it creak and moan at times and the
  orchestra soundtrack has not aged well - let's just say the music
  is annoyingly intense. But the age of the film just makes it more
  haunting to watch. The story takes place in the 20s, but you
  could almost believe it was hundreds of years ago. Now I want to
  concentrate on the story and the performances. Gloria Swanson's
  performance in Queen Kelly has to be one of her best - she was
  every bit as good in this film as in Sunset Blvd. We can easily
  see why she was such a huge silent star - her emotions and beauty
  carry the film just as much as the fascinating story. This was
  really melodrama at its best. People tend to forget, I think,
  that melodrama can be an art form, stressing wistful idealism and
  instead of cynical realism! The main event here is the story -
  wow! It's tragic that the film (and the story) were never
  finished. But who knows? It's just begging for a megabucks remake
  with Nicole Kidman. Now that the musicals are back, maybe silents
  will be next</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">Truly his greatest film I have seen thus
  far. Not only is one taken in by this movie, but it allows one to
  forget that it's filmed in black and white. The boy, Elvis, of
  course, is even more beautiful in KING CREOLE. Which leads me to
  believe he believed in his work for this picture. The soundtrack
  is admirable. He delivered it with such effervescence, such
  pride. One can't help but fall in love with him and this movie.
  Too bad Elvis was so loyal to Col. Parker. He could have been the
  great dramatic actor he had always wanted to be. This film
  certainly promised it</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">this movie is nothing special, it's not
  super awesome but it's still good. i'm the triple shot gun thing
  is awesome and it's fairly gory. if you're into dead alive,
  cannibal holocaust, the return of the living dead movies, and
  just cheap funny/gory zombie movies i recomend this movie</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">I am from India,and Megadeth is one of the
  few metal bands with a huge following here.From the few bootlegs
  of live shows that I did manage to get hold of,this seems to be
  one of the best gigs ever.Mustaine's singing is as good as it
  gets live ( if you think it is bad,then you have'nt heard him
  elsewhere ).But such minor foibles aside,the gig is f'in
  awesome.The setlist is almost perfect.The biggest pro is that
  most songs have been improvised.I love that.I used to hate the
  fact that Megadeth played CD perfect versions of their
  tracks,which was not fun.I'd rather listen to the CD with better
  production and singing.But here,they have really streched quiet a
  bit and given the audience,a stellar musical show.Jimmy De Grasso
  ( tho' he looks a bit nervous in my opinion ) is unbelievaly
  tight.He looks like he is appearing for a test,when he's playing
  the solo on she wolf ( you can see the tension on his face),but
  wotta solo....the sticks alsmost blur out.The sound and picture
  quality is great too.My only grouse is that the band has almost
  no audience interaction and there's very lil bonus stuff on the
  CD....some soundchecks or pre gig preparations thrown in would
  have rocked...they need to learn a thing or two from the 'tallica
  guys about this.But that apart...brilliant gig...a must for any
  metalhead</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">We all feel alone at times... this is
  something 'lost in translation' brilliantly shows its audience..
  Indeed loneliness often, paradoxically, occurs in highly
  populated areas.. It is as if the more people we are surrounded
  by the more alienated we feel - the more our differences stand
  out... Bill Murray is superbly cast as the outsider celebrity
  guy, who dosen't seem to quite know why he is where he is, and
  why he is treated the way he is - in a culture and a pace of life
  so distant from his way of seeing and experiencing reality.. This
  is a very promosing feature from sofia coppola.. It captures
  hotel life in a way that only direct experiene could top.. This
  also sort of represents the zenith of Bill murray's career and
  perhaps his best performance to date.</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">Very good movie. Great acting &amp;amp;
  plot. Very touching. I am very glad I own this movie. I will
  watch it very often</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">&amp;amp;quot;Above Suspicion&amp;amp;quot;
  offers both a plausible plot and realistic character portrayals.
  The dilemma of the story becomes apparent when a family man's
  (Bakula's) past comes back to haunt him, consequently tearing his
  life and his family apart. His wife (Sciorra) becomes more and
  more unsure of her husband as the story progresses.
  &amp;amp;quot;Above Suspicion&amp;amp;quot; has the qualities of
  an intense psychological thriller, as well as a heart warmer.
  It's a must see for almost any movie fan. Just don't confuse this
  &amp;amp;quot;Above Suspicion&amp;amp;quot; with the film
  starring Christopher Reve</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">While the dubbing may be a little annoying,
  I still love this movie. The fight scenes are great and the movie
  is pretty funny at times. Driving motorcycles over cars will
  always be cool in my book. Don't expect the deepest movie in the
  world, but do expect a quality martial arts film</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">Collateral Damage is the great and partially
  real action film in which Arnold Schwarzenger plays a fireman
  hell bent on getting his hands on the Terrorist who killed his
  wife and kid and many other citizens near a shopping mall. With
  the attacks on Sept 11 , movies have tried to cash in but
  Collateral Damage is different. Arnold even dedicated the movie
  to firefighters everywhere in an interview with Byron Allen. The
  movie is brilliant in showing what only what the motivation
  behind terrorist attacks , but the depiction of slow agencies
  like fbi to counter these terrorist attacks. Basically, the FBI
  and CIA tell Gorden Brewer(Arnold Schwarzennger) that they are
  working to bring down the terrorist who killed his family, when
  in fact they have no good leads on the suspect. Rather, than
  sitting on his butt, and waiting for the FBI to do something,
  Gordon takes the law into his own hands and seeks to get justice
  for his family by going into Columbia and getting ''The
  Wolf''(Cliff Curtis) as the terrorist is called. There is a great
  scene in which Gordon goes crazy and literally beats the hell out
  of a cold-blooded radio news reporter who says that the victims
  are pure garbage by saying their ''collateral damage''. The radio
  reporter explains the reasons behind terrorist attacks but shows
  no feeling for victims. I loved this scene, because this reporter
  clearly has no remorse for the dead. He probably has no family of
  his own, and doesn't know the meaning of life, except to cover
  his own. Now you might say to yourself what's the difference
  between Arnold's character (who is going for justice) and the
  terrorist well here is the big difference from Arnold himself:
  ''The difference between me and you is that I am only going to
  kill you''. Unbelievable action and twists at the end, that
  you're literally be on the edge of youre seat, and just when you
  think the movie is over.... it's not !!! Director Andrew Davis
  not only gives a fact type based movie based on Columbia, but
  also a factual based type movie that deals with Terrorism and the
  lessons that we must learn to see that things like this don't
  happen again. In fact, most people will remember the horrible
  case of Wall Street Reporter , Daniel Pearl, who was executed
  after the U.S. failed to meet the demands of the Middle East
  terrorist holding. The U.S. should have gone after these
  terrorists like the way Arnold does in this movie. but then the
  U.S. does not have a great track record when it comes to nailing
  terrorist even going back to the 1970's the U.S. supported and
  backed up madmen like General Pinochet in Chile and dictator
  Samoza in Nicaragua. Both of them killed hundreds of people with
  U.S. backing and funding. Still though ''Collateral Damage'' is a
  great action film that you must see.</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">This DVD is way cool with a buch of sport
  themed episodes. First Scooby and the gang help a baseball hero
  break a home run record, but the ghost of Cab Crag isn't too
  happy about having his record broken. Then they compete in a off
  road race with a giant worm as a competitor - and what's with the
  worm worshipers -I mean they go like whoo "a giant worm is our
  god, whoo we hate cars". Then they go to the Bocephus wrestling
  facility. Could they come up with a better name than Bocephus?
  There's a really freaky creature which may scare your little
  sister. The last episode is, by far, the best. A hockey ghost is
  terrorizing the World Cup Hockey event. He's one of the toughest
  ghosts ever, either that, or the Russian Police are the biggest
  whimps ever! I think this DVD is a good buy if you are a Scooby
  fan, just be prepared, it can get a little goofy. Joey</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">"The Petrified Forest" is a filmed version
  of the 1935 Broadway smash. The play starred Leslie Howard and
  Humphrey Bogart and their stage performances were preserved when
  Warner Brothers bought the play to the screen in late 1935. The
  addition of Bette Davis made good box office sense as she was
  beginning to hit her stride and was reteamed with Howard after
  their earlier matching in "Of Human Bondage". The film is set in
  the Arizona desert. A killer on the run holds up in a road house
  taking hostage a group of people there. The play has a few things
  to say about "the meaning of life" with the juxtaposition of
  outcast wanderer and intellectual Alan Squier played by Leslie
  Howard and vicious gangster Duke Mantee played by Humphrey
  Bogart. The morality is fairly corny now and most of it is
  contained in the dialogue of Leslie Howard but he delivers it
  superbly so it still has some resonance. The film was a
  breakthrough for Bogart but his performance is too theatrical for
  my liking. Davis is a revelation acting with a simplicity and
  freshness which is almost unique in her career. She is also very
  well photographed by Sol Polito and her big eyes glow. The DVD
  print is excellent and a lot of extras are included, including an
  expert and very detailed commentary about the film, a terrible
  Vitaphone short with the absurd Toby Wing and a funny cartoon
  about the Cocoanut Grove. The radio performance included is
  almost unintelligible with a very poor Tyrone Power in Howard's
  role. The DVD is excellent value especially if it is purchased as
  part of the Warners Gangster Collection.</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">I think a lot of people miss the power of
  this movie. To me this is a scathing view of how simple minded
  religious people are duped by Ministries in this country. Even
  though this was made some years ago before the advent of the
  infamous TV Ministries today, the message is still clear. Those
  who have only a simplistic relgious outlook are prey for the kind
  of charletans portrayed in this movie. This is certainly one of
  Burt Lancaster's better roles, and he plays it with much guesto!
  If we were to look at most of the popular Ministers today we
  would find that many are from this dark kind of background. This
  movie has a strong message. Don't listen to the word of God from
  others. If you must believe in the wild stories of the Bible, do
  so in your own way. Do not sanction phoney churches and preachers
  with your time and money! Even in this modern day and age, the
  influence of this kind of hokem is still strong. Mr. Bush and the
  Republican Party used it as a means to seek re-election! Everyone
  who is a born again Christian, or a church goer of any kind
  should see this movie and perhaps get a better understanding of
  what the religious industry is in this country. The ending of the
  film is perhaps a bit contrived, meant to imply the dangers of
  man assuming the powers of the Almighty (if there is one). Still,
  a powerful film for its time and contains a worthwhile message
  for viewers today.</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">A Night Out with the Backstreet Boys was a
  romantic dvd. Each of the five guys gets their own solo turns. It
  also includes songs that are never heard by any bsb fans. It's
  definitely a great dvd. A must-buy for every bsb lover! Go grab
  one for yourself if you haven't yet!</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">The show is absolutely GREAT! Blue Falcon is
  another Space Ghost and Dynomut is the futuristic version of
  Scooby Doo. Dim witted and loveable. Getting the complete show is
  great and the shows from these HB vaults are all looking pretty
  good with bright and vivid colors (amid some nasty scratches and
  dust, but it WAS cheap animation folks). As a Scooby fan this is
  a MUST own! I quite enjoy the Blue Falcon/Dynomut show also. 5
  stars for the show. The set however nice still drops the ball,
  you get two single sided dvds and two flippers. The problem with
  this is that the dvds are all on top of each other with maybe a
  1/16th of an inch between them both. I know this was to cut down
  on costs but it makes the two flipper discs quite hard to get out
  without scratching them or marking them up with a good
  fingerprint smear. But then again if it was a perfect world we
  couldn't complain. All in all a solid set! 4 1/2 out of 5</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">I thought the video was well done. It was
  good to feature the clinching games of the Division and League
  Championship Series plus all four games of the World Sries. I
  think they should have included at least the high- lights on a
  extra disk of Games 1 and 2 of the Division Series against Boston
  and Games 1, 2, 3 and 4 of the League Championship Series against
  Los Angeles. Still, I highly recommend this collection for all
  gung-ho White Sox fans who cherish the memory of the most
  exciting season in 88 years. A great viewing companion for those
  cold winter nights</Text>
  <Text category="dvd">Absolutely riveting performance by Noah
  Taylor as the thirty-year old Adlof Hitler. The story is very

  <Text category="health">I've found the Omron very easy and
  practical to use. It gives very good estimates of body fat
  percentages and BMI (body mass index) which can easily be used to
  illustrate a personal rate of progress for any dietary or weight
  training program. For the money, it would be difficult to find
  something better</Text>
  <Text category="health">I've been using the Omron HBF-306 Body
  Fat Analyzer for a month or so now. So far I've been very
  impressed with its consistency. However, I would have to go to a
  doctor and get some sort of analysis and compare that with the
  Omron's measurements to see how accurate it is. It's well built
  and very easy to use. Once you set up your profile, it only takes
  a few seconds to get a read. I would give it 5 stars but again I
  dont yet have anything to compare its measurements with. Still a
  good product at a good price.</Text>
  <Text category="health">I bought this gadget with the intent of
  monitoring my daily steps to get an idea of where I was currently
  to establish some sort of baseline so that I could get a reality
  check on my activity levels. I opened the box, read the easy
  directions, set up my personal step measurement (just measure off
  the distance of your 10 steps), and clipped it on my pants and
  forgot about it for the day. I was surprised to find out that a
  corpse could probably move around more during the day than me!
  Over the next 6 days, (this pedometer keeps track of 7 days of
  steps for you); I literally stepped up my game and went from 756
  steps with NO aerobic exercise on day 1, to 7,880 steps with 30
  minutes of nonstop aerobic exercise on day 3! Every day has been
  getting easier to achieve the 10,000 "normal" steps, and
  increasing the aerobic steps too (which are tracked separately).
  I can press the mode button, check out how many miles my steps
  translate to, kilocalories burned, aerobic steps, and compare it
  with the past 7 days as well. It has turned out to be even more
  fun than what I originally bought it for. I actually feel better,
  and the fun part is that I am trying to beat my own personal
  record from the previous day! This has been an eye-opening
  experience for me, and I keep this on or in my pocket all the
  time now, just to make sure I keep a mindful eye on my steps and
  aerobic activity for the day</Text>
  <Text category="health">Great features! Probably the best
  pedometer out there for the money. The only reason I give 4 vice
  5 stars, is that I think the one I bought for my mom (same brand
  and model) is slightly more accurate. A great way to track your
  fitness overall</Text>
  <Text category="health">pedometer is great! Easy to use,
  accurate. Highly recommend it</Text>
  <Text category="health">This is the best tasting energy bar I
  have ever had. My kids love them too. Great high energy
  snack</Text>
  <Text category="health">I really like these things. They're
  certainly chewy, so they can be a bit of a jaw workout, but they
  taste pretty good while having a lot more nutritional value than
  a candy bar, and they keep you going for a couple of hours. If
  only they were a little cheaper, say a dollar or less per bar,
  I'd probably go through them a lot more quickly than I do right
  now</Text>
  <Text category="health">I was really enjoying my Oregon
  Scientific Pedometer, I found it easy to use and accurate;
  however, after 1 month it accidentally fell on the floor, and
  that was it, it no longer works...I will probably buy another
  one, but it needs to be treated with kid-gloves.</Text>
  <Text category="health">I still have ther original blackmans
  shaver purchased in 1977 it still works! this one works even
  better I have tried other remington shavers over the years the
  850 9300 and the 9500 none of them worked as well as the first
  one untill now! I found that by shaving in small circular motion
  as you move along your face you won't need williams lectric shave
  as I had with the other razors and it's much easier to claen! now
  if the just keep making replacement baldes I will be very happy
  for a long time</Text>
  <Text category="health">I bought this product because I had a
  borderline high reading at my doctor's office. Rather than having
  the hassle of going to his office and paying a cop-pay just to
  have it monitored, we purchased this unit. It works wonderful.
  Very simple and gives more information than I expected</Text>
  <Text category="health">This is very easy to use and quite
  convenient. I'm not sure, however, how accurate this monitor is.
  It seems to record a higher reading than a manual one at times.
  The value of this home monitor is if the readings change
  dramatically. THen it's a warning to go to the doctor's</Text>
  <Text category="health">This has got to be one of the easiest
  blood pressure monitors to use. It really doesn't start until
  your arm is in the correct position, letting you know by beeping
  when you've got it right. The display is large and easy to read
  and understand. I definitely would recommend this</Text>
  <Text category="health">Very happy with this purchase. Received
  it in a reasonable time and at a great price including the rebate
  for signing up for an [...] credit card. It is easy to use and
  seems more accurate than the wrist type monitors. I like the
  History feature in order to determine the average blood pressure
  over a long period of time since pressures change daily!Good
  machine especially since it has an AC adapter so that there is no
  need to change batteries frequently!Also, the intellisense
  feature makes sure the cuff is always properly inflated before
  readings</Text>
  <Text category="health">I just finished a 4 day golf tournament
  that was brutal. 6 hour rounds played in 90 degree heat with high
  humidity. During a practice round a couple of days before the
  tournament started I really got drained of energy after about 12
  holes. I was unprepared and it made a sport that I normally enjoy
  into an unpleasant experience. For the tournament rounds I packed
  a small cooler with Gatorade, Nature Valley Fruit and Nut bars,
  and chocolate flavored Clif Builder's bars. I drank water and
  gatorade throughout each round and alternated the bars every 3-4
  holes. It really made a difference. Each day I felt like I had
  the energy and endurance for a great round. If only my golf game
  was as good as these bars. They tasted great and keeping them in
  a cooler kept them from melting in the heat. I highly recommend
  Chocolate Clif Builder's bars. Kevin Decke</Text>
  <Text category="health">These bars are absolutely fantastic. They
  are very nutritious and have a good amount of protein (20g). They
  taste pretty good, far better than most bars. I prefer the
  builder bar cookies and cream flavor to that of the clif bar
  flavor. Out of the flavors my current favorite is the cookies and
  cream, next being the peanut butter, and then chocolate. A
  chocolate mint flavor has just been released but I have yet to
  try it. I recommend these bars to anyone looking for a healthy
  snack or needing protein for working out</Text>
  <Text category="health">Just wanted to note that my delicious
  bars arrived MELTED as noted by another reviewer. I ended up
  placing in the fridge, and then taking out before eating. Turns
  out, I didn't find them that great directly from the fridge.
  Also, they just didn't taste as fresh as the ones I buy
  individually from Wal-Mart. I couldn't tell if that was because
  they had melted, or just weren't as fresh to start with</Text>
  <Text category="health">I originally ordered a Tanita scale and
  it stopped working within two weeks. (Amazon, of course, took it
  back with no problems.) I was so glad when the Omron scale
  arrived. It costs less than the Tanita but the quality is much
  higher. The numbers on it are very large and easy to read. Also,
  it is much easier to place your feet properly than on the Tanita.
  I can't wait to try all the features. By the way, I weighed
  myself over and over and my weight only varied .2 lbs. as
  promised. Great deal for the money!!!</Text>
  <Text category="health">I recently started Weight Watchers and
  was looking to purchase a new and accurate scale. I figured I
  would buy a WW product, but after reading the reviews, I decided
  to go with the Omron scale. I am very pleased with this product.
  It has been extremely accurate. It keeps a history for both my
  husband and I. I would highly recommend this scale to anyone! It
  is also an attractive scale which is a bonus. Go with the Omron
  scale</Text>
  <Text category="health">After reading the review regarding palm
  kernel oil in all of the Luna Bar flavors, I decided to read all
  the ingredients for each flavor myself. I noticed that the Luna
  Bar Toasted Nuts 'n' Cranberry flavor is the only flavor that
  does not contain palm kernel oil. If you are concerned about palm
  kernel oil you should purchase this flavor. The toasted nuts 'n'
  cranberry flavor is delicious, doesn't taste like a candy bar,
  and has low total and saturated fat gram percentages. Luna Bar
  Toasted Nuts 'n' Cranberry flavor is one of the better nutrition
  bars available on the market.</Text>
  <Text category="health">The Cherry Covered Choccolate Luna Bars
  are quite tasty. Chances are, if you're eating a chocolate cherry
  nutrition bar, you need a little enticement to eat healthy. Like
  all these bars you do get sick of the same flavor day after day.
  I recommend alternating between these and another bar that's not
  so sweet (kashi trail mix bars are perfect). That helps me stick
  to the bars instead of hitting up the zillion calorie pastries at
  the corner coffee shop</Text>
  <Text category="health">This monitor is so easy to use, and more
  convenient than going to the grocery store. It saves the readings
  in memory, so if I don't have a pen and paper handy, I can
  retrieve the info later. It even shows the time the reading was
  taken.</Text>
  <Text category="health">My wife had high BP, so we got this
  model. The reasons for choosing this model were that: 1. the
  upper arm monitors are supposed to be more accurate 2. it was
  cheaper than the fully automatic models 3. Omron seems to be one
  of the better/best brands. 4. Supposedly, the pumps on the fully
  automatic models are prone to breaking. The unit appears well
  built (including the hand pump). It is easy to operate, and it
  seems very accurate. We checked its readings with an fully manual
  unit that we have at home, and the automatic unit at the drug
  store. We find it takes very accurate and consistent readings.
  People with physical limitations might find the hand pump
  inconvenient. Also, people with a big arm might need to buy the
  larger cuff. I'm overweight right now, so the cuff barely fits my
  arm, but fits my wife's nicely (it was bought for her)</Text>
  <Text category="health">This blood pressure monitor is everything
  I was looking for and the price was certainly right. Thank you.
  It works perfectly</Text>
  <Text category="health">i find the item in perfect shape and
  operates effectively thank you so much bimvik</Text>
  <Text category="health">Unbeatable for the price! Worked fine
  right out of the box. Easy to use and easy to understand
  instructions. I'm glad I bought it</Text>
  <Text category="health">My physician introduced me to this item.
  He said very accurate when compaired to the water and pinching
  methods. Is affordable and easy to use. Oh, did I forget to
  mention, accurate compaired to a scale model I own. Amazon is
  great to order from, the online ordering was easy and the product
  arrived in 5 days!</Text>

  <Text category="health">I encountered these at last week's
  Carlsbad Triathlon. They tasted really good and I figured if it's
  good enough for the military, I'll give it a try...sure enough,
  the military knows what it's doing--it seems to work as claimed.
  Thumbs up, or, Hooah</Text>
  <Text category="health">We use the ZBars for breakfast, and my
  kids love them! I love them too, as they're organic, contain no
  trans fat, no refinded sugar or flour. They're yummy AND
  healthy</Text>
  <Text category="health">Out of the 3 flavors available, this one
  is the favorite of both my boys (4yrs and 7yrs). BUT no matter
  what flavor its a snack they both will eat and enjoy!</Text>
  <Text category="health">I came across the Hooah drink because my
  boss--a retired military man running for office--always has a
  case lying around. With campaign season heating up and workdays
  getting crazy long, these are invaluable for getting me through
  the day, and keeping my thoughts coherent. Apparently military
  studies said these drinks improve alertness by fifty percent. I
  can't measure that in myself of course, but I do sense a dramatic
  improvement</Text>
  <Text category="health">This is a great drink. I wanted to try
  something that was different, and this definately fit in. It isnt
  carbonated, and tastes really good. What I really wanted to know
  though, was how it worked. There is no caffeine or taurine, and
  the ingredients list didnt really show anything out of the
  ordinary. It worked well though, and I was able to stay focused
  for a long time after drinking it</Text>
  <Text category="health">This shaver has met all my expectations.
  It cleans and recharges itself automatically. The shave is close
  and nick free. The only slight negative is the cleaning time per
  shave could run to 20 minutes</Text>
  <Text category="health">My husband said it is a very good shaver.
  It took a few days to get used to the shaving head because he has
  always used the Norelco shavers with three rotating heads. The
  Braun is a closer shave. The cleaning system works very well and
  it is easy to handle</Text>
  <Text category="health">I have owned this pulse meter for
  approximately 2 weeks and I find it to be accurate, but it takes
  a while for it to give a reading. The first few times I used it,
  it took over a minute to tell me my pulse. However, the manual
  does state that when you become used to the correct positioning
  of your finger on the sensor it will give a result faster. So
  far, this is true, as within the last 3 days, I have received
  readings within 10 seconds consistently. Considering the price,
  it was a good purchase</Text>
  <Text category="health">If you are trying to learn relaxation
  through biofeedback, this is the product to buy. Packaging,
  support, presentation, and hardware/software quality are the best
  that I have seen. No down side. It's not a game in the usual
  sense. More of a way to learn techniques in a quiet and amusing
  way. There is room for a little mischief. Instead of allowing the
  balloons to flow smoothly, I tried busting a few. Type A
  personality shows through occasionally. I will be purchasing the
  next item in the series. I am learning to relax, at will, which
  will be helpful in my high-stress occupation. Good luck</Text>
  <Text category="health">I have had so much fun learning Bio

  <Text category="health">Philips sent me a reprogram plug-in that
  took me only 10 minutes to change the settings to meet the new
  standards. Most of the low price AED's use camaera batteries. My
  defibrillator has a long life lithium battary. I won't risk
  someone's life on store-bought battaries. Walt Blankenshi</Text>
  <Text category="health">As an ER/Trauma nurse I have seen and
  been involved in many, many cardiac arrests. Here is some
  information that you need to know 1) You must still perform
  adequate CPR, if not brain death occurs within 4 minutes of
  oxygen deprivation to the brain! 2) Even with trained personnel,
  CPR, a defibrillator and Advanced Cardiac Life Support
  (medications) the survival rate is very, very low. I am not
  telling you this to discourage purchasing this AED it is a
  wonderful unit I have been trained on it and had to use it once.
  I am letting you know that if you are willing to spend over $1000
  on a defibrillator (especially for a private home)then a good
  idea would be to spend another $50 and take a basic CPR class. I
  hope that no one that buys this ever has to use it!!</Text>

  <Text category="health">At church today I came upon a man who had
  partially collapsed. Since I'm a physician, I stopped and offered
  aid. It turns out that he had a history of heart disease and was
  having some pretty concerning symptoms. To my dismay, we do not
  have an AED at our church (yet). We notified 911, and he was
  taken for medical care without any problems, but I was a bit
  worried there for a few minutes. While I'm trained in BLS, that
  is, at best, a temporizing measure. AEDs have a proven ability to
  diagnose and treat fatal heart rhythms. In my opinion, places of
  public gathering should consider purchasing one of these devices.
  I'll be working with our church to see if we can get one. I would
  have been a bit more relaxed waiting for EMS if I had had one of
  these today. However, buying an AED is not a cure-all. I have
  been trained on these, and they are very simple to learn to use.
  However, I think it would be quite difficult for someone who had
  never used one use it correctly during the stress of a cardiac
  arrest. If you are considering buying an AED for home or public
  use, I strongly suggest reading the section on AEDs at the
  American Heart Association website. It discusses some of the
  important preparations to consider before the purchase of such a
  device. So, while not for everyone, this is one of the few
  products available that can truly save lives. In the right
  situation, it is indispensable.</Text>
  <Text category="health">As an Emergency Nurse Practitioner and
  Paramedic, I cannot emphasize enough the importance of getting
  electricity to an adult who is suffering from cardiac arrest.
  Technology is moving quickly to get electricity to the cardiac
  arrest victim earlier and earlier -- and the survival rates AND
  quality of life rates after such an arrest are sky rocketing
  accordingly. Is there too much direct-to-consumer marketing by
  medical-related companies? Probably. Is your personal risk for
  experiencing sudden cardiac arrest per calendar year low?
  Definitely. ...but do those smug reviewers refuse to buy vehicles
  with airbags in them just because their risk of being in an
  accident is low and the direct-to-consumer marketing is
  irritating to them? No! Those will be the same folks who want
  their cars with anti-lock breaks, airbags, the best side-impact
  reinforcements... and being a good driver (ie, "just improve your
  diet") won't cancel their risk for being in an accident. I hope
  you never have to use this machine, but as an emergency
  healthcare worker -- both pre-hospital and in the emergency room
  -- I cannot say enough positive about AED's in the community
  setting! Don't run out and purchase this out of paranoia, however
  if yuo are at risk for a sudden cardiac event consider if this
  would be appropriate for you, your family members, your apartment
  building, your church, etc. ...and rest assured that it is
  absolutely safe -- it is impossible to hurt a loved one with
  this, you can only help. ...and to those who gave negative
  reviews on this AED? Don't forget to pay your car
  insurance!..</Text>

  <Text category="health">These are very tasty. They take care of a

  tough beard. I'll break out or rash up if my skin gets irritated,
  so I have to carefully prep for shaving. After years of trial and
  error, I've finally settled on a good shaving cream system:
  Cetaphil Skin Cleanser for a base, then Kiss My Face Moisture
  Shave as a supplement. For post-shave comfort and to prevent
  breakouts, I use a product like Clean&amp;amp;Clear Dual-Action
  Oil-Free moisturizing lotion. However, the weak link up until now
  has been the actual shaver. With the Gillette Fusion Power, I've
  finally found the right one. I've used Gillette since they gave
  my unit free razors during the first Gulf War (I was in the
  Marines at the time). They've gotten the job done, but a 3-blade
  system is ultimately inadequate for my beard and skin type. It
  doesn't take long for the blades to start cutting my face and
  neck, especially since I take forever to change blades. I dreaded
  looking in a bathroom mirror at work and seeing dried blood spots
  (not to mention getting blood stains on my collar). Electric
  shavers don't work for me either - too hard on my skin, and I'd
  have a five-o'clock shadow around 2PM. So, when I saw Gillette
  touting their new 5-blade system, I gave it a shot. I was
  initially skeptical about the powered aspect due to my issues
  with electric shavers. But the Fusion Power is the happy
  exception. At first I struggled a bit getting the battery cap off
  of the end. But once I mastered that maneuver and got the battery
  in, I was set. It takes one AAA-battery that seems to last a
  decent interval (the low-battery indicator is a nice touch). And
  even if the Fusion Power runs out of juice, you can still shave
  with it. The shaver glides over my face, and the vibration feels
  good - kind of like a pick-me-up in the morning. The five blades
  really nail my beard, and even tough spots like my chin and jaw
  line remain cut-free. I also like the one-blade trimmer on top -
  very handy for evening out my sideburns and zapping those stray
  whiskers right under my nostrils. My only issue is the expense of
  the blades. But I can make them last a lot longer than the old
  3-blade razors while still getting a great shave. And most
  importantly, I rarely get those annoying cuts anymore (if I do,
  it's more because of rushing or clumsiness than anything else).
  Ultimately, the result is worth the higher price. The Gillette
  Fusion Power is the best shaver I've ever tried. Highly
  recommended</Text>
  <Text category="health">I mean come ON, who needs 5 blades right?
  Well, after thoughtful consideration of the major improvement
  that the Mach III was over a twin head razor, I decided that $10
  was worth the price of a cheap thrill so I took the plunge, and
  to my surprise this thing works beyond my expectations. The first
  thing I noticed was that this new Fusion has a more powerful
  engine than the Mach III. The second thing I found was that this
  razor gives me a much closer shave than the Mach III, and with
  very little effort, and those tight spots that my old razor would
  always miss are not a problem anymore. And I find this razor to
  be very comfortable without a single nick that others have
  complained about. But I do use this razor strictly for my face if
  you know what I mean. haw haw 5 Blade</Text>

  <Text category="health">I was surprised to open this pedometer
  page after sometime and see all the negative reviews it receives.
  I have been using this specific model for more than 3 months now
  and I am really satisfied with it. It is really accurate
  (&amp;amp;lt;1% declination, I have performed more than four
  tests of more than 400 steps during different times of its life
  and I have seen a couple of cheap pedometers performing much
  worse), clips firmly to belt or pants, displays the time
  conveniently and has nice backlight, even has a radio which
  works, although as most people said, not really its best feature.
  The truth is that I am not using the radio at all, mostly because
  I believe the batteries will last longer and it will save me from
  extra trips to Walmart. But I have tested it and it works,
  although nothing impressive there. Of course, for the money, I
  think you cannot go wrong with this pedometer. One funny comment
  is that, although most people complain it cannot open very
  easily, after sometime it will open more easily that you think.
  Actually it has been a couple of times where putting a bag on my
  shoulders or a waist pouch and applying some pressure on it by
  mistake, will open it wide, so it does not count any steps. But
  it does not open by itself anyway, needs external force for this
  to happen, so it does not happen often. All in all, I am sure
  that the plastic construction and the less than rigorous
  production testing will result in many pieces that do not
  function properly and will result in bad reviews. Maybe I have
  been lucky, maybe not, but this has been one of the best and most
  reliable devices that I carry and use every day. And a great
  incentive for walking and exercising more</Text>

  certified 95% organic. These organic ingredients include organic
  rolled oats, organic oat Flour, organic oat fiber, organic and

  <Text category="health">I'm writing to correct a few factual
  errors in other reviews. One reviewer claimed that Soldier Fuel
  contains no energy ingredients. This is untrue. Soldier Fuel was
  formulated by military labs specifically to provide steady energy
  to troops. Carbohydrates are the body's primary source of energy.
  Soldier Fuel contains 29 g of complex carbs (the carbs that give
  long-lasting energy) and 12 g of sugar. The U.S. Military labs
  deemed this the perfect ratio to give you both a quick burst of
  energy and no crash. Most other energy drinks on the market have
  lots of sugar and caffeine. Since caffeine is a stimulant and not
  a source of energy, the result is a quick spike in energy
  followed by a crash. Another error is that Soldier Fuel has more
  sugar. It has less. One 12 oz. can of Soldier Fuel has 12 g of
  sugar. The same amount of Gatorade contains 21 g of sugar. The
  same amount of Red Bull has 39g sugar. Finally, the support for
  the troops is not marketing hype. Our company is partnered with
  the U.S. Military's Natick Soldier Center. A portion of the gross
  proceeds from each can of HOOAH! Soldier Fuel and each HOOAH! bar
  directly funds research that improves the safety, diet, and
  quality of life of our troops</Text>

  <Text category="health">For many years I Couldn't use a electric
  shaver because it was always a incomplete shave, so after each

  the years That razor went obsolete so I started to look for a new
  replacement. I read some of the reviews. I read "the refills are
  costly ... hello... 4$ a month?, then I read doesn't do a good

  Its like magic each time I use it(cleans itself each time" its

  <Text category="health">My wife and I have used this a few times
  now and really like it. From a novice's point of view, this is a
  great meditation aid. I like being able to get the visual
  feedback as I calm and center myself. I guess the hardest part is
  not letting myself get too anxious as I try to accomplish the
  task in front of me. It's also a very pretty game with very lush
  and detailed visuals as well as a nice soundtrack</Text>
  <Text category="health">This is a fantastic tool for self
  improvement and relaxation and a flawed but acceptable game by
  gaming standards alone. The biofeedback hardware/software is
  excellent and you WILL make progress whether your goals are
  stress reduction, better meditation, building higher self-esteem,
  maybe even reaching higher states of consciousness etc...The
  "biofeedback events" are diverse and well designed and generally
  just great to use! Most of the in-game advice is also fantastic
  and there are a few "easter eggs" which offer very practical
  tools to help build your self esteem, realize your goals
  etc...Much of the *substance* of this project is masterfully
  achieved (though there are a few cheesy moments). That said the
  interface etc. needs help, it can be downright frustrating, and
  the relatively low-res graphics can be a strain on some screens.
  Thankfully these issues have been addressed in the expansion pack
  Wisdom Quest, which I also highly recommend. Overall, this is a
  really innovative and great product. Also a good investment as
  far as biofeedback devices go since there will likely be more
  expansion packs and third-party software to come</Text>
  <Text category="health">I finally received this product in the
  mail after knowing about it for a year. I can't say I'm a huge
  fan of Deepak Chopra. He presents some good ideas, but from what
  I can tell he seems to consider meditation to be more of a
  mechanism for mind and body control, leading to bliss and
  relaxation, rather than a tool for unbiased self knowledge, to
  come to terms with all the things that one rather might ignore. I
  find this bias is reflected in the game. As a game in itself, it
  is pretty good - its graphics and its originality - and learning
  to relax and chill out may be useful for some people. I didn't
  find the process as compelling as I expected, though. I found I
  was able to learn some of the skills pretty fast, and other
  places I seemed to get stuck. One potential drawback is that if
  you get frustrated, and try to start forcing things to happen, it
  can defeat the purpose of meditation. The science of biofeedback
  is fairly new, and I can see its potential in the field of
  preventative health. I just wouldn't put the same New Age spin on
  things as Chopra does.</Text>
  <Text category="health">You can shave anything without putting
  future fatherhood at risk, though it takes some patience to get
  things really smooth. I've used it repeatedly over the past three
  months without any major problems. My skin was a little sensitive
  after the first time, but no terrible pain or anything, and
  there's none at all now that I'm accustomed to using it. It is
  possible to nick yourself if you press too hard while shaving,
  but if you read the instructions first you should be fine. A
  couple of very minor drawbacks: It's rather noisy, more so than a
  regular electric razor, and if you use the comb attachments, it's
  tough to remove them without also removing the foil screen at the
  same time. But that pops right back in, so not a big dea</Text>
  <Text category="health">This is a very good shaver for the
  private area. However, the key to getting the best results is to
  trim the longer hairs with scissors or the largest guard first.
  This will keep the shaver from pulling on the longer hairs and
  will enable the foil part of the shaver to work. The foil will
  not be able to do its job if the hairs are too long. The only
  problem I had with the shaver was that it did not enable me to
  shave my back like it claimed. However, I use the 'mangroomer'
  back shaver for this and it is perfect for you to shave off all
  your back hair easily with its elongated handle. it is a great
  product as well. Therefore, I would have to say these two
  products coupled together seem to cover all the bases for men's
  grooming on the body. I would highly recommend both of them for
  perfect manscaping results</Text>

  <Text category="health">My daughter Morgane, who is now 8 years
  old, has been suffering from delibitating migraines since infancy
  (yes, there is such a thing, unfortunately). The symptoms are
  very impressive, she usually drops to the floor and starts
  vomiting within a few minutes. She cannot move or open her eyes.
  It makes her very anxious and we noticed that she hyperventilates
  when she thinks she is going to "get dizzy". We tried to make her
  breathe slowly and calm down, to no avail. Morgane's doctor told
  us that breathing slowly and practicing biofeedback were the best
  non-drug practices against migraines, and we try to avoid giving
  Morgane medication as she is so young. So I thought of using
  RESPeRATE as my Dad has high-blood pressure and I knew it worked
  on the breathing pattern. Morgane immediately understood how to
  use the device, it was so easy and even fun for her. It relaxes
  her and gives her the strength to know she can do something about
  her migraines. Her breathing pattern has reduced considerably and
  so far, she has not had another migraine attack for about 6
  months. She used to have them every two months. I have purchased
  another device for my best friend, a long time migraine sufferer.

  before it starts to register the hart rate; I think it is because
  the sending unit needs some moisture to make good contact with
  your skin. I did have some trouble with the unit when I first
  started using it; I replaced the battery in the sending unit
  which solved the problem. The fact that the battery is user
  replaceable is one of the main reasons I picked the Omord brand.
  The HR-100C is a bare bones unit and does a good job if you are

  <Text category="health">Great product for the $ I spent. I picked
  it b/c I can replace the batteries myself and the cost was in my
  budget. It does jump around more than I'd like, but I can tell
  from the range that I am over or under my target heart rate. It
  does beep to let you know that, but I find it annoying so I turn
  it off. If you find you have trouble getting it to register your
  rate, then move it around a bit. Mine works best when I put it
  higher on my chest, in the area of my heart, just below my

  <Text category="health">This review is about the Oral-B Flexisoft
  replacement heads. Coupled with the Braun electric toothbrushes,
  this is one of the most effective aids to oral hygiene ever
  developed. My introduction to Oral-B goes back over 27 years to a
  USAF basic training briefing; a dental technician held up an
  Oral-B toothbrush with medium bristles and said "this is the
  toothbrush you need if you want to keep your teeth" or some such
  statement like that. Well, I haven't lost one yet. The motorized
  mechanicals of the toothbrush do most of the work while you guide
  the oscillating round head around and over your pearly whites.
  While the heads are undeniably pricey when looked at just in
  dollars and cents, there is value in the fact that the total
  package actually makes a rather mundane chore a little more fun
  while actually living up to the claim that it does a better job
  on your teeth than manual brushing. Since I've always believed
  the entire surface area of the toothbrush head was meant to be
  covered with toothpaste and the size of the head on these is
  smaller than the average brush, I know I'm using less toothpaste
  to do the same job. While this is no big deal, the long term
  economic benefit is plaque under control, healthy gums and a
  bright smile full of natural teeth. It's kind of hard to deny it
  works since my dentist has confirmed the positive results upon
  direct examination. Just be careful what model of these brush
  heads you are selecting and watch the pricing. Oral-B uses a kind
  of color code for the bristles, and the ones that have the
  colored indicator bristles in a line with the shaft are the
  Flexisoft model that seems to equate to medium hardness. Enjoy
  life</Text>
  <Text category="health">Now that I'm writing this review, it
  seems silly that I'm so happy over such a small thing as a
  toothbrush. But I am. I bought this item not long after I had my
  first (and hopefully only) root canal and crown four years ago,
  something which I never again want to experience in my life (as
  someone else described, it was painful and expensive). Growing
  up, I didn't take care of my teeth like I should've, so I'm
  accustomed to always being told there's either a cavity, or the
  start of one, and having to have more work done. After the root
  canal, my mom recommended a brush that had at least a certain
  number of pulsations/oscillations, because that's what she'd been
  recommended by her dentist to combat her receding gums. This
  specific item met those requirements, and it was affordable. When
  I first started using it, my gums were very sensitive to it, but
  that quickly wore off, so it seems to me that it strengthens the
  gums. It is also MUCH easier to get behind the front teeth.
  Subsequent dentist vists by my mom have shown that her gums have
  improved dramatically after using a high-quality electric
  toothbrush such as this one (I honestly don't remember if she has
  this exact model, but ours are similar), and I've not needed any
  work done at the dentist beyond regular cleanings since I
  purchased it. As far as cleaning the unit to keep it from
  "gunking" up, I'm the only person who uses this item, so any
  extra toothbrush heads are still in the package they came in, not
  dripping into the storage container; so I don't know how to
  combat that. But I just take the toothbrush head off the thing
  and rinse it, then rinse the hand-held part, and set them back on
  the unplugged charger/base (I only plug it in when the battery
  runs low) and things stay clean with no problem</Text>
  <Text category="health">This is a great product, easy to program
  and use.. easy to read digital display and very accurate</Text>
  <Text category="health">I recently started Weight Watchers and
  was looking to purchase a new and accurate scale. I figured I
  would buy a WW product, but after reading the reviews, I decided
  to go with the Omron scale. I am very pleased with this product.
  It has been extremely accurate. It keeps a history for both my
  husband and I. I would highly recommend this scale to anyone! It
  is also an attractive scale which is a bonus. Go with the Omron
  scale</Text>
  <Text category="health">My wife had high BP, so we got this
  model. The reasons for choosing this model were that: 1. the
  upper arm monitors are supposed to be more accurate 2. it was
  cheaper than the fully automatic models 3. Omron seems to be one
  of the better/best brands. 4. Supposedly, the pumps on the fully
  automatic models are prone to breaking. The unit appears well
  built (including the hand pump). It is easy to operate, and it
  seems very accurate. We checked its readings with an fully manual
  unit that we have at home, and the automatic unit at the drug
  store. We find it takes very accurate and consistent readings.
  People with physical limitations might find the hand pump
  inconvenient. Also, people with a big arm might need to buy the
  larger cuff. I'm overweight right now, so the cuff barely fits my
  arm, but fits my wife's nicely (it was bought for her)</Text>
  <Text category="health">It is really good enough for my need. I
  have no problems so far</Text>
  <Text category="health">I eat one of these twice a week before I
  play ice hockey. I specifically buy this flavor because it
  contains caffeine, though I don't perceive any "boost". It could
  be there and I'm just not noticing it. I feel they do the job of
  keeping me fueled for the workout. It would be nice if the
  package made a specific recommendation about how long before a
  workout to eat the Clif Bar. I find the size of a Clif bar a bit
  disappointing, especially considering the "store" price of $1.50.
  At $11 a case and with free shipping when spending $25 or more,
  I've not found a better price than Amazon's on Clif bars</Text>
  <Text category="health">I have very sensitive skin and tried wet
  shaving with several different electrics and this shave stick
  beats foam and loation hands down. As other reviewers point out
  the stick is made of talc in a parafin base. It makes dry shaving
  extremely smooth, as smooth as shaving with foam or lotion but
  without any of the mess. You can use this with any type of
  electric, not just Remingtons, and it's very easy to clean out,
  just tap it out and/or blow and/or brush. Highly
  recommende</Text>
  <Text category="health">I bought this one for my wife and she was
  really happy about the product. She personally like the product
  and really good</Text>
  <Text category="health">This was a perfect fit for my healthy
  lifestyle! What I found also very helpful was
  getyoursexyon.myarbonne.com it was the only thing that I never
  thought would be missing from trying to be healthy everyday.
  Guess there's enough people vouching for my all time fav cliff
  bars so I wanted to spread the word, I know I wish I would have
  found out sooner!</Text>
  <Text category="health">If you burn lots of calories in your
  activities, this high energy food could give you a lift. There
  are 250 calories packed into this little 2.4 ounce bar, which is
  advertised to be at least 70% organic. This bar is advertised to
  be for athletes first, and as a casual snack second. If you are
  overweight and trying to drop pounds, you can skip this snack and
  move back to unbuttered popcorn. When I opened this bar I noticed
  that it looks like compressed goop. However, the compressed goop
  tastes pretty good. The texture is much like a granola bar,
  though more moist than a granola bar. The black cherry part of
  the black cherry almond is understated. There are dried cherries
  in this mix rather than artificial cherry flavor, which is a big
  plus. I was unable to find anything in this bar that implied it
  was artificial, which is an even bigger plus. One thing that
  confused me a little is that the bar is advertised to have no
  wheat and no dairy, but the label on the bar states that there
  may be trace amounts of dairy. I guess they either knew there
  might be a very small amount of dairy or they were hedging
  themselves because of possible cross-contamination from some
  other process. In either case, vegens consider whether trace
  amounts of dairy makes this an acceptable product. The label also
  states that there may be traces of peanuts. This bar also
  contains 20% of the daily recommended dietary fiber, which means
  drinking lots of water is a good idea when eating this bar. There
  are also lots of vitamins and trace elements, which may be a good
  thing unless you take vitamin supplements, in which case you may
  need to consider whether you are getting too much of a good
  thing. Clif Bars could be a casual snack, but the ingredients and
  their marketing really suggest that they are geared toward
  individuals that are looking for a healthy energy boost in high
  energy activities. If you fall into that category, which could
  include hiking, climbing, bicycling, running, jogging, and other
  similarly strenuous activities, then this bar could be a good way
  of packing a big punch in a small package. Enjoy!</Text>
  <Text category="health">I really liked the outside design of the
  book. A lot of books were "cartoonish" and really was drawn to
  the look of the book. I wish the book did not have so much random
  fill-in pages. I had hoped that it would have blanks to fill in
  for different events/ages of the child. But all in all I am
  pleased with it. I would most likely buy again</Text>
  <Text category="health">My physician introduced me to this item.
  He said very accurate when compaired to the water and pinching
  methods. Is affordable and easy to use. Oh, did I forget to
  mention, accurate compaired to a scale model I own. Amazon is
  great to order from, the online ordering was easy and the product
  arrived in 5 days!</Text>
  <Text category="health">Useful Easy to use Good price I would
  recommend this product</Text>
  <Text category="health">It does what it advertises. The bodyfat
  readings do fluctuate, but that's normal, it gives you a good
  general idea of how much bodyfat you have, and it gives a simple
  reading of whether your bmi with your body fat is low, normal,
  high, too high. I got it for about 25 bucks so good buy.</Text>
  <Text category="health">Very handy that you can put it in your
  handbag wherever you go. You can use it to read those tiny words
  in the label when you are grocery shopping. Better than magnifier
  glass because the width of this bookmark covers the whole line of
  a page</Text>
  <Text category="health">I own an older dispensor, from around
  1999, and I was afraid that these filters wouldn't fit. They do
  and seem to work fine. I can't find a "replace" indicator on
  these new ones, the older filters had a sliding arrow to show
  when to replace them. I guess that I just have to replace it on a
  calendar basis, they say the filters are good for 2 months</Text>
  <Text category="health">I was very suprised at how small the
  units were (I ordered 2). But they work great and run very
  quietly. The filter is very easy to change. I have one downstairs
  in the living room and one upstairs that I switch from bedroom to
  bedroom and the units work well in that amount of space. I would
  recommend this product to anyone looking for value for their
  money</Text>
  <Text category="health">I called Nature Made and inquired about
  their procedures to test their product for mercury. Their Fish
  oil is USP tested for purity and potency. There isn't any
  "mercury-free" fish oil, however, NM contains only .01 mcg / g of
  mercury. Very low level and certainly not toxic. I'm keeping my
  bottle of it and will take it confidently. FYI: they have a great
  website that contains all this information</Text>
  <Text category="health">Doug Ritter and his foundation, Equipped
  to Survive, has come up with a very economic method to equip
  yourself and your family with an emergency kit. It is small
  enough to carry unnoticed in a pocket, yet fully functional.
  Although you can control the amount of certain items if you put
  together your own kit (something of a rite of passage among the
  survivalists/emergency preparedness folk), I spent twice as much
  putting together a comparable kit. The military issue sparklite
  and tinder-quick, Fox-40 whistle, and Rescue Flash signal mirror
  alone could cover the cost of the kit and they are all top notch
  gear. This pack is extremely high quality through and through,
  from choice of equipment to packing and instructions. I recommend
  looking at the ETS website at the slideshow of how such a kit is
  put together and what Doug Ritter himself recommends that you add
  to the kit (the pouch can hold a few more small items such as
  water purification tabs). The Pocket Survival Pack is an amazing
  value. I've purchased all of the items separately, and just the
  shipping or driving to pick up 3 or 4 of the items probably
  covers half the cost! If you are lucky enough to get everything
  at one store, you'd be hard pressed to get the entire kit as
  cheap as this. I know people who have purchased this kit to take
  the parts for their own self-built survival kits! That's how
  economical it is. Plus, if you buy this PSP, a portion of the
  proceeds goes to the ETS non-profit group which gives free
  survival consulting to deployed troops and is actively involved
  in improving survival equipment and standards. In fact, Doug
  Ritter is the only consumer advocate working with the governing
  body on personal locator beacons used in marine, aviation, and
  remote travel. The kit itself comes in a waterproof container. I
  found it to be a bit tight when closing back up, but there is
  actually some room for more items. All components are of the
  highest quality. It's lightweight and I never notice it in a
  pocket. With the recommended ETS or similar keychain LED
  flashlight and a good pocket folding knife, you have a complete
  survival kit that rivals ones costing $100+. These are cheap
  enough to get one for each car and any
  camping/hiking/marine/aviation gear you might have. I highly
  recommend this PSP. I'm not affiliated with ETS, but I've come to
  appreciate their no-nonsense advice and forums. And if this was a
  bad kit, I'd still say so. I give it 5 stars, great value for the
  price and it really could save your life</Text>
  <Text category="health">Bought this to help make muddy paw print
  clean up a little quicker. This works well, my better half thinks
  I have an obsession with Mr. Swiffer... :) It does leave a haze

  enough. Overall, I would purchase the Swiffer again if I had
  too</Text>
  <Text category="health">Clean, fresh, subtle scent; not at all

  <Text category="health">I bought Calvin Klein For Women parfum as

  <Text category="health">I love these LUVS! They are remarkably
  thin. Easy to pull out of the wipe warmer, yet still very durable
  and pliable. However, they are also remarkably difficult to find
  locally. So buy in bulk when you can find them.</Text>
  <Text category="health">These wipes are just as soft and durable

  unfortunately - though I have noticed that those wipes which are

  <Text category="health">I suffer from upper back and shoulder

  <Text category="health">I purchased the Revlon Facial Steamer,

  <Text category="health">I really like this product because it's
  compact and easy to use. Now that wouldn't be important if it
  didn't work properly, but it does, so I have everything in one
  small, easy-to-carry package. That's a valuable feature for one
  who's on the go as much as I am. The greatest thing about this
  product is that it's ACCURATE; I always take it to the Dr's
  office with me and compare his results with the results of this
  dynamite little monitor. I liked it so well, after I tried it, I
  went back and bought one for a friend who was recently diagnosed
  with high blood pressure. Highly recommended, but I also
  recommend that you compare your results with your doctor's. After
  all, it's only a machine ... and like cars, you can always get a

  <Text category="health">I have been using Source of Life Energy
  Shake for many years. I recommend one scoop in 8 oz. of orange
  juice or milk twice a day. Basically, I pour the milk in a shaker
  cup and put the scoop on top, close the shaker and shake for a
  few seconds. This stuff tastes great and has loads of healthy
  vitamins, herbs, minerals, and more! A few months ago, I actually
  used this drink to cut down on my Starbuck's daily double shot of
  expresso! Guess a Source of Life Starbucks Latte would be great,
  maybe I'll try that someday! This product deserves more than 5
  stars and it is absolutely a great product in every way. If you

  found it</Text>
  <Text category="health">My grandfather found a vial of Old Spice
  in his Navy kit when he joined in 1943. He continued using it
  after the war and my father picked it up when he himself came of

  Old Spice is conservative and masculine, distinct and

  <Text category="health">This is a great barber-style setup... it

  <Text category="health">I love this product. In combination with
  diet and exercise I have lost about 5 pounds, and I wasn't heavy
  to begin with (all I wanted to do was tone up). Instead of taking
  the recommended dosage of 2 capsules twice a day, I am taking 1
  twice a day. I figured I'd take it slow before I get too jittery.
  But it definitely curbs my appetite. I literally eat half of my
  usual intake. It gives me energy without making me feel like I'm
  wired and I haven't had any shaking hands. I only had headaches
  for the first 2 days I took this, but now they are completely
  gone. I will continue to take this even after I reach my goal

  <Text category="health">I rate (Green tea Fat Burner) 5 star.
  because I bot another called Lipoxinol 70.00) and I bot another
  one called (Green tea fat furner) and it was better in quality
  wise and its only 14.99 at Costco. Lipoxinol is very good as well
  but more expesive . bot off amazon.it sais its ( made canada)
  derctions say to take 4 pills in AM &amp;amp; 4pills PM. and man
  there great. the (green tea fat burners) in comparison dictions
  say take 2 pillsAM &amp;amp; 2pills PM. I over rall I think
  (green tea fat burner) makes me a little bit more hyper. the more
  hyper the more stuff I do ,that means the more excerise I
  get,,,,, You will see Lipoxinal on amazon. its 4 star, this one
  has less rating for some reason ,not many people said much about
  it, wierd ,Americans like to pay more money when ,this one can
  work just as great, not all work tho, but like I said this one
  was great for me in wise, I bot both,dont go off telling every
  one u are taking weight loss pills because people will get
  worryed, like theres no problem ,people drink Coffee every day of
  there life, I told my mom and she thot I was crazy, but what dose
  my mom know, she never tryed weight loss pills, I tryed ntoher
  one from the natral food store call Mini skiny fat burner and I
  felt like I just shot my self with cocane, so be carfull ,earbs
  have been used for thousand of years and can make u drug
  crazy,</Text>
  <Text category="health">This product does make the appetite
  disappear!! However it made me very irritable while I took it. I
  took it for four days so I did not give it enough time to see how
  the fat burning part worked. The pills were also very long and
  caused me throat irritation. Everyone is affected differently
  when taking things so I would say give it a try you will notice
  the effects right away.</Text>
  <Text category="health">IT'S AMAZING HOW A LITTLE COMMON SENSE
  CAN TURN INTO A MILLION YOU KNOW WHAT'S. AS SOON AS I TRIED THESE
  I REALIZED HOW MUCH BETTER THEY ARE THAN THE USUAL THROAT
  LOZENGES. WHY? BECAUSE OTHERS CAUSE YOU TO SUCK ON THEM, AND THIS
  STRAINS YOUR THROAT MUSCLES, WHICH IS BAD. GUMMI LOZENGES, IT'S
  GENIUS. WHY DIDN'T I THINK OF IT. THEN AGAIN, I DID, BUT I DIDN'T
  CREATE AIRBORNE WHICH IS WONDERFUL IN ITSELF. REALLY, THESE
  LOZENGERS ARE GREAT. AT NIGHT IF YOU USE ONE THEY JUST STAY
  PRETTY MUCH STUCK TO THE SIDE OF YOUR THROAT AND YOU CAN FALL
  ASLEEP WITHOUT EVEN THE THOUGHT THAT YOU COULD SHALLOW IT AND
  CHOKE. JUST REMEMBER HOW LONG IT TAKES FOR A NORMAL LOZENGE TO
  DISOLVE WITHOUT BITTING IT ( EVEN THEN ). THESE GO PRETTY QUICK,
  AND WITHOUT CREWING ( WHICH IS THE BEST WAY TO USE THEM ). I
  MYSELF TRY TO ALWAYS HAVE THEM IN THE HOUSE. YOU SHOULD, AND WILL
  DO THE SAME AFTER YOU TRY THEM. ALSO THE PRICE ON AMAZON IS THE
  BEST. I'M ABOUT TO ORDER 10 BOXES ( WOULD ORDER MORE BUT FOR THE
  SHIPPING CHARGE, WHICH EVEN WITH IS STILL CHEAPER THEN TARGET ).
  MAYBE THE OWNER SHOULD PUT ME ON THE PAYROLL.</Text>
  <Text category="health">27 ounces is a nice size, the bottle is
  light (can be dented), and water stored in it tastes very
  good....and that will be even more welcome in the summer when a
  hot plastic water bottle in the car will taste lousy! Another
  reviewer mentioned a squeal......that would be while twisting the
  cap on or off. I've gotten used to that. Wish it was just a hair
  thinner to fit in my Toyota cupholder...that may not be an issue
  with Toyotas that are newer than mine are (10 &amp;amp; 15years).

  <Text category="health">We love this new power toothbrush because
  it does a great job cleaning the teeth and it has so much more
  power than our old brush</Text>
  <Text category="health">I purchased this toothbrush for my 2
  young daughters. It's a great brush head for pediatric (and
  adult) mouths. They swap out the heads, it's rechargeable and I
  can stop purchasing junky kids battery-operated toothbrushes
  every 1-2 months after the batteries wear down. I have used this
  toothbrush for myself for the past 3 years and no longer have a
  problem with receding gums or plaque build-up</Text>
  <Text category="health">I used to own a brush from another
  manufacturer. It never brushed well: the heads wore out
  waaaaaaaay too quickly. I just never felt I was getting a good
  brush. After using this brush for about a couple of months, I
  went in for a regular checkup. My dentist told me my teeth had
  never looked better. That's all the testimony I need</Text>
  <Text category="health">I like the 4 brush holder and the power
  and brushing action of this model. The kids find the 30 second
  interval timer especially helpful to keep moving around the
  mouth. It's a bit louder than the older model, probably because
  it's got an additional motion, and the blue charging light is
  bright enough for a night light. Overall, just what we
  wanted</Text>
  <Text category="health">Daughter was very pleased when she
  received it unexpectedly, after her good news! She's very picky
  also...just loved the quality and organizational value of the
  set! Very nicely packaged. Would highly recommend</Text>
  <Text category="health">I was skeptical about buying this at
  first, but after seeing it in Allure, and reading the various
  reviews on amazon, I decided to try it. I have to say, I was
  pleasantly surprised; it does what it says. It won't work on
  cyctic acne or if the pimple has already come to a head. It does
  work on pimples that are just beginning.. those hard, tender
  knots deep under your skin you just know are going to be huge in
  a day or two. I've used it on two pimples that were red bumps,
  and both were mostly gone within 24 hours. Completely gone in
  less than 3 days. Usually it would have taken 7-10 days for them
  to go away, and it would have been UGLY</Text>
  <Text category="health">i love this product...it is so well worth
  the money if you're experiencing a skin problem. easy to use,
  portable, no lotions or creams needed...just my little leather
  case</Text>
  <Text category="health">Heats up fast, rolls up easily (doesn't
  slip like old-school hot rollers used to), and stays on with the
  right hot roller clips. Depending on the look I'm looking for, I
  use 4 or up to 8 rollers for my chin-length fine hair, keep them
  on for 10 minutes while I put on my makeup, and voila! Soft,
  strokeable voluminous hair</Text>
  <Text category="health">I use these almost every morning. They're
  hot and ready to go in seconds. I like the nonslip surface of the
  curlers. Makes it so easy to set my hair, remove, and go in a
  matter of minutes and still have a really nice style. I like
  having 12 *large* rollers to handle my thick, long hair. These
  rollers rock</Text>
  <Text category="health">The lisse crepe microfiber hair turbans
  from aquis are very soft, absorbant, and they dry quickly. The
  "diva darling" hair towels are not quite as nice. Hair turbans
  stay neatly on your head and are more convenient than a big
  fluffy towel. If the turban gets sopping wet, that means it's
  doing its job! My parents taught me it's impolite to come to
  breakfast without a towel covering my wet hair. This turban is
  not only great at home, but also in college dorms.</Text>
  <Text category="health">This product works well, it takes a while
  to warm up but it can keep my feet nice and warm once it gets
  going.</Text>
  <Text category="health">Always saw them at the mall and wanted
  one, it was nice to be able to get it on here and not have to
  search, works great! feels wonderful!!! especially when you get
  that headache!!!, also doubles as a contemporary hat!! haha, love
  it</Text>
  <Text category="health">I love The Tingler! Each metal tip feels
  great. I personally like the COPPER version a little better than
  the SILVER version. It's a little gentler and softer but I know
  some people find it too soft and like the SILVER version instead.
  Before the tingler, sometimes I would use one end of my glasses
  (the end that fits over the ear) but of course my glasses are
  fragil and I would risk damaging them. It also feels really good
  on the back and actually all over, not just on the head</Text>
  <Text category="health">I am totally satisfied with thids product
  so far. Of course if the batteries run out of charge after a few
  charges I will be dissatisfied. I expect them to last tens of
  reusses if experience can be of any guideline</Text>
  <Text category="health">Great aerobic exerciser for the money and
  very lightweight. Let cool down after using as metal does get a
  bit hot. The plastic leg stoppers do stink a bit, yet the plastic
  will off-gas. Works best on couch while watching TV/Movies. For
  anyone who is disabled or uninspired to work out, I highly
  recommend this to help get you back into shape</Text>
  <Text category="health">I have fought with my naturally curly
  crazy hair for all of my life..I have tried more products that I

  out of the shower, towel dry very lightly, put it on and voila!
  Makes my curls looks sexy!</Text>
  <Text category="health">I love this product. Its the first one
  I've found where I can practically have wash and go curly hair.
  Just put work it through damp hair and let it air dry or twist
  around fingers for defined curls</Text>
  <Text category="health">I'm sixty years old and I have been using
  this product for years. When I had my yearly physical the Doc ask
  me if I used anything because my skin looks so good. RoC

  <Text category="health">clothes are soft and smell great works
  just as good as any fabric softener out there and better for you,
  your family, and the enviroment</Text>
  <Text category="health">I just got my first case of this fabric
  softener last week and yesterday, I was walking downstairs when
  the smell of lavender hit me - I was surprised because I hadn't
  sprayed any lavender freshener in the air, when I realized that
  my boyfriend was doing a load of laundry. Like Seventh
  Generation's lavender laundry detergent, I love this product - if
  you use them in tandem, not only do your clothes smell like
  *real* lavender (not the chemically-based smells of mainstream
  products), but they come out clean and soft. I especially like
  the lavender smell for my sheets and blankets and it's gentle
  enough to use on my baby's clothes, too! I love that it's made
  with natural products and real lavender essential oil. It's also
  safe for my septic system, so I'm sold on this product. If you're
  sensitive to the chemical-based scents of the mainstream fabric
  softeners or can't find one that smells good to you, try this
  one!</Text>
  <Text category="health">This replaced a similar wrist cuff meter
  which I was not happy with. The old meter would give very
  different readings on measurements made minutes apart. This meter
  yields essentially the same numbers for second measurements. Out
  of curiosity, I took it with me to my doctors office, used his
  large cuff (I have very large arms) and compared the readings to
  his equipment. Total difference was about 3%, a quite acceptable
  tolerance for my home measurement. Another reviewer was unhappy
  with the screen size and position on the bottom of the wrist. If
  the unit is operated as shown in the instructions, the screen
  size and position are perfect, the unit is at heart level, and is
  quite easy to read. Overall, for home use and serious data
  collection and blood pressure monitoring, I like this
  device</Text>
  <Text category="health">I love the this set ,expecially the nail
  cutter, I,m still using mine after six years</Text>
  <Text category="health">I saw these here and ordered two pair to
  get the free shipping deal. I should get a deal where I get a cut
  of the customers I send them because EVERY day I have my
  customers (several each day) ask me what's going on with my
  glasses and where did I get them. I used to go through several
  pair of reading glasses a month. Now I have had these two pair
  for ...gosh, It's got to be close to a year now! They don't
  scratch, break, get lost, they're always right there. I don't
  know how I did with out them for so long. Get a couple of pairs
  you'll love them. Oh, one thing when the ladies try them on thier
  hair doesn't always set right with the wrap around thingy. But I
  don't know that this can't be overcome....so...something to
  consider</Text>
  <Text category="health">I have been using this attachment to my
  waterpik for gum disease for five years----it directs the
  medicine into the gum pockets easily and helps save me from
  really big bills at the periodontist. It works for me, but needs
  to be used in conjunction with regular flossing, brushing, and
  generally good tooth care.</Text>
  <Text category="health">I love this. Everyone can have their own
  data and we can track our own progress. It is very simple to use
  and the explanations are clear</Text>
  <Text category="health">Great enginering, design and
  craftmanship; works great every day; but I had to throw away a
  travel size "Waterpick" after 18 months, because it is impossible
  to obtain a replacement hose assembly from the manufacturer or
  anywhere else. It doesn't make any sense to supply an
  irreplaceable disposable part, on an equipment designed to
  outlast it three times</Text>
  <Text category="health">I use it for the water pic function in
  addition to the sinus rinse tool I purchased. Works great!</Text>
  <Text category="health">This simple scale is light, easy to carry
  and store. I tested it thoroughly when it arrived against my
  older dial scale. It read the same weight, but actually with less
  flucuation when I shifted on it. I was careful to keep it on a
  flat surface... I had good luck on old hardwood floors, less luck
  on our old bumpy tile floors in the bathroom. It was very
  consistent on a level surface... I tested it several times in a
  row with the same reading, and various times throughout the
  day... nothing read unusually. I really like the form factor of
  this scale. It's so small... Not small spacewise, but just thin,
  light, with a nice solid place to plant your feet</Text>
  <Text category="health">I'am very satisfied with the Vidal
  Sassoon hairdryer. There are 3 heat settings and tips in the
  enclosed booklet on how to use these settings. It is a little
  bulky but it doesn't take long to get used to a larger dryer. I
  would recommend this hair dyer</Text>
  <Text category="health">good shaver lots of battery life quick
  charge lots of trim setting and gives a good uniform cu</Text>
  <Text category="health">I bought this for my boyfriend and he
  uses it for his facial hair and to shave his head. Its very easy
  to clean and does a great job</Text>
  <Text category="health">Very nice trimmer. My hat off to
  Remington. I have been using this trimmer on both my hair and
  beard. It words perfectly and is much better than changing
  spacers</Text>
  <Text category="health">This is the best and easiest to use back
  brush! I have trouble reaching my back and washclothes just
  didn't do it but with this brush no more missed spots. Just hang
  it up and it dries and is ready for the next time. Never felt so
  clean</Text>
  <Text category="health">I rate this piece of equipment as 4 stars
  because I have not used it enough to know if it does everything
  it claims....however I have been amazed at how this little
  contraption does wonders on my back. When I first got this lumbar
  extender I set up up in about 2 seconds and then stretched
  backwards to lay on it. OMG, as I laid down it was like I
  couldn't even breath for a brief second. To actually feel my back
  being forced into shape nearly took my breath away as all the
  muscles were pushed around. I had to relax and it was amazing how
  sore the muscles in my back were from leaning over my computer at
  work. Having used it for about a month now, my back has started
  to feel much better and I am sleeping better too</Text>
  <Text category="health">For two years I suffered with four
  herniated discs. Physical therapy, a spinal injection ,
  chiropractic adjustments, and many sessions on a spinal
  decompression machine provided short term relief. I started using
  the McKenzie Method extension exercises, and this offered the
  most relief. Fortunately, I finally discovered the Lumbar
  Extender in an internet ad. I noticed that it placed the spine in
  a similar position as the McKenzie exercises. So, I decided to
  order the Lumbar Extender to determine if it would provide better
  relief than all the other methods I was using. The first two
  weeks that I used the Lumbar Extender, I had some minor
  discomfort. Now after five weeks using the Lumbar Extender, I can
  honestly say that my back has not felt better in two years. This
  device does all that it says it will do. I actually enjoy lying
  on it for two seven-minute sessions each day-one session in the
  morning and one session at night. When I first used the device, I
  heard snapping noises in my lower back, probably the spinal
  facets being repositioned, and then I would experience immediate
  relief. Now I feel as if I have better posture and better
  curvature to my lumbar region. The cost of the Lumbar Extender is
  low compared to a visit to a doctor, and it is worth trying. I
  highly recommend it</Text>
  <Text category="health">Since having back problems, especially
  waking up in the morning, this Lumbar Extender works wonders for
  my back. I can easily have a good start for the day from now on!!
  Many thanks. B</Text>
  <Text category="health">THE BAD NEWS FIRST: DOESN'T SEEM TO WORK
  WELL WITHOUT ADDING EXTRA DETERGENT It seems like this is NOT 3x
  concentration, and like others we found we had to compensate by
  adding more detergent than the directions said to get the same
  results as we did with the standard formula. Otherwise, the two
  products, 'concentrated' and 'standard srength' are the same.
  MAKE NO MISTAKE ABOUT IT - THIS IS CONCENTRATED &amp;amp; COMES
  OUT LIKE HEINZ KETCHUP: It does seem to be concentrated, and we
  did notice a certain amount of difficulty getting the detergent
  out of the bottle, kind of reminded us of Heinz ketchup. 4-STAR
  or 5-STAR PRODUCT? The standard strength product is clearly a
  5-STAR product, however owing to the fact that this product does
  not work as well without adding more detergent than the direction
  claim, it rates 4-STARs with our family. TRYING TO LEARN
  OBJECTIVE INFO ON LAUNDRY DETERGENT IS WELL . . . . THE FOLLOWING
  IS TRUE OF THIS PRODUCT IN STANDARD STRENGTH or 3X WITH EXTRA
  DETERGENT ADDED: I am allergic to most laundry detergents, but
  this product has prevented severe discomfort for me for about 10
  years. It is consistently among the lowest-priced detergents
  available. In addition to being very easy on clothes and skin, it
  does work quite well in the stain-removal department and can be
  used as its own presoak. This is good to know if you are like me
  and are trying to avoid allergens. It is important to remember
  that if you buy a hypoallergenic powder detergent instead of a
  liquid like this, you may have to pre-soak stains and you won't
  have a hypoallergenic liquid with which to do it. While "Tide"
  and "Cheer" are also available in hypoallergenic formulas,["Tide
  Free" is actually just unscented] they are considerably more
  expensive and work no better in my experience. That's why I like
  this "All Liquid Detergent - Free Clear, Laundry Detergent".
  OBJECTIVE INFORMATION IS TOUGH TO FIND! I actually did conduct a
  hard target search for true, objective information on laundry
  detergents. There is very little beyond which brand causes
  pollution which, while important, is not what I was trying to
  find. "Consumer Reports" does have test comparisons of the most
  popular brands in its monthly magazine every couple of years and
  they do include some detail. ABOUT "ALL'S WEBSITE" If you are
  looking for this product's website it is under "Unilever" and you
  will have to specify "USA" under products, as the word "ALL" will
  show up in almost every search result. You will find "WISK" and
  "BREYER'S ICE CREAM" and almost as many neat name brand products
  as you would at Procter and Gamble's site. [I AM NOT AFFILIATED
  WITH ANY PRODUCT OR COMPANY]</Text>
  <Text category="health">It is not one of the stain removers ,
  which instantly gets rid of the stain. So when you spill over
  something over your t-shirt, you got to spill this TIDE STAIN
  REMOVER on it as well so it does make sure that your cloth
  wouldnt be clogged with STAIN but its not an immedieate relief
  solution</Text>
  <Text category="health">I was 5 minutes early getting out of the
  house to go to work one morning so I decided I could stop by a
  coffee shop and get a mocha. On my way back to my car the mocha
  "splooshed" out of the sipping hole in the to-go lid and got all
  over my sweater...naturally, that day it was a white silk knit
  sweater. So I had these large dark brown coffee/chocolate stains,
  and a decision to make about whether to make myself extremely
  late to work by going home to change. The cafe was next to a
  supermarket so I decided to go buy a Tide to Go pen and give it a
  try. I applied it as directed to the stain and immediately the
  stain lightened noticeably. I was a bit worried because after
  treatment there were still light tan stains visible, but after
  blotting the excess liquid and letting the sweater dry while
  wearing for about half an hour, there was no hint that any mocha
  had ever touched my sweater. The cleansing agent also gets points
  for not damaging my silk sweater, despite the fact I was rubbing
  the product in fairly vigorously (out of desperation...I was
  going to be late for work!) I'm not sure how it would work on
  other stains but I will keep one in my purse from now on. On the
  packaging it does identify which sorts of stains it works best
  on, and which it will be less effective on. From other reviews
  this will not work so well on some common food stains, so that's
  why I'm giving 4 stars and not 5. Another minor concern is the
  warning about blotting the fluid if fabric will come into contact
  with direct sunlight. It doesn't say what will happen if you
  allow saturated fabric to see sunlight. Perhaps there is the
  potential for color/fabric damage</Text>
  <Text category="health">I can say before I started to use this
  product I was always afraid of wearing white clothings but Tide
  to Go has totally changed everything. Initially I thought this
  was just a gimmick but I thought it was worth a try,...soo...I
  bought it with me during our two-week trip with my parents in
  August..and it came handy...My dad bought a brand new white
  jacket and had it put on immediately and then decided to drink a
  cup of coffee..unfortunately, he spilled the coffee on the white
  jacket when he tried to open the lid to put sugar in it...my
  mother immediately wiped the coffee off with napkins..the coffee
  stain, however, was still there...Then..I remember I had put a
  Tide-to-Go in my purse...I immediately used it on all coffee
  stains on the white jacket...and to my surpise, all the brown
  spots resulted from the coffee spill were GONE...amazing..I have
  used this on different kind of food stains. I've used it on
  Coffee stain, spaghetti sauce stain, juice stain and they all
  worked. My mother, my mother-in-law, and my sister-in law they
  were all so amazed at the result that they all asked me for one
  to carry with them. Nowadays I don't leave home without one in my
  purse..I used to be afraid of wearing white clothings, I am no
  longer afraid of wearing whites because of Tide-to-Go..this is
  definitely a useful product to carry with you everywhere you
  go..oh..as far as the smell goes..The smell is bearable to
  me...and in order to use it you have to push it down to get the
  actual fluid to flow out through the tip of the Tide-to-Go
  marker.</Text>
  <Text category="health">This product is so good for you. I
  sprinkle it on my cereal, salads, in yogurt, etx. A nice nutty
  flavor. And the health benefits are outstanding. I highly
  recommend this product</Text>
  <Text category="health">The Satinelle Ice Epilator does exactly
  what it is supposed to do: remove hair quickly and efficiently by
  the root. What an advantage! Hair does not reappear as quickly as
  it does shaving, and when it does, it is not the sharp stubble
  that happens with shaving. I don't think it hurts much, though
  some spots may be a bit more sensitive than others. The trick
  then is to simply lift it up off of the skin and stop
  momentarily. I am very happy with this product</Text>
  <Text category="health">I boutght this razor for my husband. He
  likes it, but notes that it is hard to clean and does not get the
  longer whiskers, which he seems to miss a lot. I think that if he
  shaved more carefully, he would get these whiskers before they
  get too long! I think that for the price (lower end of price
  range), it does a pretty good job. Next time, I'll buy him a more
  expensive one and hope that it performs better.</Text>
  <Text category="health">This stuff is AWESOME for hangovers. It
  was like my high school staple! I mean, I went through like a box
  a week. At least give it a try</Text>
  <Text category="health">My husband tried this after I bought it
  and he loves it. It is a great remedy for a hangover or even just
  a bad morning. It is very hard to find in most drugstores. Now I
  just buy it on the internet. I've even recommended it to friends
  who now swear buy it</Text>
  <Text category="health">I love this product! I deal with a lot of
  stress (dont' we all) and was feeling edgy and nervous all the
  time. I couldnt' even enjoy my grandkids. Since I started taking
  Calm Advantage those feelings are gone and I can relax and enjoy
  life again. I would definately recommend it to anyone</Text>
  <Text category="health">Bought this for my husband who has a 2
  hour (one way) commute by bus to work. He loves it. Now he can
  nap without waking up with a cramp in his neck. It is very
  portable, with a small carrying case and is easy to blow-up. A
  bargain for the price</Text>
  <Text category="health">This is a great iron for a starter, but
  will not do it like a stylist. I have had it for at least 2 years
  so it will last also. The price is a little bit to high I only
  paid $ 19.99 for it at Walmart.I know everyone has gotten used to
  shopping online because it is eay and always open, but I have to
  tell you that most of the things I have found on amazon are
  priced way to high. They used to be a great spot to get good
  stuff cheap but that is no longer true. I think it just kind of
  creeped up on us without us noticing what was going on. Please
  folks go back out in to the world and start looking you will see
  that I am not wrong</Text>
  <Text category="health">I have not try Proactive. The thought of
  buying something from an infomercial just doesn't sit well with
  me. I, however, have tried many many products since my 20s till
  now (I'm 35). I spent thousands of dollars on expense department
  store's brands like Clarins, Seshiedo, Dior, Clinics, Chanel, and
  Prescriptives. I've also religiously go to my derma every three
  weeks for the past ten years to have facials, extractions, and
  chemical peels. I tried perscription cream, oitments, pads, you
  name it (even thought of laser). I have mild acne problem year
  round, and it only gets worst during that time of the month
  (that's when I'd run out and try new products). Three days ago I
  bought the Zeno. I'm going to return it. It did nothing to me
  accept thought it would burn me. I also bought AcneFree and today
  I went back and bought another package to put in my gym bag.
  Three days now, I've noticed my skin cleared up! I'm amazed. I'm
  not giving it a 5 star because my skin is not completely cleared.
  I'll give it a try two more weeks and will update my rating if it
  improve. So far AcneFree works for me</Text>
  <Text category="health">Great product, the girls had a blast with
  it. Real easy to use and real easy to put the gems back in the
  jeweler once you take them out of your hair. Great fun for girls
  who enjoy dressing up and getting bedazzled! Although it kinds of
  pulls a piece of hair or two out when you try and slide them out
  of your hair. Not all the time though. Still a fabulous product.
  Would highly recommend it. My niece wishes it came with more
  gems</Text>
  <Text category="health">This is great-my daughter looks for
  reasons to use and wear the quick gems</Text>
  <Text category="health">These items are neat little towelettes
  that come in their own attractive and useful plastic container.
  They are very handy, and work wonders for insuring cleanliness.
  Personally, I sure wish I had had these when my first two
  children were small. On the down side, flushing these things
  *can* result in plumbing problems, as I experienced. Apparently,
  if your sewer line is relatively new and clear, they should give
  you no problems. But, if your system has any place in it where
  things can collect, you will face problems. According to my
  plumber, toilet paper begins to break down quite quickly, but
  these towelettes can take over a month to do so. (My house was
  built in 1916!) So, overall, I do like this product, and I
  recommend it. I just recommend that if you live in an older
  house, that you do not flush them</Text>
  <Text category="health">My hair gets weighed down very easily by
  finishing/smoothing products -- they will leave my hair looking
  flat and greasy instead of smooth. My hair is very fine, but also
  thick (which is very annoying). This finishing solution leaves my
  hair very smooth without weighing it down. It seems very
  expensive for such a small bottle, but a little goes a long way
  (I've had the same bottle for nearly a year and it's still not
  finished). Definitely spritz it into your hands and not directly
  into your hair because it does not disperse at all. The scent is
  very light and refreshing and not at all overwhelming.</Text>
  <Text category="health">Shaving cream in a tube is just about
  impossible to buy at retail outlets. This is a great product and
  I will continue to buy it through Amazon</Text>
  <Text category="health">There is no better shaving cream. I am

  <Text category="health">It doesnt quit dark circles, but helps
  against wrinkles while it is on your face</Text>
  <Text category="health">i tried all the possible creams on the
  market, cheap and expensive, for my dark circles but this is the
  only one that worked imediately. i cannot live without it, this
  is a keeper. it stings a little bit, not all the time but it
  does. it says that it should only be used twice a day but if i've
  had a really tiring week and i'm in a rush to look good i use it
  up to five six times a day, just a tiny film and with 2 hours
  between them. i guarantee that in three days you'll not recognize
  yourself(in a good way). very important: it tends to dry the skin
  under the eyes very much so be sure to aplly after a very good
  cream( i use pure chamomile cream)and leave it over night. well,
  follow my recipe and you'll shine fast, you'll see</Text>

  <Text category="health">I ordered these disposable pampers for my

  shipping</Text>
  <Text category="health">These are by far the BEST newborn size
  diapers especially for small babies, but if you order them
  through Amazon, your baby may outgrow them before they even

  <Text category="health">I lost six pounds in eleven days. I

  have a lot more energy and am motivated to exercise. No side
  effects whatsoever. My problem was the munchies at night watching
  TV -- and that craving is gone. I highly recommend this
  product</Text>
  <Text category="health">Read the reviews and picked the elephant
  for my 17m old child's nusery. I absolutely love it. Before this,
  my son could not sleep well with our "family's" humiifier because
  it was too noisy. Within an hour of bringing this home, it was
  set up (very easily) and he took one of many 2 1/2 hour naps that
  week! No filters, No noise, NO PROBLEMS thus far! I did have it
  on high for the first 20 mins and found a puddle of water
  underneath, but the humidifier was near a window, and i am
  asumming there was a draft that may have directed the steam
  toward the dresser top. (The problem was resolved once moved unto
  a different surfacetop) Filling it is a snap and the very fine
  mist (looked like small stream of fog) was a pleasure to see out
  of the trunk of the animal! The tank seems to last longer than
  the box states. It is on it's third day on a low/med setting and
  it still only has a 3 inch difference at the top. I love the
  safety features and I don't have to worry about the tank still on
  if it's empty since it has an automatic shut off! The light is
  not a problem since he likes to have a tiny bit of light in his
  room. It is a design that will last thoughout his childhood!

  <Text category="health">It seems to be doing the job....my next
  dental check will tell. It's a little awkward at first getting
  used to the brush (quite a bit different from the conventional
  brush); and I think though they tell you to hold the handle with
  two fingers only (thumb and forefinger) that you do have to tilt
  the brush a little to get the gumline. And I still do find a
  little tartar on my teeth. So, you decide</Text>
  <Text category="health">great tooth brush.my dentist said my gums
  and teeth have never looked bette</Text>
  <Text category="health">It takes some getting used to, but once
  you do you will love it. It leaves my teeth cleaner than any
  toothbrush, electric or other, that I have ever used. You feel at
  first like it is totally strange (it is!). Doesn't take more than
  a few times using it to realize that it's a great concept and so
  much faster than anything else. I have no buyers remorse. I Just
  wish that changing the brushes on it were simpler so one brush
  could be shared with another person. You really are best to have
  one per person with this one since changing the brush a lot is a
  hassle</Text>
  <Text category="health">I bought one of these to squeege the

  <Text category="health">I got this for my daughter for Christmas.
  She loves it. She is able to do her nail easily. The nail

  <Text category="health">I purchased this for my husband. He hates
  to shave everyday and now he can without the razor burn. It is
  even as close a shave as if he used a razor! I saw it on the
  Consumers Number One pick for foil shavers and I am glad I went
  with their reccomendation</Text>
  <Text category="health">I bought this razor over a year ago, and
  I wouldn't trade it in for any other razor out there. It really
  does leave your skin super smooth. I love the triple blades on it
  so I know I can get a close, comfortable shave, even in hard to
  reach places. Thanks to the pivoting head, it moves with the
  curves of your legs without the worries of getting cut. It's also
  excellent for shaving the underarm area. I find that one stroke
  is all it takes, and you have a smooth appearance you have to
  feel and see to believe. This is truly a remarkable product for
  the women out there who are tired of shaving every other day, or
  more than three times a week. With this razor, it shaves so close
  to the hair follicle, you will be shaving in less time, less
  often. I will never part with my Venus razor. The best part is -
  it's a bargain for what you get!</Text>

  <Text category="health">Best hair dryer ever. I have long, thick,
  curly, frizzy hair and after just drying my hair for less then 10
  minutes with the Conair 213X, my hair is shiny and soft. The
  diffuser is also amazing; I can wear my hair naturally without
  any frizz. By far the best dryer out there in this price range.
  Granted, it's heavy, but it cuts my drying time in half and I
  don't have to style after drying which is another plus! It has a
  warm heat setting which is awesome and what could make it
  prettier than the Rhinestones?</Text>
  <Text category="health">I purchased this hairdryer after my
  professional Conair Yellowbird from the late 70's broke. I
  definitely wanted another Conair and I wanted to move into the
  21st Century! I did the research and this hairdryer had the most
  features for the best price. I wasn't disappointed. As the other
  reviewers have stated, this hairdryer dries your hair in half the
  time! It's also nice to reduce the static in your hair when you
  want to freshen up and are "dry brushing" your hair. It does draw
  a lot of power when on high heat and the highest blowing setting
  and the lights in my dressing room will dim. Otherwise, it is
  very solidly built and I hope to have this hairdryer for another
  30 years.</Text>

  it's the anti-humectant that I like, not the humectant. The

  it on occasion by mistake. This stuff smells great too! Makes
  styling a snap</Text>
  <Text category="health">I am very happy with the Emjoi Compact
  Epilator that I purchased. It does exactly what it claims to do
  and works wonderfully. Until I asked a salon for advice on the
  best way to remove unwanted facial hair, I didn't even know
  something like this exhisted. I just wish I would have known
  about this product years ago. A. Davis</Text>
  <Text category="health">Very classy scent. Very strong. Spray
  sparingly, a little goes a long way. Lasts all day. Will receive
  many compliments</Text>
  <Text category="health">I purchased this for my wife for
  Christmas and she loves it...as do I. It isn't too 'perfume-y'
  and smells terrific</Text>

  perfectly... The flosser at the bottom the head of the toothbrush

  <Text category="health">I use this with my m3 turbo and some
  Kiehl's Closeshavers Squadron Ultimate Brushless Shave Cream

  <Text category="health">I got this for my husband for Christmas.
  I had seen it in magazines but it was expensive for this product,
  I thought. I was so excited to find it on Amazon and he just
  LOVES it. He shaves in the shower and the mirror never fogs. It's
  a great product</Text>
  <Text category="health">I looked long and hard for a heating pad
  that did not need plugging in or hot water poured into it. This
  is perfect - just zap it for two minutes in the microwave and set
  it where the you need it...ahhhh! Pure happiness! A definite must

  <Text category="health">I like this cutter. I can use it by
  itself or with its accessaries. Even when the batteries are low I
  can still nip those little overnight hairs. Works for me!</Text>
  <Text category="health">Easy to use. Short time to recharge the
  baterie. Long life batery and it is appropriate o sensitive

  <Text category="health">This booster cushion that you fill with
  water works very well in the spa. It is comfortable to sit on and
  saves wear on bathing suits. You need to put in in the spa while
  it is heating otherwise it is cold to sit on. It is a good
  product.</Text>
  <Text category="health">I've been using Nicads for long, long
  time and while in some applications the alkaline might last
  somewhat longer... the money saved after just a couple of
  recharges is worth the extra expense of buying twice as many as
  one needs and just keep on recycling the batteries from flash
  units, GPS, walkie-talkie's, flashlights, etc. HOWEVER, these
  newer NiMH are just great. no memory shelf and longer current
  life. NiCADS and ALkaline 4 stars these do get a</Text>
  <Text category="health">These batteries work well. They don't

  <Text category="health">what a sinfully awsome tasting way to get

  <Text category="health">I was looking for a towel that would dry
  me quickly and this towel did just that. It also dried completly
  by the next time I needed to use it. I would recommend it to
  anyone looking to get out of the bathroom faster. It is not soft
  and cozy but it does the job</Text>
  <Text category="health">I bought this for my aged Mom after she
  confessed that the big plush expensive terry towel I'd bought her
  was just too heavy for her to handle. She *adores* the microfiber
  towels I got her! They are light for her weak arms, they are so
  very absorbent that one or two passes gets her dry and that's
  particularly important with the delicate skin of the elderly. Not
  to mention that I, a hearty creature in my prime, love these
  towels too! I shall be buying more of various styles and
  colors</Text>
  <Text category="health">Just as it advertised, it is soft and
  dries up hair and body quickly. I bought it because it was on
  sale and thought why not try it out, well, I am sold on this
  product. Only drawback now is the high price tag..</Text>
  <Text category="health">I love this item. I received it as a gift
  and now use it every single day. My hair dries so much faster
  after having been wrapped up in this. That's great b/c now I do
  not have to blow dry as much, so my hair seems to be getting a
  lot healthier. Only complaint would be that it does not stay
  wrapped very well. Not sure if it's the material or the size, but
  nonetheless, it still works great.</Text>
  <Text category="health">I got this unit as a gift from my
  boyfriend. High blood pressure runs in my family so I wanted to
  get a monitor to keep track. I was figuring on getting an arm
  unit, but when I got this wrist unit I wanted to see how it would
  work. The whole system is very easy to use and fast. You need to
  be sitting and resting to take the reading, but is happens
  quickly and then it stores all the results for you. I didn't
  think I would really use the memory function but it has come in
  pretty handy. I can say this was a great gift, something I use a
  lot, and something that will help me stay healthy</Text>
  <Text category="health">I purchased this for use in my bathtub.
  It is more comfortable than the blow-up ones and stays
  cleaner.</Text>
  <Text category="health">I used to have some Remington shaver that
  a friend bought me for the last 5 yrs. It wasn't bad, but
  sometimes it irritated the skin. my first shaver was my dad's old
  school norelco shaver so i thought i'd give them a try again. the
  first one i got from amazon was $40 (i forgot the model #) and
  ended up sending it back to norelco for their 60 day guarantee.
  it was just alright. this one i feel about the same way. i mean
  it shaves decently, but as an asian male with not much facial
  hair, i still see that i have to shave every couple days which i
  prefer not to. the cleaning system is cool, and the fact that
  this shaver is so easy to clean (it says you can open it up and
  run it under water which i've been doing to clean it) make it
  worthwhile to me though. the battery life is also good. if there
  was a half star system, i'd give this shaver a 4.5/5</Text>
  <Text category="health">I have been using this shaver for 2 weeks
  now and have not had any problems with it. It is easy to use and
  clean I have only had to charge it once so far. Even though this
  is my first electric shaver, it is a good deal for the money. It
  doesn't shave as close as a razor but it's close. I would
  recommend it or give it as a gift.</Text>
  <Text category="health">My husband is in love with this razor! He
  thought he was a Norelco-only fan, until I bought him this model
  for Christmas. I purchased it due to the great reviews it
  received, both from consumers and independent reviewers, and also
  b/c it cost less than $40. It leaves his face so smooth, whether
  he shaves daily or skips a couple of days. In fact, he can
  finally shave the hairs on his upper neck without getting razor
  burn. Highly recommended</Text>
  <Text category="health">My wife and I both love this. In our
  opinion the thicker plastic tines offer a more comfortable and
  pleasurable "head trip" than the trippers one might find in the
  mall. The vibrations make it better than the non-vibrating head
  trippers but are not overwhelming. Another benefit of this
  particular device is that it is able to be completely
  disassembled and packed to be taken with you on travelsor on
  vacations. It's a pretty simple device, sold at a reasonable
  cost, and in my opinion is a better implementation than the metal
  ones</Text>
  <Text category="health">ALso bought as a gift but I tried it!
  Very relaxing and much more affordable than the ones you see in
  the mall</Text>
  <Text category="health">A very gentle undereye cream. I have used
  other name brands which extensively irritated my eyes and made
  them tear all the time. This one is definitely a keeper</Text>
  <Text category="health">It is a great product and makes my
  husband's face as smooth as a baby's you
  know............................</Text>
  <Text category="health">Tastes better than most candy bars and
  has no refined sugar or artificial ingredients</Text>
  <Text category="health">Very good; very satisfying. Interesting
  blend of flavors--dried fruit, cocoa, chili. Nothing dominates -
  all the flavors are well balanced to make it interesting to eat.
  I couldn't eat one every day, but for an occasional meal
  replacement, it is very good. Too high calorie to be a snack
  item, but it's tempting</Text>
  <Text category="health">I AM VERY PLEASED WITH THE LIGHT OUTPUT.
  I PURCHASED THEM TO LIGHT THE INSIDE OF MY CHILDS PLAYHOUSE. THEY
  REALLY ILUMINATE THE INSIDE AS BRIGHT AS A STANDARD LIGHT BULB. I
  PURCHASED A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO AN EARLIER TYPE LANTURN BY
  RAYOVAC AND WAS REALLY PLEASED WITH IT ALSO.</Text>
  <Text category="health">I've tried all kinds of bibs, but nothing
  works better than Pampers Bibsters. Right size, great pocket to

  <Text category="health">I have been using Kiss My Face olive oil
  soap for years, and I won't let any other soap touch my face! I
  found it when I was searching for a soap that wouldn't make my
  skin itch all over after a shower. I can tell you that after
  years and years, my sensitive skin has never once itched after I
  used KMF! The soap is mild, with a neutral scent, which is a big
  plus. It cleans great, but doesn't leave my skin dried out. The 8
  ounce bars are a bit large, but worth the wait until they shrink
  down to a size that's easier for us smaller-hands people</Text>
  <Text category="health">I recieved my product in a reasonable
  amount of time and I am happy with the product.</Text>
  <Text category="health">I got what I expected. It's functional
  and not too poorly made. The only problem I had was that the
  scratcher part was a little too sharp. I filed the sharp edges
  off and now it's great. The rolling wheels still have no function
  for me, but they don't get in the way</Text>
  <Text category="health">I ordered this as a gift and it arrived
  in less than a week... with their standard shipping! The produict
  was exactly as described. Shalimar is a classic</Text>
  <Text category="health">As expected, the new 7180XL razor
  delivers a close and comfortable electric shave, even though it
  runs much slower than earlier models. The slow speed does make it
  very quiet and the new cleaning method is very handy. Just 2
  noticable disappointments: 1. The external power supply is a
  rather combersome change from former Norelco products. 2. The
  exclusion of a storage case is certainly an unwelcome "feature"
  of an otherwise good product at a premium price</Text>
  <Text category="health">Very light electric razor. Cuts shaving
  time from 10 minutes down to 3 minutes. So a charge for 30
  minutes of shaving time easily lasts a week. When running it is
  as quiet as an old fashioned blade. Does a great job very quickly
  and smoothly. You don't need anything more</Text>
  <Text category="health">I've owned several Norelco Shavers in the
  past but the 7180XL is definitely the best. This shaver is
  extremely light weight, quiet and gives an extremely close/smooth
  shave. I find that I get 5 days of shaves on one full charge and
  a full charge takes about 50 minutes to complete. The shaver is
  also easy to clean using either wet or dry methods. The only
  complaint I have about the shaver is that no traveling case/pouch
  holder comes with it to hold the cord,shaver and cleaning brush.
  Just make sure you keep your old case holder from your previously
  owned shaver(s). Only time will tell on how this model will hold
  up. My 4 previous Norelcos have averaged around 5-6 years
  each</Text>
  <Text category="health">I bought this rechargeable shaving system
  for my husband for Christmas. It was a replacement of a corded
  shaver he had been using. He has been enjoying the features
  offered by this device. He especially likes the ability to rinse
  it out after each use. It gives a close shave and has a quick
  charge feature that allows you to charge it for a few minutes and
  gives at least two shaves. He has used the razor for about two
  weeks now with no complaints. It was a great price for a quality
  product</Text>
  <Text category="health">I Luv this Burberry. Pple always comment
  anytime I wear it. My girlfriend almost made me stop wearing it
  cos she said anytime I wear it she feels like doing things I
  can't mention here 2 me, and since she feels tht way, other women
  will certainly feel like tht. I'm getting another
  one!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Also fast and proper services by
  amazon</Text>
  <Text category="health">I purchased this for my husband as a gift
  without ever having smelled it. I based my purchase on other
  reviews, and the fact that I have the Burberry classic for women
  and love it. I crossed my fingers and hoped that the reviews were
  right. Well, they were! When this came in I could not resist; I
  had to open the box. I pulled the outer wrapping back, carefully
  pulled the box out (I was able to replace all this without hubby
  knowing), sprayed some into the air, and "ahhhh", wonderful! I
  loved it! It smells wonderful on my husband, too. It's kind of
  woodsy, but not overpowering at all. It's a classic, warm
  fragrance, and it lasts a long time. I will definitely buy this
  again</Text>
  <Text category="health">Clean and Crisp. Defined and Smooth. I
  use Burberry by Burberry for all occassions but it is great for
  the evening. IT has woodsy notes that remind me of autumn. I am
  very picky about my fragrances and I only use two regularly --
  Eau d'Issey by Issey Miyake is my main scent, but I do use
  Burberry sometimes on occassion and I love it. Thats it</Text>
  <Text category="health">This toilet paper will never feel like
  the cozy stuff that blocks the toilet on a regular basis, but it
  is a product that feels somewhat better than varieties you find
  in many public toilets. I am willing to compromise a tiny bit of
  plush, and save all the hours spent attached to toilet plungers.
  I do concern myself with any chemicals that are placed into a
  product that makes it "rapid-dissolve", and will in time, try an
  environmentaly friendly brand. A great option for family with
  kids who know no limits for toilet paper usage, and ignore the
  presence of a plunger</Text>
  <Text category="health">If you live in an old building where the
  toilet is always getting clogged by your abundant use of regular
  toilet paper, then this is the brand and variant you should
  switch to. If I were to objectively judge it by what it promises
  (rapidly dissolves...), I'd have to give it five stars. It
  practically melts as soon as it touches water. Don't expect to be
  able to use it for mopping water off the sink; you'll just end up
  with a mess of dissolved tissue. I'm giving it only four stars,
  because it's not my favorite toilet paper (that would be Charmin
  Ultra), but the necessary choice.</Text>
  <Text category="health">I use this product all the time. It was
  becoming hard to find in department stores, but I found it
  available and cheaper online. I'm very happy.</Text>
  <Text category="health">I love this product and the lasting
  results. It is so gentle on my hair. I bought two, one being a
  Christmas present for my neighbor who had recently had a very bad
  perm, and she agreed, makes the set last while not futher
  damaging your hair. If you are sleeping in curlers, sleep no
  more. This product is for you</Text>

  <Text category="health">First off, IGNORE Renee's rating, this
  woman has ISSUES!!!!!! This toothbrush works great! Would Highly
  recommend.</Text>
  <Text category="health">I love this toothbrush, its easy and it
  really imporoves your gum health</Text>
  <Text category="health">Yes, I did feel a difference. Benadryl is
  not effective for me so I was sceptical. I am glad I found this .
  I use for when I need to sleep in an unfamiliar place</Text>
  <Text category="health">This is a really good supplement to help
  you regulate your sleep pattern. People please grow up and stop
  using this Amazon review site to post useless nonsense...go BLOG
  somewhere else</Text>
  <Text category="health">This was a gift . It came on time and was
  half the price of one we had looked at . So we were happy</Text>
  <Text category="health">I really do love this item. I've been
  using it without fail since the day it arrived. I haven't had any
  significant problems with it and highly recommend it for anyone.
  I hated wearing the chest strap on my other monitor. The only
  problem I have found is that I can't grip things and have the
  monitor continue working. So when I am lifting weights I have to
  leave that finger extended, when I'm using the eliptical trainer
  I have to leave that finger extended. Now that I'm used it, it
  isn't a big deal. It is accurate. So far it has agreed with all
  other monitors that I've checked it against. So with the one
  minor exception I highly recommend it</Text>
  <Text category="health">i like guru because it has a more natural
  feeling towards your body. after drinking monster all day, my
  body felt like a mess(from the many unnatural chemicals it does
  to your body). There are so many energy drinks out there that
  have loads of chemicals, its harder to find stuff like guru and
  bawls.</Text>
  <Text category="health">Having tried most all Energy drinks, I
  can honestly say this one is different. Guru picks me up
  gradually yet does not drop me down as though my wings have been
  clipped. One at noon and I'm good to go for the rest of the day.
  Plus, I don't go home and kick the dog! The taste is not Sugary
  and at about $1.40 a can (Free Shipping) the price speaks for
  itself</Text>
  <Text category="health">I was reluctant to buy this after reading
  that it wasn't so great on fine hair, but my son's hair was
  really getting shaggy and I was *NOT* going to wrestle with him
  at the barber shop again. So I bought this and was so happy when
  it worked perfectly on his hair. I used the 1 inch guide for his
  whole head and he looks great! The vacuum got all the hair which
  is a good thing, because I cut his hair wherever he happen to be
  in the house. He didn't have to stop what he was doing and sit
  still or wear a cape, which he hates. Having his hair cut at home
  also allowed him to get familiar with the trimmer--what it sounds
  like, and feel like-- in his own time and environment. He cut his
  stuffed bear's hair first, then daddy's, then his own by himself
  and then let me cut his. What a relief to have a nice haircut and
  no kicking or screaming. At $25, it has already paid for itself.
  I'm so glad I bought it. I didn't give it 5 stars, because it is
  pretty loud and had a really crappy users manual.</Text>
  <Text category="health">Bought this for use by my husband while
  he was in a nursing home and I used it to shave and cut his hair
  with while he was there, no hair on him or pillows or sheets.
  This is wonderful for anyone that does not want a mess while
  trimming or cutting hair, I also used it on the tougher part of
  his beard. Wonderful item</Text>
  <Text category="health">it does a great job, i just tought it
  woundn't let any hair go, but i gess that's impossible</Text>
  <Text category="health">This unit has the power transformer at
  the wall socket end instead of in the handheld part. The handheld
  part is mostly made of plastic. So, it's pleasantly light to
  hold, much lighter than my Wahl homecare thing. The supplied
  guard things (that you swap to change length, etc.; IIRC they
  range from 1/8" to 1") have a curve on the bottom so it's easier
  to have them glide over concave surfaces instead of digging the
  pointed end into them. This also makes things more pleasant.
  Don't believe the no-mess story, though. It really does catch
  most of the hair, so it's certainly worthwhile, and it's easy to
  empty the hair trap, but I still have to vacuum the remainder
  afterwards. It doesn't catch it all</Text>
  <Text category="health">The product does what it says it cuts
  your hair and contains it all in a vacuum container</Text>
  <Text category="health">I have gotten numerous compliments on
  this eau de toilette. It has a light, almost woodsy smell.
  Reminds me of a laid back saturday at the country club or
  something. Classy yet sporting</Text>
  <Text category="health">I bought this product because I had one
  from years ago that I use when I go to the gym but lost. It's
  great at drying me off while i'm working out and yet the towel
  isn't wet. I am conflicted though. I bought this one when I lost
  the one I already had. It's a bit thinner and not the same
  deminsion as the original, but I still like it for what it does.
  I also like the little bag that it comes in, which I didn't have
  with the original one</Text>
  <Text category="health">After looking into several reviews on
  blow dryers, I learned about the Revlon Tourmaline. All of the
  reviews were so positive. I've been suprised at how light the
  dryer is and how easy the controls are. The placement couldn't be
  better on the controls. The price was right as well! Blow dryers
  in this class are generally much more expensive. A very good
  value</Text>
  <Text category="health">Fast, gentle, light, hair dryer. No
  frizz, quick drying results. The diffuser attachment is rather
  large and hard to pack into a small travel bag but gives good
  gentle air. The dryer is very light to hold and has a cold
  setting to finish the job. The motor can be rattling and rather
  loud but over all performance is excellent for daily use. Don't
  waste your money on the expensive ones</Text>
  <Text category="health">Very convenient reading glasses. You
  could hang them on your neck when not using them, and not even
  notice they are there. They are very sturdy, and are flexible
  making them almost imposible to break. Cons: Both sets I
  purchased I notice them to be on the narrow side. They sometimes
  can feel too tight to the side of your face. The glasses are also
  not practicable to wear for a person with long hair, as the
  glasses would trap your hair against your face</Text>
  <Text category="health">I use these glasses all the time at work.
  They sure are handy. Glad I bought them</Text>
  <Text category="health">I bought this item last month from
  Amazon.com for $149. I thought it is using some kind of hand-like
  massage motors, and not those vibration motors. When the item
  arrived and I setup, I found out they are using the vibration
  motors! A little disappointed I am. But I use it, it is not bad
  if you don't mind the vibration motors. The heat feature is
  great. However, the knod that is supposed to hold the sitting
  position isn't holding well. The leather-like material really
  feels like a lether. The vibration really vibrates the whole
  floor, so I suggest to put on carpetted areas only. I personally
  like the hand-like massage chair better. But this $149 chair is
  worth the price. Others would sell for over $300</Text>
  <Text category="health">I have owned many beard trimmers, but
  this is by far the best.</Text>
  <Text category="health">This model was given to me as a gift
  almost two years ago. I bought another off of Amazon because the
  recharge cord had a short in it, and I figured I could use a
  second one to keep in my travel bag. I'd have to say I'm pretty
  pleased with the trimmer. I like the fact that the guard slides
  up and down to the appropriate setting instead of me having to
  keep up with 4 or 5 individual plastic guards that have to be
  changed out when I want to change the trimming depth. I use it a
  few times a week, and it seems that it can go for months without
  needing a charge. The little vacuum that sucks the trimmings into
  the little holding area is not the strongest....It's catches
  probably 70% of what I trim. You'll want to be sure you're
  standing over a sink or towel when using it. Well worth the $30 I
  spent for this grooming tool</Text>
  <Text category="health">I've had several trimmers over the years
  and this one is by far the best. Strong motor, easy adjust,
  strong vacuum. Other reviewers commenting on the flimsy guard is
  kinda suprising to me. One wouldn't want to push down hard
  against the face when trimming a beard.... the idea is to glide
  the unit over your beard... you're not raking, you're trimming!
  Also the unit is easy to clean out after use. The waste
  receptacle snaps out easily, as does the cutter head in order to
  shake out or brush out debris</Text>
  <Text category="health">These are the best nursing pads out
  there. I tried several others that would not stick and would
  leak. I've never had any problems with these</Text>
  <Text category="health">This was the first brand of nursing pads
  I tried. My first few weeks of nursing were very painful and
  these pads were a bit scratchy. Yet after trying several brands
  of nursing pads, I came back to Lansinoh. They are the most
  absorbent and discreet disposable pad out there and after I had
  been nursing for a while they ended up being the most
  comfortable. The best deal I have found has been amazon's price
  for 3 boxes.</Text>
  <Text category="health">This is such a great product for nursing
  moms. It is not bulky and is reliable to keep leaks from
  happening. For a mom, this was a lifesaver for me to allow me to
  go outside without being embarassed by having a wet shirt</Text>
  <Text category="health">I have tried the gerber nursing pads, and
  one other brand. These nursing pads are the best. I have a large
  supply of milk but I have not leaked through these pads, they are
  also very soft and they are not visible through your
  clothing</Text>
  <Text category="health">It is nice if you are looking for a
  simple hair dryer. It does its job pretty nicely. The dual
  voltage option is a plus as you can use it anywhere in the world.
  A little big for travelling, but compromises with its folding
  handle and light weight. The disadvantage is that you cant use it
  on the high in 240 voltage. It is hard because you might tend to
  put it on high and then that would kill the equipment</Text>
  <Text category="health">It's small, folds down and is great to
  pack for a trip instead of your big hair dryer. I just wish you
  could set it on cool and blow as fast cuz it does get pretty hot.
  Very convenient item if you travel</Text>
  <Text category="health">great help in dental hygene, gets in hard
  to reach spots,also a lot easier than flossin</Text>
  <Text category="health">These little flosser tips put an end to
  my problem with bleeding gums. Flossing with traditional floss
  hurt because I always cut myself and deeply. It probably saved me
  from serious gum disease, and that I understand is expensive to
  treat, so I'd rather put out a few dollars rather than a few
  thousand dollars in keeping teeth and gums healthy</Text>
  <Text category="health">I'm more than satisfied with this scale.
  I was concerned that I would have to buy a more expensive scale
  to get good accuracy (see reviews of other digital scales in this
  price range,) but I've tested it several times over several days,
  and my weight varies by 2 pounds or less over the course of the
  day. My first weigh-in of the day is pretty much the same as
  previous mornings, sadly. The neutral color (grey) and glass
  would blend in well with just about any decor, and the LCD screen
  is easy to read, with 1.5 inch high numbers. The only thing I
  don't like about it is that it creaks quite a lot when I step on
  it, even though I'm nowhere near its 330 pound maximum load. That
  problem is in my head more than in the scale: I don't think it's
  going to break, but it sounds like I've got two people standing
  on it at once--I'm not THAT fat, am I? An added feature is that
  when I'm craving, I go into the bathroom and look at it, and know
  that it isn't going to fall for any of my excuses tomorrow
  morning. So the last piece of cake still sits in the fridge. The
  scale has intimidated me into not eating it. Accurate, easy to
  read, easy on the eyes, and intimidating--I think it's a good
  deal</Text>
  <Text category="health">It is really great!!! Sure, it does hurt,
  but not any more than waxing. I do not shave because I get cut
  very easily. This is a great alternative to expensive waxing.
  Even when I have more hair it works. I would buy this product

  <Text category="health">I recently purchased this lumbar support
  cushion as a gift for my father this past Christmas. I am a
  physical therapist, and have over 5 years of experience dealing
  primarily with the mechanics and mechanisms of low back pain and
  disc dysfunction. I have tried out many cushions over the years,
  and from my experience, this product is as good as any
  higher-priced product of the same intent. The composite board
  insert allows for a consistent shape to be maintained, so the
  cushion does not yield as easily to body weight over years of
  consistent use, and the burgundy cover is removable and washable.
  It is also an excellent size for the average-sized person (my dad
  is approximately 5'9", ~170 lbs.). It provides good side-bolster
  support as well for an added feeling of comfort around the
  outiside of the lower back. I highly recommend this cushion when
  placed in comparison of other similar products. Most of the other
  products out there that are in contention with this one are
  composed of unnecessary additives, like a massager, ribbing on
  the contours of the cushion, etc. I've found that simply
  maintaining good posture (not only in sitting, but all activity)
  allows for so much more freedom from pain and simple ease back
  into daily life. Again, I highly recommend this product to anyone
  out there searching for an answer to help alleviate low back
  pain; however, I must caution that commercial products are NOT a
  cure-all to one's problems. It's always possible to alleviate the
  pain and symptoms, but other steps are necessary in terms of
  FIXING the problem. I highly recommend seeking out professional
  care from a physical therapist, as it is more than likely
  necessary that one would need (at least) proper education and
  intevention to help one to get better.</Text>
  <Text category="health">I've tried several lumbar cushions from
  Amazon and this one is the most comfortable, despite being so

  <Text category="health">I bought this after using the inexpensive
  Wahls for years. I love it for several reasons: 1) It cuts
  without pulling on your whiskers 2) It is very precise 3) It
  picks up 90% or more of your whiskers 4) Not only do you not have
  the hair in the sink, but you no longer feel like it will take a
  shower to get all of the excess hair out of your beard, if there
  is any to speak of 5) Unlike others, I did not feel the need to
  have a more precision tool to trim my mustache. It worked just

  <Text category="health">I had bought a Tingler elsewhere for $20,
  plus shipping, so when I saw this one advertised for $9, I was a
  bit hesitant that it wasn't the real Tingler, but a cheap
  knock-off (especially since they show no picture). BUT, I decided
  to risk it and was pleasantly surprised to find out that it is
  not only the real Tingler, it is also shipped in a pretty velvet
  pouch for wonderful gift-giving. Amazon, of course, also offers
  free shipping for $25 or more, so I bought 3 and got them all
  shipped free! Great deal! And, by the way, it IS incredible! It
  really did send little shivers down my spine the first few times
  I used it. While you sort of get used to the feeling after a
  while and the little shivers may disappear, it still feels
  fabulous on your head</Text>
  <Text category="health">Bought this razor and happy with it so
  far. It shaves close and is not as loud as I expected. Glad I
  bought this one</Text>
  <Text category="health">Like the razor - I have problems with
  ingrown hairs on my neck and this shaver has helped to alleviate
  the problem - the Nivea lotion is very soothing. I have had to
  live with the fact that the shave on my neck is not the closest
  in the world but c'eat la vie. I have taken to running a couple
  of passses dry to get a fairly close shave and then starting to
  apply the lotion as I continue. If you start with the lotion you
  won't get a close shave. I do wonder if one couldn't simply buy a
  shaver ad apply some lotion at the end for the same affect</Text>
  <Text category="health">I never thought the world would get here.
  I am actually spending time to type up a review, online, for
  shaving lotion. Well, here you go: for every man out there who is
  interested and who has ever used an electric shaver, if you
  haven't tried the Norelco Cool Skin electric shaver with this
  lotion, you have to. Whoever has sensitive skin, you need to
  switch to this, because it does a great job. That's all I have to
  say and I won't waste anymore time</Text>
  <Text category="health">Forget the liquids and throw away lens
  tissues. This cloth works exceptionally well on my camera lenses.
  I highly recommend it, and am buying a couple more, for my car
  glove compartment for sunglasses and my computer screen.</Text>
  <Text category="health">A lot of work when into making this
  cloth, excellent for cleaning lenses of all kinds: glasses, video
  and digital cameras, etc. If you care about your lenses health,
  this is the cloth to buy, congrats 3M</Text>
  <Text category="health">... I purchased this item to remove some
  debris off my camcorder lens and found it to do the job very
  nicely. The microfiber texture feels nice - a little beady, but
  soft and textured. Using it was easy, I just wiped the lens in a
  circular fashion with light pressure and eventually the debris
  was gone. (some fingerprints and what appeared to be a scratch
  but wasn't) The packaging is a little subpar though. It comes in
  a plastic bag which you tear open at the bottom to slide the
  cloth out. However doing so leaves adhesive residue, which the
  cloth then sticks to and you have to tear it off, making those
  sections of the cloth appear phyically different - a bit roughed
  up I'd say. This is poor design as the packaging says to store
  the cloth inside the bag when not in use to avoid contamination,
  so I used a scissor to cut the bottom of the bag with the
  adhesive residue off. I've yet to machine wash it, but so far it
  works well. It's just a cheap lens cleaning cloth after
  all</Text>

  <Text category="health">This is the second Aquis Microfiber Body
  towel I have purchased. The waffle weave makes a huge difference.
  I had a plain microfiber towel and it just didn't feel like a
  towel. The Aquis towel has a real towel feel, dries me off great
  and then dries out quickly. I keep it in my gym locker and it's
  dry the next time I need it. In the summer, I use it after
  swimming in the morning and it's dry by the time I teach swimming
  in the afternoon. And it doesn't take up much room in my locker
  or gym bag. It would be great where I used to spend my summers in
  Michigan where it was tough to dry out the beach towels.</Text>

  <Text category="health">Having had perfectly clear skin through
  my teens, 20s, and most of my 30s, I now have post-pregnancy
  adult-onset cystic acne that began at age 36. My skin is far too
  delicate and sensitive to tolerate most OTC acne products. I
  bought this product out of desperation, not believing it would
  work. After reading hundreds of reviews and advice and testing it
  for 2 weeks, I have found that it works well, with some
  modifications. My experience: cystic acne goes through its normal
  cycle (rising to surface, becoming a hideous scab, etc.) in a
  fraction of the normal time (4 days versus 4 weeks) when treated
  as directed with Zeno, OR it disappears completely without ever
  having risen to the surface (after a week or so), when treated
  very aggressively with Zeno. My advice: Don't expect it to work
  after 1-3 treatments and in 24 hours as advertised. Do know that
  with diligence and patience, it will work. Be very aggressive. Do
  double-cycles (allow the Zeno to remain on your skin after it
  beeps, then press the button for a second cycle) every few hours
  as long as the bump is detectable in any way. You may get very
  slight burning of your skin (causing a whitish film or slight
  peeling) and you may go through your cartridge tips quickly, but
  believe me, it's worth it to avoid the horrible months-long
  process of cystic acne. I am using this in conjunction with a
  very thorough natural skincare regime and improved nutrition, and
  seeing the results I have hoped for after 2 weeks</Text>
  <Text category="health">There are several listings for this item
  in different versions. Before making a decision, check out the
  other versions, you will see many different reviews. Overall, it
  seems to be as long as you use the product as intended, it works!

  <Text category="health">My Mom came home from rehab and needed an
  easy way to reach her remote, pills, magazines, eat breakfast...
  and still get the table out of the way so she could reach her
  walker. This type of tray was very useful in rehab. However she
  didn't want something the looked like the hospital. The white top
  with a space for a drink and pens and pencils that don't roll
  away when you move the tray was perfect. She liked the white top
  (vs. the wood grain in rehab) since she could tell when it was
  really clean. She was also pleased with the foot rest as part of
  the base. This was perfect. The reason I rated this at 4 stars
  and not 5 stars was that the bed kit came with one incorrect size
  nut so I had to go to the hardware store.</Text>
  <Text category="health">The Oral B EB417 dual head power brush
  replacement does a great job of getting into tight places,
  reaching back teeth, removing plaque, has a nice gum massage
  action, and leaves your mouth and teeth feeling clean and very
  refreshed. The two heads work twice as good as one, but may take
  some getting used to if your used to a single brush head. Using
  it by gently guiding it over your teeth, and letting it do all
  the work, it will last a long time too. It was nearly three
  months before I had to replace mine. Most Oral B brushes are
  interchangeable with all Oral B units. This one though, according
  to the buying info here, may not be used with the Cross Action
  brush. It will also indicate when it's time for replacement by
  the fading colors of the bristles.(the box shows as good picture
  of new and used). Just a little of your favorite toothpaste goes
  a long way too! It's a 5 star product, but unless you are just
  one person who just wants to try it out, the better buy would be
  to purchase the three pack. It's almost like getting one free. My
  pack also came with different color rings, that fit on the brush
  at the base and is nice for families to tell the brushes apart.
  It's nice to have a spare for unexpected guests as well. Keep

  at,and does it well. It is light weight and maneuvers
  easily.</Text>
  <Text category="health">Overall an excellent trimmer - this is
  what I have been needing all of these years. Finally a piece of

  <Text category="health">The day I ordered this pair at Amazon, I
  saw the same Homedics slippers at Sears for $21.99 on sale and I
  was immediately assured that price wise, this is a great buy. I
  got the slippers within 3 days. The material is very soft and
  "towely", and pretty in pink- it feels really good to just walk
  in them. Though they have a battery compartment underneath the
  sole, they are not too heavy to walk in either. Each slipper uses
  2 AA batteries. The massage is actually more effective while
  sitting. And my mum and my sister keep eyeing my slippers. I
  ordered another one for my future mum-in-law as well! I'm sure
  she'll love it. Also, I wear a shoe size 8, sometimes 8.5, but
  the Homedics Small Size for the massaging slippers fit just fine,
  actually a little better coz a good fit gives a better feeling of
  the vibrations. If you're thinking of buying this, go for
  it</Text>
  <Text category="health">When I first tried this Marshmallow
  Vanishing Cr&#239;&#191;&#189;me in a sampler kit, I purchased
  five more kits and then a 1.5 ounce glass container of this
  product. Can I say it is addictive? Yes, I guess it does have a
  banana cream pie scent and the texture is similar to a banana
  cream pie topped with whip cream. To say this is decadent is an
  understatement. You will be very tempted to slather your entire
  body in a good helping of this cream. Fortunately, it goes a long
  way and absorbs extremely well. In fact, that is why they call it
  "vanishing" cr&#239;&#191;&#189;me. The ingredient list is
  impressive and contains rose water, mango butter, beeswax,
  grapeseed oil, rosehip seed oil, Vitamin E, marshmallow extract,
  willowbark extract, calendula flower extract, and a heady
  fragrance. Grapeseed oil is one of the most powerful antioxidants
  and is high in proanthocyanidins, a group of bioflavonoids that
  are superior because they are water soluble. This ingredient also
  prevents skin cell damage caused by pollution and sun exposure.
  "Marsh Mallow" is actually a pink flowering herb found in marshes
  and damp meadows. It has been used for centuries as a food and a
  medicine. The leaves and roots secrete an emollient fluid with
  healing properties for inflamed skin. In the past, people boiled
  the roots in wine to make a cough remedy. I found this luscious
  creamy dreamy product to be healing for the body and mind. Not
  only will you feel comforted by nature, your skin will be baby
  soft and this product can be used for all-over body healing. The
  silver lid and glass jar have an unusually cute appeal. If you
  love this product, you might want to try the Pore-refining mask,
  Evening Primrose Overnight Cr&#239;&#191;&#189;me and the very
  unique parsley blemish stick. To take luxury to the next level,
  try the Shea Butter Decollete Cr&#239;&#191;&#189;me on your
  feet, hands or all over your entire body. What an amazing line of
  products. They heal, protect and soothe your mind. I'm still
  trying all the Burt's Bees products, and love how these products
  make me feel. They add a level of protection to your skin care
  routine and the clay mask I recently tried cleaned my pores like
  a dream. ~TheRebeccaReview.co</Text>
  <Text category="health">I purchased the Caruso for my wife after
  returning a Conair Infinity. The Conair Infinity did not measure
  up to her expectations. She is happy with the Caruso and feels
  that it does an good job setting curl. I will offer a few
  observations of my own. I would think that companies that produce
  these devices would be more sensative to the needs of a broader
  spectum of customer. For instance, women have different lengths
  of hair. This device provides 6 petite, 6 small, 6 medium, 6
  large, 6 jumbo. That might be fine for women with shoulder length
  hair, but not for everyone. There's not enough of one size to get
  the job done. There's not enough of two sizes to get the job
  done. If your hair has just been cut, it's to short to use the
  larger sizes, unless you have long hair to start with. My wife's
  hair is not quite shoulder length, she's got a problem. So, I
  figured, no big deal, just order a dozen of the right size. One
  dozen additional rollers cost $35. I only paid $29 for the unit
  with 30 rollers. That's not what I call customer friendly.</Text>

  childrens room</Text>
  <Text category="health">This humidifier is easy to refil and not
  a big eye-sore even in small rooms. Also, stays very clean not a
  lot of build up like other humidifiers. Would give it 5 stars but
  you do have to refil it about every 8 hours. Which I guess it's
  good that it's easy to refil. The price is also the reason for 4
  stars instead of 5. I think it is a little pricey for not a lot
  of features compared to bigger ones with more features for the
  same price. Perhaps you pay for the convient size. Overall, I
  really do like this humidifer and is the only one I like to have
  in the house because of low maintence and small size.</Text>
  <Text category="health">As soon as I got this item, I tried it
  out right away. I will agree the battery cover is rather flimsy
  but that's a minor point. The real issue is whether it could do
  what it claims to do -- take down mosquitos and flys. Sure
  enough, I killed 5 mosquitos after sitting outside for just a few
  minutes. I also took down a housefly without any sweat. This is a
  great device as mosquitos are a real problem where I'm at and it
  sucks being held hostage indoors by insects. No more an
  issue</Text>
  <Text category="health">Having previously owned battery powered
  travel razors, I was always disappointed with their power and
  battery life. After all, what's the point ditching a heavier
  charger and razor if you have to carry a load of extra batteries
  and still end up stubbly faced? The Braun 370-BK was a pleasant
  surprise, however; powerful enough to hack through my hiking
  stubble and plenty of juice for an extended outing. I also liked
  the folding design which protects the cutting surfaces and keeps
  the cleaning brush from getting lost. A great piece of tech at a
  good price</Text>

  <Text category="health">Being sick and tired of shaving
  constantly and buying expensive blades, I did some research and
  decided to try an epilator. I figured I'd give this model a try.
  I have not been disappointed! Yes, it hurt the first time I used
  it--I hadn't shaved in almost a week and I had a lot of thick
  dark hair. But, it was pulling it right out. The more you use it,
  the less it hurts. I haven't had ugly, rough stubble since. I
  also like that Panasonic has included a shaver head--this works
  great to trim up too-long hairs before epilation or for the more
  sensitive areas that are just too painful to epilate. The heads
  are easily interchangable and a snap to clean. This is a great
  all-around epilator/shaver.</Text>
  <Text category="health">It is working well, little slow warm up.
  But actually I wanted a hot air brush, not this, because I have

  <Text category="health">Does everything as advertized. Love the
  turbo feature that speeds up the heating process to less than one

  <Text category="health">Definitely the best heating pad I've ever
  experienced. I'll never buy any other kind of heating pad again.
  This is by far the best and well worth the money. I love that it
  can set the temperature precisely and much higher than any other
  heating pads I've ever seen (that only have "high medium and low"
  settings, and usually the high and medium settings cause burns,
  or don't get hot enough, or go from barely any heat to burning!)
  This heating pad's lcd shows the actual temperature it's at,
  which is great. And yes it feels very moist, but not like you're
  getting dampness on your clothing. My only complaint is that it
  shuts off after 60 minutes. I could easily have this on all day

  <Text category="health">As a dentist of over 20+ years
  experience, I have seen over and over again the results of not
  flossing one's teeth. The unfortunate result of such neglect is
  cavities (especially in kids), and inevitable gum disease in
  adults, which in both cass over time leads to tooth loss. Gum
  disease almost always starts in-between the teeth and the only
  way to clean the germs that cause gum disease and cavities from
  between the teeth is with floss. Mechanical scrubbing with floss
  is the key, and all the daily brushings and rinsings will not
  remove the in-between stubborn plaque below the gumline. The
  bottom line is that we need to floss our teeth if we want to keep
  them for a lifetime. I have heard all the excuses for not
  flossing: The floss is too hard to handle, my fingers turn blue,
  my fingers are too fat, I'm too clumsy, the floss hurts my gums,
  etc, etc. This disposable flosser is great for kids, who may not
  have the dexterity to load a non-disposable flosser, such as the
  "Flossaide Dental Floss Holder", which I recommend for adults
  (see my review). I have recommended this floss aid to my young
  patients over the years and I strongly recommend it to you as
  well. One still has to develop the habit of flossing daily, and
  this device aides in the mechanics of flossing, making it a
  breeze. Get it and save your teeth! Jim "Konedog" Koeni</Text>

  "extra large" size towel (which isn't really all that

  flavor and yes I do use it as a substitute for candy every once

  <Text category="health">They are a nice compact size for travel.
  They work as advertised, just expect to let them heat up longer

  <Text category="health">I have never used a roller. After reading
  the reveiws I decided to purchase two set of rollers. I have long
  hair. It works really great on my hair. Looking at my hair
  everyone says it looks beautiful</Text>
  <Text category="health">I purchased this as a gift for a friend
  who has beautiful long hair and she told me they worked
  wonderfully. I also own a set and have had them for several years
  travelling with me to the office, gym and around the world. They
  are easy to pack and are lightweight</Text>
  <Text category="health">Great compact design. Takes up very
  little room in your suitcase. Rollers heat up &amp;amp; are ready
  to use in about 2-3 minutes like the product claims. Sets hair
  better then most rollers (and I have tried many). The only thing
  that I would change, is to add 2-4 more rollers. But I liked
  these rollers so much, I actually bought a 2nd set &amp;amp; use
  these at home over the 5 other sets of rollers I own!</Text>
  <Text category="health">This is the one I buy for friends and the
  one they use at my pediatricians office. It is like the one I
  bought 5 years ago with my first baby, the one that is still
  humming along. I have been really happy with our thermometer with
  the exception that it was-and-is still too big to use with my
  second child, a boy who persists in having 'tiny' ear canals even
  though he is three now. It has worked well for every other kid I
  know though. About the variation in temperature taking. My advice
  is to practice taking your and your children's temperature while
  you and they are healthy. For one thing, not everyone has the
  `standard' 98.6 degree normal temperature; and for another thing
  it isn't always easy to get the tip pointed in the right
  direction once it is in the ear canal. It takes practice. A good
  home purchase. (For really little babies we used a pacifier
  thermometer with great success.</Text>
  <Text category="health">I got this product when the price dropped
  down to $12. So for that price I liked this product a lot. It
  heats the lotion well. Initially I thought it was small, but now
  I think it is the correct size. I did not realize how much better
  it is to apply heated lotion until this. I switch it on when I go
  for a bath and by the time I am back, the lotion is ready and
  warm. It is a great buy, and for all you bargain shoppers, wait
  till the price drops. It is especially a great buy during
  winter</Text>

  those of us living in colder climates - especially in the winter.
  The warm lotion is truly a treat to dry, itchy winter skin.

  It's a rich overnight foot cream with a pleasant smell. My feet
  felt softer in the morning after using it at night and I noticed
  a difference immediately in my dry, cracked heels. I also ended
  up using it on my hands and elbows before I went to bed.
  Especially my hands were really soft in the morning. I've tried
  other foot creams and not been really impressed. But I think the
  difference is that Dr. Scholl's has no alcohol in it, and it's
  really rich so you can actually feel the moisture in your

  <Text category="health">I agree with the previous reviewer. I

  <Text category="health">I bought this scale for my wife (ya, I'm
  that sort of guy)! She's definitely not heavy, but 'concerned'
  and a follower of Weight Watchers. I was shocked to read various
  scale reviews prior to purchasing this one and find so many that
  did not weigh accurately! Well, this one was highly rated by most
  reviewers for accuracy &amp;amp; they are right. This scale is
  very accurate in determing a person's mass (sorry, I was a
  Physics major too) and confirmed at her Weight Watchers'
  weighings. As for it's accurate determination of "body fat" and
  "water", I can't say, but feel these are a bit gimicry anyway. As
  for my wife, she loves the scale &amp;amp; me. Although, her love
  for me covers over many poorly chosen gifts, so I'm not
  absolutely sure about her love for the scale. However, I do know
  she uses it ever day and enjoys telling me of her
  victories</Text>

  <Text category="health">My bedroom receives an inordinate amount
  of morning light and, being a light sleeper, I've tried numerous
  ways to protect my slumber. It doesn't help that my husband (God
  love him) snores as loud as a small jet plane. I've tried
  silicone ear plugs and satin eye masks only to find that the
  plugs make me feel like I have a head cold and the masks leave
  unwanted gaps that let in the light. I received the Tranquility
  Zone eye mask for a birthday present and I could hardly wait to
  try it. I LOVE this thing! It's thick and large enough to block
  out all of the light and, due to the design, the mask is
  positioned perfectly over my ears. The sounds are pleasant (I'm a
  big fan of the "Babbling Brook" track) and I love being able to
  plug my mp3 player in so I can listen to my own nature-sounds
  tracks, too. I've given this 5 stars because there's no option
  for 4.5. In all honesty, there are a few drawbacks. First, when I
  say this is thick I'm not kidding. Without my A/C in the summer
  it might get a bit warm. Second, the sound clips themselves are
  on very short loops... so if you have a brain like mine that
  tunes in to what you're hearing you'll notice that the clip
  repeats itself every 5 seconds or so. Were it not for this I'd be
  a bigger fan of the first track -- the one that sounds like
  you're in a forest -- but I get distracted (and awakened) by
  hearing that bird sound that comes closer then fades. Even with
  these things in mind, I have to say I haven't slept this well in
  YEARS. I love this thing, and I wish I'd found it earlier. In
  fact, I love it so much I've given it as a gift to two friends
  who'd tried on my mask while they were visiting and fell in love
  with it, too</Text>
  <Text category="health">If you have trouble sleeping...THIS mask
  is for you!! For anyone struggling to get even a few minutes
  worth of sleep... You will not be disappointed!! Fabulous!
  Whether for a nap or for getting through the night - this mask
  will definitely help! I have given several as gifts and everyone
  is in agreement with me! The only negative is - the company
  changed from an endless sound model to 30 minutes of
  sound...therefore - I wake up and have to re-hit the sound
  selection...but, I'm still getting more sleep than I have in
  years and years!</Text>

  <Text category="health">I looked a many other back support pads.
  Some were too big, and others were just complicated. The Obus
  Forme Side to Side is perfect. It is very light weight and small,

  to the office. The strap on the back fits well around any chair

  <Text category="health">This dryer works great but it gets pretty

  <Text category="health">The stuff can seem somewhat pricy
  (specially on a college budget) but it's well worth it. The taste
  isn't much to talk about; you're better of just holding your nose
  and chugging it at once. Then again, weightlifters don't eat
  supplements for taste do they? I have a huge energy problem, I
  lack it a lot. Between class and work, I'm usually drained at the
  end of the day, but this stuff helps me get into the gym and hit
  it hard. This isn't to say that it won't requre motivation on
  your part, but it sure helps. During the workout, you may notice
  an increase in your pump. My muscles felt so tight and big, that
  I just wanted to lift more and more. By the time I was done, I
  went to the lockeroom to change and saw a monster in the mirror.
  I've had great pumps before, but this was insane! It didn't even
  look like me at all; it felt great. I've been using it for 2
  months now and I don't train a day without it. Highly, highly
  recommended</Text>
  <Text category="health">There's nothing like grabbing a warm

  <Text category="health">I bought this for my mom for Christmas. I

  <Text category="health">Clif Bars are amoung the best tasting
  energy bars I have ever tried. They may not pack as many calories

  <Text category="health">The best sports bar around. Great taste,
  organic, contains plenty of Antioxidants, and contains a good
  amount of protein. The only down side is the high amount of
  carbs, especially the sugars, but I still give it five

  <Text category="health">Clif Bars have been part of my families

  <Text category="health">I absolutely love this stuff. I would
  recommend this to any person that has frizz. It makes my hair
  feel so silky smoothe. I started using it about 2 months ago and
  cannot stand to go without it. Just use a little because it can
  make your hair look oily if you use too much and don't put it
  close to the scalp either for the same reason. I tried the Chi
  Silk Infusion because I thought they would be the same since they
  are both made by Farouk but the Chi is not nearly as good. I
  would give this 100 stars I could.</Text>
  <Text category="health">Had I read these reviews before buying
  this, I probably wouldn't have purchased it. But I had been
  looking at the much more expensive Sonicare toothbrushes after my
  dentist recommended Sonicare after I asked. I didn't ask if there
  was a certain MODEL that he recommended, so I assumed I'd have to
  pay from $40-$150 for a Sonicare. When I saw this one for $30 at
  Target, I figured I didn't have much to lose. I've had no
  problems with any of the other problems mentioned and have been
  happy with how it makes my teeth feel super clean and has even
  cleaned this spot that even my dental hygienist couldn't get. It
  turns off automatically after 2 minutes, so I know that I'm
  brushing my teeth longer. One thing that takes getting used to is
  NOT removing it while it's going...you'll splatter toothpaste all
  over yourself! :D Another plus is not having your tummy jiggle
  like it does with a manual toothbrush!! The only negative is that
  it goes thru 2 AA batteries about once a month, but the
  directions said that it lasts about 60 brushes per battery change
  and that's about right. I've started using rechargable batteries
  and have had no problems.</Text>
  <Text category="health">I have a few minor quibbles with this
  razor, but it gives you a nice close, comfortable shave. And
  isn't that what we want in the end? I don't know anyone who buys
  one of these things for its "ergonomic design features." It holds
  the charge for a good long time, and shaves your face nice. Rinse
  it clean with running water and you're done. That's what I'm
  looking for. The only things keeping me from a 5 star review is
  I'm not yet comfortable with how the razor sounds when running.
  It seems like it's always needing a charge...but that's how it
  sounds at full charge. It will take some getting used to I
  guess..others might find the quiet running mode a plus. Also, the
  monthly cleaning of the cutters/combs is a bit
  complicated.</Text>
  <Text category="health">Have had several Norelco razors over the
  years. This is the closest shave I have ever gotten from any
  electric razor - and it is also the quietest. Only comment is
  that it requires recharging more frequently that its claims but
  not enough of a problem to offset the quality of shave. Highly
  recommend</Text>
  <Text category="health">Upgraded from an old Norelco to this and
  just love it. Shaves close and almost effortlessly including the
  very course hair over the upper lip. The only con I see is the 8
  hour charge time, which has been the norm for Norelcos in this
  class for a long time. If you need a very good basic electric
  shaver for a good price, this is a great choice</Text>
  <Text category="health">Upgraded to this razor after my old
  Remington died, and I've been very happy with it. It cut a bit
  close, which irritated my skin at first, but I think that was
  just me getting used to the "Lift &amp;amp; cut." This would be
  an excellent razor if it wasn't for two features (or lack
  thereof) that make it a pain to use. 1. The internal battery is
  NiCd. This type of battery has "memory" to it, which means for
  optimal performance, the battery should be fully drained before
  you recharge it. Otherwise, the life of the battery will slowly
  shorten until the battery is useless. 2. There isn't a low
  battery indicator. By itself, either of these features wouldn't
  pose a problem. Combined, you're left wondering when you'll have
  to charge the shaver, or when you're off on that business trip,
  if you'll need to bring the charger. In the long run, this razor
  is cheap enough and I expect the battery to last for years.
  Still, it would have been better if the battery was made of NiMH
  or some technology that's not 15 years old.</Text>
  <Text category="health">The refills were easy to order &amp;amp;
  fit my brush perfectly. It's a lot easier ordering on line
  &amp;amp; received in home rather than trying to find the
  merchandise in a store</Text>
  <Text category="health">Product arrived as expected. I've had the
  tooth brush for about a year now and I love it. One complain I
  have is that the interior of the brush head can get pretty dirty.
  It cleans up pretty well with a soak in warm water and bleach. I
  have not tried soaking it in Oxyclean, that might work even
  better.</Text>
  <Text category="health">The first epilator that I used was The
  Epi-lady with coils that came out in the 80's. I did not use this
  for long.... A tool of complete TORTURE! I finally got brave
  enough to give epilators a try again and got one from "VEET"
  which has a single roller of tweezers but it did such a good job
  that I was completely hooked on using an epilator. Good-bye
  razors and wax! I figured that if a single roller did a good job
  that the Conair which had two rollers would do even better. The
  Conair does a good job and I'm keeping it as my spare, but the
  epilator from Veet actually does a better job. I no longer have
  any discomfort from the epilators and I even do my bikini area
  and underarms. I love the results on my underarms and the money
  saved on waxing. Once you see and feel the results you will be
  completely won over. UPDATE: I've had more time to use the Conair
  Epilator and now I've actually been using it more than my "Veet".
  Just give yourself time to adjust to this epilator and you will
  be very happy with it. As a matter of fact I am ordering one as a
  gift for one of my friends</Text>
  <Text category="health">This an excellent tool to self massage

  I have woken up a couple times trenched. They are very thin and
  discreet. Other pads are not as big so not enough overage. I
  never bother with the adhesives b/c they don't work. They are a
  must for nursing moms and pumping moms in the first few month

  <Text category="health">I found this to be a good product and it
  works well in my hair it does exactly what I want it to and I
  only paid $14.99 for it. It doesn't cause my hair to frizz up and
  it's easy to style when I take the rollers out. As far as it
  taking too long to heat up, I don't really let that affect my
  review because I plug it in and while it is heating up I do my
  makeup or something else. (I'm a multi-tasker anyway) I also
  don't find that the clips leave a mark in my hair but my hair has
  some perm in it so it may do that on straighter hair. Overall I
  like it.</Text>
  <Text category="health">Over the years, I have tried many
  different brands and types of heated rollers and I never liked
  using any of them. I recently bought a new set which I had to
  return due to the fact that I had a terrible time trying to roll
  my hair on the almost smooth surface of the rollers and then
  after clipping the rolls, they would immediately fall out of my
  hair....scream! I bought the Remmington #1080N wax core roller
  set and I have finally found the easiest and quickest way to curl
  my hair. The rollers surface, when warm, grab the hair ends
  immediately to allow great control when trying to roll even short
  hair. The rollers are held in place by a full clip which looks
  more like a comb so the clips do not leave a ridge in my hair.
  Once heated, the rollers are relatively cool to the touch (no
  more burned fingers) but due to the wax core, the rollers hold
  plenty of heat and it takes just a few minutes after setting to
  produce excellent, long lasting results. The set takes about 10 -
  15 minutes to warm up. I've found the warm up time takes longer
  than the time I actually leave the curlers in my hair. This is
  the Best curler set I have EVER used. If I was to ask for one
  change, it would be a quicker warm up time. However, just the
  fact that rolling is so quick and easy, makes up for the few
  extra minutes of preparation. I'm hard to please, so my
  recommendation says alot. Thanks Remmington (I still don't like
  your other regular rollers! Ha)</Text>
  <Text category="health">I have had this heating pad for several
  months and have never had a problem with it. It gets very
  hot/warm very fast and is very comforting. I use it on my neck
  and shoulders to help relax the muscles that cause some
  headaches. I would recommend this product to anyone. I'm
  purchasing another one for my stepfather as a gift</Text>
  <Text category="health">I have read reveiws before i bought it
  that said the trimmer "pinches" or cut people, but i haven't
  found that to be the case. I wouldn't use it in ultra sensitive
  places (but i try not to use anything sharp and potentially
  dangerous near sensitive areas) but it does the trick quite well.
  I have really enjoyed it and think it functions really well for a
  good price. It also has an attachment to be a regukar shaver
  (which wasn't advertised when i bought it) but worked well on my
  legs; not as great as some more expensive electric leg shavers
  but is great when you don't have much time. All in all i suggest
  buying it.</Text>

  coworkers. We are all on our feet all day long. After one other
  coworker told us about the one he had, we all had to have one to
  help our tired feet. Everyone of us is very happy with this
  product. It is a great value for the price. There are other
  messagers that are more expensive but these are just super. We

  <Text category="health">We keep this in our kitchen and sanitize

  sanitizers. We've even started to use it on more things around
  the house like toothbrushes, etc. to periodically clean them. I

  <Text category="health">Works great but I wish I could find it in
  stores. The one RiteAid that does carry it, doesn't always have
  it in stock. I also can not always find it in just any Rite Aid.
  Some don't carry it at all...annoying! My daughter is the canker
  sore sufferer. I did some research before I discovered Rembrandt,
  and found that the ingredient, Sodium Lauryl Sulfate, found in
  almost all toothepastes is the culprate. Rembrandt for Canker
  Sores does not contain this key ingredient. Sodium lauryl sulfate
  (SLS) is what makes our toothepaste foam. My daughter hardly ever
  has anymore canker sore breakouts. If she does, it seems to be
  from getting a cold. Try and find a toothpaste without SLS...they
  aren't out there. It would be nice to have some competition to
  bring the price down and be more readily available. But all in
  all, I'm glad someone has made this product available, even if
  it's pricey and hard to find.</Text>

  <Text category="health">These wipes are strong, have just the
  right amount of moisture, and don't leave that slimy feeling that
  most of the major brands leave. My son had diaper rashes as a
  newborn; when we were at home, we could wash/rinse him with water
  and dry completely before rediapering, but when we were out, and
  had to use wipes, his rash would flare up. After switching to
  these wipes and 7th Gen diapers, the rash went away. Later on, I
  tried Pampers again, and the rash came back. Using Seventh Gen
  really has kept his skin rash free. My older son also has a lot
  of itching when we use Pampers; much less with these wipes
  &amp;amp; diapers</Text>
  <Text category="health">I don't know if it makes your hair shiny
  or not (I never noticed increased shine) however, I do think it
  does it does a nice job. It worked better when my hair was around
  shoulder length, but it puts a nice curl in your hair and as long
  as it's not too humid out, it stays in. Now that my hair is down
  to my waist, it doesn't hold curl anymore. Just a little on the
  ends and if it's even a little humid, forget it. The main thing
  that bothers me about this set is the clips that hold the rollers
  in. I don't know what they were thinking, but they really suck.
  They pull on your hair a little while they're holding the roller
  in and make you look an awful lot like madusa. Anyone who happens
  to see you will most certainly have a few jokes and laughs</Text>

  <Text category="health">Although the compartments seem small, you

  <Text category="health">I have had this heating pad for over a
  year and am very pleased with it. The auto shut off is annoying
  when I forget to reset the pad and it goes completely cool but
  otherwise, very pleased. Just ordered one for my grandma and she
  is thrilled with the soft cover and the fact that it doesn't
  "rattle" like the old fashioned ones. Great improvment and larger
  size</Text>
  <Text category="health">It works so great. I broke my left wrist
  and was in a cast for nine weeks. I will be using the stand after
  I can use my left wrist. It is very sturdy and adjust to
  different hights</Text>
  <Text category="health">Smells DIVINE! This is a powder-sweet and
  refreshing scent that won't overwhelm the senses. It's soft and
  subtle, yet killer if it complements your body chemistry. I love
  using this particular fragrance (especially during special
  occasions). It exudes both simplicity and
  sophistication--wonderful qualities that make me feel so feminine
  and utterly sexy!!! Try it</Text>
  <Text category="health">This razor is fantastic. The gel pieces
  are very soft and keep even my dry skin from being too bad!! The
  only problem I had with it was the gel parts don't last quite as
  long as a bottle of shaving cream/gel would. But if you are
  looking for a quick, handy and yet still good shave, this is
  exactly what you are looking for</Text>
  <Text category="health">I had never used an auto cuff before, so
  I had my doubts, but after using this over a period of weeks it
  seems to be right on the money every time. I would buy it
  agai</Text>
  <Text category="health">I have used this blood pressure monitor
  almost every day for weeks and it works great. It's an excellent
  value and I would recommend it to my friends without
  reservation</Text>
  <Text category="health">I have purchased a total of 12 of these
  batteries (6 two-packs) and I must say that they work exactly how
  I projected them to. They hold a charge well enough for my uses
  in various electronics and my infant's papasan swing. Regular
  Duracell alkalines will keep the swing running for a few days.
  These batteries on a full charge almost match the alkalines' life
  and I have recharged and reused many times already with no sign
  of charge loss. I am very pleased so far with my purchase. Get
  these until hybrid nimh batteries in size D become easily
  available and cheaper</Text>
  <Text category="health">I didn't have any trouble with them being
  too large. I tested them in a battery-operated light string
  against a no-name, non-rechargeable brand and they lasted almost
  exactly the same amount of time.</Text>
  <Text category="health">Excellent product, easy to mount and the
  clarity of the mirror is great</Text>
  <Text category="health">The mirror is great. I use it for shaving
  my face and it fits the bill perfectly. Both the normal and 5x
  mirrors are nice and clear</Text>
  <Text category="health">The Jerdon 7P7506CF (or as I call it, the
  ol'6CF) is a nice, reflective wall-attachable mirror. I can't say
  enough about how reflective this thing is; I'm a bit of an
  amateur facepainter (although I have zero artistic ability- my
  Spider-Man faces usually end up looking like spotty tomatoes), so
  I need a good mirror whenever I self-paint. I have gone through
  three similar models before finding the 6CF, and none has been as
  clear and user-friendly. In short, if you're looking for the best
  mirror value for your dollar, I can't recommend this thing
  enough. It's the mirror of the 21st century, and beyond</Text>
  <Text category="health">This is a good medium priced shaver. It
  does a good job, is fast, and easy to clean. It is attractive,
  and fits the hand well. Not top of the line, but a good value.
  Nothing negative to report.</Text>
  <Text category="health">I have a Braun 8995 shaver which is
  fairly good but upon reading the reviews I just had to try out
  the Panasonic and I am v impressed. Dry it shaves v slightly
  closer than the braun but with just a splash of water and a dab
  of king of shaves gel the result is amazing and quite quick too,
  a v close shave in about 2 minutes. I keep stroking my face to
  feel the smoothness. I dont use the cleaning station, I just
  rinse it under the tap so the only ongoing cost will be the foil
  and cutters but with the results I am getting I am well
  pleased</Text>
  <Text category="health">Now my husband can't "borrow" my gasses
  and I NEVER loose them. I have one of each color and get rave
  comments every time I take them off in front of strangers.</Text>
  <Text category="health">I like the shampoo. It is nice. But I do
  not like the plastic bottle. Because you cannot remove the
  cap</Text>
  <Text category="health">I work at a nursing home for the elderly
  and travel my entire lunch break to take my kindergardener to
  daycare after school and then pick him up with my two year old to
  go home, and to know that I have this product at my beck and
  call. WOW!! I am a owner of this product for 6 months now and I
  all I can say is I love it.. So what is requires special water a
  gallon lasts me for two months so I don't mind spending $.75
  every two months. I use it in conjunction with my pore cleanser
  from Panasonic and I now I use less make up than ever. I normally
  wear foundation, pressed powder and loose. Now it is just pressed
  powder. It allows my natural glow to come out and minimized my
  pores. I do my facial with a towel over my head to intensify the
  treatment along with a favorite cd and I am on a fifteen minute
  vacation without leaving home. I take the towel off and my pores
  are ready for the final stage. I turn on the cool mist and apply
  a moisturizer at the last minute and I am ready to face another
  day.</Text>
  <Text category="health">I bought it for my daughter's birthday.
  She says it hurts at first but really gets the kinks out. She is
  very pleased with it</Text>
  <Text category="health">Convenient to use, good battery life,
  good shave for an electric shaver, but still not as good as a
  blade. Also a little hard to use at edges, such as sideburns,
  under and around nose</Text>
  <Text category="health">I have loved Dolce &amp;amp; Gabanna
  light blue since it came out. I was so excited to find it at such
  a competitive price at amazon, and am certainly a satisfied
  customer! The shipping was so fast, I was expecting to wait at
  least 2 weeks, and it was delivered ahead of schedle! Thanks so
  much</Text>
  <Text category="health">Great price, free
  shipping....basically...I LOVE IT!! I placed my order on Sunday
  and got it 8:00 a.m. Tuesday morning...I HIGHLY recommend this
  seller...I will definitely continue to buy from this seller
  myself..</Text>
  <Text category="health">I loved it and guys really love it. The
  smell is so fresh and clean.</Text>
  <Text category="health">I'm usually a very skeptical person and I
  don't trust too many things that say they will help you do this
  or that in a short amount of time. But these vitamins actually do
  work. It takes some time and they are pretty expensive but they
  work. So if you need something to help your hair grow you should
  buy these vitamins cause amazingly they do work and will show
  results. The only thing I hate about the product is the price.
  But if you have money and want help with growing your hair then
  you're in luck. I'm young and I don't have alot of money so I
  can't buy these vitamins all the time. But if you have a steady
  cash flow then you're in luck and they will totally help
  you</Text>
  <Text category="health">Unlike many of the other reviewers, I
  actually bought this shaver to use on my head. I have been
  shaving my head for the past 2 years and during that time have
  used a Panasonic ES8066. It was a fine product (able to be used
  either wet or dry, unlike the Braun), but I had no idea that
  upgrading to the Braun 8985 would make such a difference. I
  shaved my head in one third the time it took me using the
  Panasonic! No longer did I need to keep going over the same spot
  again and again. The Braun took off the hair in one or two
  passes, cutting just as close with considerable ease and less
  irritation. I can't believe I wasted two years shaving with my
  old shaver! I know Panasonic has since come out with new and
  improved shavers, and I can't comment on its new Vortex shaver,
  but I know I won't be returning my new Braun any time soon</Text>
  <Text category="health">This is the best shaver I have found
  during 25 to 30 years of electric shaving</Text>
  <Text category="health">I bought this for my wife when her
  Sonicare died. She loves it. Great price. She didn't want the
  better one and is very happy with it. Her teeth look great and
  she likes the way they feel after brushing</Text>
  <Text category="health">Initially the sensation made me giggle.
  After a couple uses I got used to the process and have even
  changed my initial thoughts that the whole timing idea was silly.
  My teeth feel cleaner, mouth fresher, and I'm hopeful that I will
  no longer get the "floss" lecture from my dental team. Now that's
  something to smile about!</Text>
  <Text category="health">Haven't had to clean it yet and it keeps
  the humidity level in out daughter's room between 41 and 53%. We
  have had it for 3 months now and no problems at all. Works as
  advertised and worth every penny</Text>
  <Text category="health">I have been using this line of products
  since they were marketed. My Plastic Surgeon(not used for facial
  needs)keeeps remarking on my skin and has to remind himself that
  I am 61!</Text>
  <Text category="health">My last Braun Razor was model 6550, which
  I purchased 7 years ago. The Braun 8975 is a pleasure using,
  quick and close shave. The technology has come a long way. I have
  always used Braun and this is by far the best yet.</Text>
  <Text category="health">I was skeptical of this product -
  especially at the price - however I am so pleased with its
  effectiveness. I rely on other reviewers remarks and so I am
  writing to tell you that it is definately worth the price. I
  can't believe how quickly it clears up a pimple. When I think of
  all the money I've spent on products over the years - and I'm in
  my 40s! I was tired of buying products that overdried my skin but
  left me with a red, angry looking spot. This product is truly
  amazing and works as effectively on mild acne. I only wish the
  Zeno was around when I was a teenager</Text>
  <Text category="health">These glasses are a great idea. However,
  they do not work with long hair. The back "strap" of the glasses
  has to ride high up on the back of the head for the lenses to
  rest low on the nose (so you can see over them for distance).
  Long hair lays on the back of the glasses and pushes them down in
  the back, making the front of the glasses pop up and placing the
  lenses right in front of the eyes. I guess most people who need
  reading glasses don't have long hair</Text>
  <Text category="health">Good Product - the pressure could be a
  little stronger with the sponge head. It has a nice scent, and
  when the crystals had leaked upon arrival I had excellent
  customer service from the company to replace it.</Text>
  <Text category="health">This was my heating pad, but my hairless
  cat took it over. He has a special pet heating pad of his own
  that he loved until he discovered this one. The first day I
  couldn't pry him off. I love that it's washable. In fact, I'm
  getting a second one for him to use while the others in the wash.
  Of course, I keep it pretty low for him. Being able to choose the
  times for shutoff is nice too since a lot of heating pads shutoff
  in two hours and some days that's not enough.</Text>
  <Text category="health">This heating pad wraps around, stays put,
  does a perfect job and turns off by itself. Spend the money and
  get a better mousetrap</Text>
  <Text category="health">Pink Sugar is a wonderful scent. I have
  received many compliments on this fragrance. Its not a strong
  scent nor is it perfumey. It is however a sweet scent. Everyone i
  know that has this fragrance loves it. At this price $32.14 for
  3.4 oz spray you cannot find it cheaper anywhere else and free
  shipping on top of that. I say buy it you cannot go wrong</Text>
  <Text category="health">I get compliments all the time on this
  scent. It is one of my favorites. It smells exactly like cotton
  candy. Its fun, flirty, and nostalgic of childhood romps at the
  fair! If you like sweet edible scents, then this one is for
  you</Text>
  <Text category="health">I've tried for literally the last 6 years
  to find a way to straighten my hair (and have it stay straight)!
  I am happy to say that I've finally found something that works!
  I've had many different straighteners, and this one is by far the
  best. I have long curly hair, and this straightener gets it done
  in about 20 minutes. Much better than the hour I'm used to. Plus,
  the straightening lasts. My hair stays completely flat all day,
  instead of curling up on the ends like it did with my other
  straightener. You simply can't get better than this!</Text>
  <Text category="health">I bought this straightener at the advice
  of my hairdresser (well, the PINK one was my idea) and this is by
  far the best product I've ever used. I even took a long run
  yesterday and my hair still looks great - and it's usually a
  nappy, tangled mess after I work out. There really is nothing
  better than the CHI for straight, silky hair. I've used it on a
  couple friends and they swore to go out and buy it. It's worth
  the price</Text>
  <Text category="health">My arms used to get so sore because I'd
  blow-dry my thick, frizzy, curly hair for about 1 1/2 hours and
  then have to go over it again with a cheapy flat iron from
  wal-mart. After having a stylist at Mastercuts use this on my
  hair and achieve even better results in under half an hour, I
  knew I had to buy this product. This is a great price considering
  at most places like Trade Secret, the iron alone can cost about
  $129 plus tax, plus the Chi products are $15 and up. It's a great
  value, and it benefits a great cause, so why not? So if you have
  unruly, thick, curly hair- this is the product for you! Just be
  careful because it does get really hot- I burned my ear a bit.
  Other than some common sense, anyone can use it and achieve great
  results. I tried messing with it to flip out my hair and curl it,
  and I've almost got it down</Text>
  <Text category="health">Over the years at various jobs, I have
  seen this flashlight several times. It is abused and subjected to
  the most terrible chemical and physical abuse. It may end up
  looking beat up and yucky, but they always work, no matter what
  the contractor or whomever does to it. If you need a reliable
  flashlight for the toolbox, work truck, pick-up glove
  compartment, etc., this is the only one you need. If you need a
  good flashlight at home, and tired of buying and throwing out all
  those junky flashlights from the grocery store, this one will be
  the last flashlight you will ever have to buy. I finally bought
  one just for my home, and I am only sorry I did not do this years
  ago (I am also happy to have one of these things that is not
  totally beat up like the one in my toolbox; I refuse to replace
  it). I like this version because it has a strong magnet, and you
  stick onto the refrigerator or the side of your truck. I also
  like that it has switch guards, so it will not be accidentally
  turned on because it is buried beneath 25# of stuff in your
  toolbox. One nit-picky complaint. It has a clip for a spare bulb
  behind the reflector. However, it comes empty and you have to
  supply your own, so buy a spare bulb at the same time you buy
  this flashlight.</Text>
  <Text category="health">First, this is a big and cumbersome....
  but second, this is the best foot spa. Got it for the wife and
  had to try it myself. I am a wuss when it comes to super hot
  temps and I had to ease into the heat, it stayed hot the entire
  time. The jets were nice and the wireless remote is priceless
  (just make sure its in your hand when you sit down so you don't
  have to move an inch :) ). The rollers on the bottom are nice
  too. It gets loud when on high-jets mode, but nothing to grand.
  Fast shipper, would recommend</Text>
  <Text category="health">The dispenser looks good, holds a decent
  volume of shampoo, conditioner etc. It is simple to refill the
  bottles, and so far there is no leakage. The mounting was easy,
  glued onto the tiles with silicone glue (included). If it broke
  or we decided to replace it, we would probably struggle quite a
  bit to get it off the tiles. The top shelf does not have a cross
  bar on the front, so if you mount the dispenser under your shower
  head, the hose will knock over whatever you might place on the
  shelf. The little hooks will hold disposable razors but not the
  ones with larger heads. Overall satisfied, good product for the
  price</Text>
  <Text category="health">This was sent to my daughter and
  son-in-law as a thank you present for a recent visit. I had
  noticed numerous bottles on the floor of their shower and thought
  it would be a great way to neaten it up. They love it!!! Not only
  does it get rid of the clutter and make it easier to dispense
  soap, shampoo,etc., my son-in-law can now shave in the shower and
  keep his shaving paraphernalia there as well</Text>
  <Text category="health">Used to have a lot of liquid soap and
  shampoo get washed down the drain by my two kids... kids will be
  kids... but now they really like having their own dispenser
  buttons to push. Easy to mount and easy to use</Text>
  <Text category="health">It is very easy to use, turns on very
  quickly, and seems to be quite accurate. I also love that there
  are no extras required (e.g., ear tip covers). The kids want to
  have their temperature taken</Text>
  <Text category="health">I own this unit for more than a year.
  Bought it in the local drug store for $20. First unit was bad,
  displaying low battary error. I exchanged it same day for another
  one. I compared readings with traditional thermometers and found
  it to be very accurate, fast, and can show in both C and F. The
  best I've ever had. The case is bad - lock broke in a week</Text>
  <Text category="health">I was all set to do the typical 10 day
  antibiotic course for a sinus infection (I even had bought the
  antibiotics), but decided to try this first. It is very effective
  in clearing the sinuses, nose, throat and lungs. Couple things:
  1. It makes a minor mention of using a solution (if desired) in
  the tank provided. I used Vicks. It more than doubles the steam
  output. So even if you don't get a solution, use plain water.
  Without it, the output is not impressive. 2. If you do get Vicks,
  get your magnifying glass out and read the dilution instructions.
  They do not make it clear without reading the fine print that it
  is a highly concentrated solution. If you add it undiluted, I
  think you'll go blind... I highly recommend this unit</Text>
  <Text category="health">This Mabis Steam Inhaler REALLY puts out
  the steam! I am very satisfied and would heartily reccommend this
  item to anyone looking for a steam inhaler</Text>
  <Text category="health">Great price, good product, escellent
  service. I will buy from this supplier again</Text>
  <Text category="health">Just love the Homedic foot bath. Easy to
  use and very ssothing on the feet. the pedicure attachments are a
  plus. The price was just great!</Text>
  <Text category="health">this is really fun to do with a friend
  its so spa like i love it! but it has so many warnings im afraid
  to do something wrong</Text>
  <Text category="health">This is a great sized foot bath. I pour
  hot water in it, sit back and relax. It doesn't keep the water
  warm, but if I start off with really hot water it stays warm
  until I'm ready to get out. Using the pedicure attachements is
  hard work though- I just assume use a hand-held brush. The bubble
  feature is too loud to use while watching TV. Still, for the
  price, I like this foot bath. I've even given it as a gift</Text>
  <Text category="health">I bought this for my boyfriend. I needed
  something affordable, and this was it. The bubble machine is
  quiet, and the warmth of the water lasts for a pretty long time.
  The only complaint i have are the warnings it has. It just gets
  me uneasy and that something drastic might happen if I make a
  mistake. well other than that, this product is good. I've had it
  for I think a couple of months now, and nothing awful has
  happened and it's still working fine. :</Text>
  <Text category="health">This product gives your hair great volume
  without looking greasy.(Be careful not to use too much!) It works
  best if you have a little time to diffuse your hair with a blow
  dryer! Not surprisingly, when I use curl conscious many people
  will compliment the curls and the depth it adds to my hair :)I
  wish it would combat frizz a little more, but my hair is less
  frizzy when I use it. I guess the next thing I'll try is the
  Bumble and Bumble Frizz Fighter</Text>
  <Text category="health">I've had my son in Huggies brand since he
  was born. I started out with newborns and just went up in size. I
  loved them and they never sagged (unless they were really full).
  I loved the trim look to them. When I had to get Pampers brand
  because the store was out, the pampers brand always looked like
  he had a full sagging load. Even if I had just put them on and
  they were dry! When my son was 1, he decided to take off the
  "tape" on the daipers and he just would not keep it on. So I
  switched him to pull ups. He kept those on and has been in pull
  ups for 3 years. Sometimes they did leak at night, because he
  went too much, but if I changed him once a night he was fine. Now
  that he's older, I don't have to change him, because he doesn't
  go at night. These are really best out there, and they don't look
  like they are always sagging like other diapers</Text>
  <Text category="health">I love this book light! It has survived
  countless drops to the hardwood floor by me and my 2 year old. It
  works great with hardback and paperback books. This is by far the
  best book light I have ever used</Text>
  <Text category="health">Imagine your eyes closed, and tiny
  vibrating fingers massaging your head and neck. Until you try
  this product, you can't truly imagine how good it feels. Everyone
  deserves a little joy in their day, right?</Text>
  <Text category="health">This product is totally awesome. It works
  great, no problems at all. Since I have mostly carpteting in my
  apartment, I have to move it to a hard surface every time I want
  to use it. It zeros perfectly every time and gives me an accurate
  reading when compared to the doctors scale</Text>
  <Text category="health">I was requested to write a review by
  Amazon. I felt this request was premature since I used this
  product only for a month. So far I am quite satisfied with the
  user friendlyness, price, and ability to use and clean the shaver
  in wet environment.</Text>
  <Text category="health">I love this razor...It gives a nice close
  shave, is easy to clean and can be used wet or dry. Nothing to
  complain about here</Text>
  <Text category="health">I received one of these towels as a gift
  several years ago. It was, by far, one of the best gifts I have
  ever received! It soaks all of the water out of your hair and
  leaves it perfect for blow drying. For women, this is a five star
  gift</Text>
  <Text category="health">This is by far my favorite out of all the
  Odwalla Bars. I used to purchase it at Trader Joe's, but they no
  longer carry this flavor; so I was especially delighted when I
  saw it on Amazon.</Text>
  <Text category="health">I've only used the kit once, and it did
  what it was supposed to. No problems, everything went fine, and I
  intend to use it again within about a month. It should pay for
  itself very quickly</Text>
  <Text category="health">I have medium colored hair, and I've used
  this trimmer many times. It shaves away the hair just fine for
  me, you know need to know how to get to all the hair. If your
  hair is so coarse that this trimmer doesn't work, you I'd
  recommend waxing! Fast, effective, good angling</Text>
  <Text category="health">I have received so many compliments on
  this fragrance. I can always pick out the scent when someone else
  is wearing it. Although a fragrance will smell different on each
  person, I have not known of anyone this one did not work for. I
  guess the negative reviewer is the first I have heard of. I
  highly recommend this to anyone who likes a fresh
  fragrance</Text>
  <Text category="health">Great tasting bar. Nice and soft make it
  easy to eat</Text>
  <Text category="health">i love these bars. i've tried all the
  flavors and they're all pretty darned great. i eat them more for
  a snack than a meal because they aren't as filling as i'd like,
  but they're great for a snack or sugar craving</Text>
  <Text category="health">These were a great deal and they are the
  only diapers, other than Cruisers, that my son doesn't leak
  through.</Text>
  <Text category="health">This is a great lumbar support for crappy
  car and office chairs. Also check out Elaine Petrone's MIRACLE
  BALLS, which you can also use in the car and for other things.
  The support is sturdy and has a mesh back, which helps to keep
  you cool and comfortable. A GREAT deal for the cost</Text>
  <Text category="health">I really liked this product. I am a late
  30's woman whose skin is basically pretty good. I have occasional
  mild breakouts and some blackheads, but even before I bought the
  Neutrogena microdermabrasion I would receive compliments on how
  smooth my skin is. But around age 35 I looked in the mirror and
  realized my skin was getting that middle-age dullness to it.
  Unwilling to pay for a professional microdermabrasion, I decided
  to try the Neutrogena at home system. The Neutrogena
  Microdermabrasion cream is easy to apply. The cream had the
  slightest pleasant smell, and was not sticky at all. I used well
  less than a teaspoon, so a little goes a long way. It was no
  problem to rinse it off my face with water, and the sponge was
  very easy to clean as well. The treatment took me less than 10
  minutes, fit in easily to my bedtime routine, and after the
  initial start-up treatments you only need to do it a couple times
  a week. My skin definitely felt softer, smoother and more
  invigorated. I could notice a difference after only one
  treatment. But the real proof came from the way my husband did a
  double take a couple days later and commented that I looked
  younger. (He didn't know about the microdermabrasion.) And even
  my 6 year old daughter told me my face looked pretty. There was a
  clear and noticeable difference--after only a few treatments my
  middle-aged dull skin had definitely gotten back some of its
  youthful glow, and the few large pores I have did appear smaller.
  Being lazy, I have not incorporated it into my regular routine
  like I should, but I do pull it out a few days before special
  occasions, vacations, or anytime I feel the need for a little
  brightening up, and will definitely always keep it on hand. If
  you have particularly sensitive skin, this may not be a great
  product for you, as it is a bit, well, abrasive. For me, it was a
  painless process, and I would highly recommend it to anyone
  looking to give their skin a more youthful glow</Text>
  <Text category="health">It's all in your technique (which took me
  many trials to learn) If you have had professional
  microdermabrassion then you will know how much scrubbing and
  pressure you will need to apply on your face. The crystals are
  abrasive and if you do not have the proper techniques you will
  hurt your face. I use the crystals in pure form ONCE a week
  (without the vibrating mechanism) BEFORE BEDTIME. These are the
  steps I do that WORK FOR ME. You may have a different system that
  might WORK FOR YOU. 1. Thoroughly wash face with cleanser (I use
  Neutrogena facial liquid soap) and rinse well. 2. While still
  damp, I use crystals to thoroughly exfoliate my face avoiding eye
  area. I go around in QUICK circular motion while applying
  pressure for 1 minute. 3. I rinse quickly and use Neutrogena Deep
  Clean Cream Cleanser to get all the crystals out since crystals
  are difficult to get out(it is also soothing). 4. (Its not over
  yet) After patting my face dry I follow up by using Neutrogena
  Pore Refining Mask. It's a cooling gel that you keep on for 5
  mins to tighten pores. Rinse off and pat dry. 5. I do not put
  anything else on my face before sleeping. My face comes out
  really fresh, soft and smooth. The next morning I just use the
  cream cleanser to wash.</Text>
  <Text category="health">Compared to the first humidifier I got
  from walmart, this cute cow is absolutely quiet and working just
  perfect. Oh, well I just got it yesterday so it's too early to
  say perfect, but considering others' reviews, I am pretty
  confident that I am gonna love it longer than at the first sight.
  The only thing is I don't know where to put it. The power cord
  has to be plugged into a wall socket and the cord is not long. I
  am a little concern that the nearby stuff such as my wood chair
  or chest, or even other electrical appliances will get damaged by
  surrounded with the emitting mist all the time</Text>
  <Text category="health">I have two penguin humidifiers which I
  purchased a couple of months ago. For the money I think these are
  great and simple to use. I did not have any problems with
  leakage--the key is to make sure that the top is on securely.
  Also, some minor dripping is to be expected when you take the
  penguin body off the base--just carry a washcloth with you--no
  problem. Super quiet. I think it is just the right size for a
  bedroom. Easy to clean and fill. I had tried others (honeywell
  and vicks) and this is by far my favorite</Text>

  <Text category="health">I am having the same problem. I ordered
  this product from Amazon on August 26. It is now October 26. I

  else. It is a shame, because Amazon does have the best price I
  have found so far. I gave it 5 stars only because I had to give
  it a rating. I wanted to be fair to the company, but I have
  honestly never used one</Text>
  <Text category="health">This item is great. It holds shampoo and
  conditioner, or whatever liquids you need in the shower, and also
  has a handy basket that I use to keep the shower spray cleaner

  one place. However, I had to buy this item from another vendor
  because Amazon kept delaying shipment. After the delays had
  exceeded a month, I finally cancelled my order and went
  elsewhere. Good product, bad transaction</Text>

  <Text category="health">I bought an epilator because I was tired
  of shaving my legs and waxing was just too expensive for me. I've
  had my epilator for several weeks now and I am already seeing
  amazing results! I used it for the first time on my legs. I'm not
  going to lie...It was painful. I just made sure to go slowly,
  pausing every few inches, and making sure my skin was pulled as
  tightly as I could get it. Eventually, I was able to get most of
  the thick, dark hairs off of my legs. **Please know that the
  Epilator is not an immediate "cure-all". Hair grows in stages, so
  as soon as you get rid of some hairs, several more grow in behind
  them. (Eventually you can probably get rid of most to all of
  them, but it will take some time.) Because of this, it is good to
  try epilating a couple of times a week. Since it's winter, I just
  let it all grow out so that the Epilator can get more hairs.
  However, when new hair grows in, I am finding that they are
  thinner and blonde instead of dark brown. It doesn't hurt nearly
  as much to pull those out! I also know that I'll be able to do
  this in the spring and summer because the hair is lighter. My
  legs are smoother and I don't get razor burn! Right after
  epilating, sometimes I do experience a little irritation but,
  unlike razor burn, it goes away after just a short time. Another
  neat thing is that, unlike waxing, the Epilator can grab the
  teeny tiny almost invisible hairs. This gives your skin a
  smoother feel and it gets hairs at the beginning stages of
  growth! I used to have to wait two weeks or so for my hair to
  grow long enough to be waxed. Now, I get smoother skin just about
  whenever I want to! I was a little nervous at first about
  spending money on a product I had not heard much about. With the
  exception of the few reviews I read online, I was pretty much in
  the dark. I went ahead and went for it, then realized that this
  thing paid for itself in about two weeks! Not only have I
  epilated my legs, I have also used it under my arms, on my upper
  lip, and on my bikini line. The results have been better than I
  could have imagined!! Again, I'm not going to lie...OUCH!!!!!
  Epilating under my arms hurt initially and they were sore for a
  few days (I have very thick hairs). However, I got the majority
  of the hairs and after the first time, I realized that I'm never
  going to have to shave again! Yes, some little blonde hairs grow
  back, but they are ALL thinner and much less painful. In fact,
  sometimes it tickles a little. :o) I epilate there once to twice
  a week (about a five minute job if you're being careful, two if
  you're in a hurry) and I have smoother underarms! I used to get
  my upper lip waxed about once a month. Now I just epilate. It
  hurts, but just for a second. Plus, I keep up with it so instead
  of 50 hairs being pulled at once with hot wax, I only need to
  pull 5-10 each time. **A word of caution: Our skin is more
  sensitive in some areas, so if you choose to epilate around the
  bikini line, be careful. I managed to give myself a burn from
  going too slowly with the rotating "blade". Now I just make sure
  that I don't leave it in one place for more than a couple of
  seconds. If I miss some hairs, I come back another time to get
  them. This epilator comes with a little loufa pad to help reduce
  ingrown hairs (I've only had a few and the pad fixes them) and a
  little cleaning brush. The epilator is very easy to clean. The
  top (dark purple section) pops off and you run it under hot
  water. When it dries, you put it back on. **Note, the epilator
  does not store hairs inside of it. When they are pulled out, they
  tend to either gather on the front of the epilator (I stop
  periodically to wipe them off) or they go flying. I sit on a
  towel when epilating to catch most of the hairs. I hope this
  review was helpful to you with your decision about buying an
  epilator. I am very satisfied with this product and I recommend
  it to anyone who has at least a little pain tolerance and really
  wants to get rid of hair stop having to shave all the time. **Are
  the few minutes of pain worth it??? ABSOLUTELY! :o)</Text>

  <Text category="health">By far, the best hair straightener I have
  purchased. I have spent so much time, money and effort searching
  for a straightener that delivers results. I can now say that I

  my course, naturally curly hair. One of my all time, favorite

  <Text category="health">I've had this product for almost a year
  now. I have very thick, frizzy, hair and have spent my life
  getting it relaxed every six months, and blowing drying it

  never handle my hair. But with this one, I have not needed a blow
  dryer since I got it! Now my hair is straighter than it has ever
  been in my life, which I thought I would never see. Of course
  this makes it very straight so I can't get any shape or curls
  from it(which is what I was going for). Cut my drying time by
  almost 2 hours (as long as I apply some protective serum on when
  still wet). Great product and still going strong.</Text>
  <Text category="health">I decided to buy this product before i
  read the reviews. In my opinion the trays stay on better than the
  strip kind. There is alot of whitening goo that you press into
  your teeth and it helps the trays stay in place. The first
  morning the goo came totally out of my bottom tray but that was
  becuase i pressed too hard. I havent had the problem since. I
  noticed a difference after 3 days and they are much whiter after
  7 days. My gums turned white if the whitening goo touched them
  for the full 45 minutes and felt tingly and hurt slightly. The
  pick color returned within an hour. It really isnt as bad as the
  other reviewers make it seem. All in all if you are looking for a
  product that works, this is a good one. I was truly surprised at
  how well they worked. I will be purchasing these in the

  <Text category="health">This model has all the features of the
  Elite 9500 (2 brush heads, 2 cleaning modes, programmable
  quadpacer, and a guage to indicate about how much charge is
  remaining in the battery), but it's $12 cheaper from Amazon! All
  the "programmable quadpacer" feature amounts to is the ability to
  leave it on for an extra (i.e., a fifth) 30-second interval, or
  the ability to turn the timer off so that it's just on/off. I
  regard most of the features as functional ornamentation ("bells
  and whistles"), but the Elite 9800 also happens to be a
  dependable, super-lightweight model that will run a good three
  weeks on a charge with only one person using it. I went on a
  three-week trip and didn't bother to pack my charger, and it had
  charge to spare when I got back. NOTE: I always allow the NiCd
  battery run all the way down (to exhaustion) before charging it,
  and that enhances both the charge and battery life. (NiCd's only
  have so many charge cycles.) If this is your first electric, you
  might like the way it comes out of the box programmed to
  gradually ramp-up the power over the first fourteen brushings.
  What's the difference between the 9800 and the 9500? The models
  appear identical. The only difference I found is that one comes
  in a box that says 9800, the other says 9500. :-)</Text>
  <Text category="health">This is my second Norelco Wet Shaver. So,
  yes, I like the product. Here's my rundown: Pluses: - Good shave
  - Less razor burn - lot easier to insert packets (compared to my
  older model) - easy to clean Minuses: - Hard to get that "patch"
  under your nose - Have to switch out an add-on to get sideburns
  straight - battery/power seem to wane at times - packets are
  expensive I'm a cheap SOB, so here's my way of stretching out the
  life of the packets. Wet your face first with hot water, rinse
  your shaver with hot water and then squeeze out the lotion. Do a
  first pass shave. Rinse the shaver and do a second pass without
  the lotion with a wet face/shaver. Keep a blade on-hand to get
  the under-the-nose patch and your sideburns. All-in-all doner

  <Text category="health">I have tried many contact lens solutions,
  and this one works the best for me. Since switching to Acuvue 2
  disposable lenses a couple of years ago, I noticed that my eyes
  did not maintain their moisture as well as with my former daily

  lenses in saline, but the OptiFree is truly different for me,
  helping to clean my lenses daily and seemingly helping to
  maintain their flexibility and comfort all day. Although I still
  rinse the OptiFree off of my lenses with saline before wearing
  them, I have found no irritation. And, even better, daily rinsing
  and overnight storage in the OptiFree help me to extend the life
  of my disposable lenses for several weeks beyond what I could
  without using it. That saves money because I have to purchase
  lenses less frequently. Give it a try, especially at this price!

  <Text category="health">And now a word from David Lynch, as
  spoken by Dean Stockwell as Doctor Yueh in DUNE: "The tooth. The
  tooooootttttttth. Remember the tooth." Seriously, my daughter
  loves Dora the Explorer and my goals are to get her to brush her
  teeth for longer than two minutes. I bought this Dora the
  Explorer battery powered electric toothbrush, and she does. Game.
  Set. Match. Best money I ever spent on simultaneous child and
  parent satisfaction. When I tested this model on my finger, I was
  surprised at how powerful it was for a child-sized unit. This
  electric toothbrush decidedly will not rip her little gums off
  her skull, but the teeth definitely get a good scrubbing. Battery
  life is okay, I estimate it costs about &#239;&#191;&#189; a cent
  for her to brush her teeth each time. The future value of that
  expenditure is far lower than the dental bills I'd otherwise
  have, so this is a money saving unit. If your child in a member
  of the Dora cultus, this is one of the better items to own</Text>

  <Text category="health">To start - I miss my hair. Last september
  I cut my hip length hair to mid back, and then in december to
  just at the shoulders, and then again to the chin in January -
  and from January through June I trimmed it regularly to keep it
  that length. (I've been getting rid of the henna that was in my
  hair - I couldn't get it out via any other method tried except
  "growing out"). My hair grows kinda slow now too - it used to
  grow faster, but I suppose everything slows down the older you
  get. My last cut was late June - and it was at mid to upper neck
  length - basically a little bit longer than the chin length cut,
  and then layered. That got rid of the really saturated henna'd
  hair - so I was ready to start growing it out. After much digging
  around online I came across hair 37 and all the reviews on it -
  both good and bad. I gave it a shot - got my pills in the first
  week of July and started taking them. Last night - maybe it was
  wishful thinking, but I noticed a difference in the hair length -
  it seemed it'd picked up a little length a little extra quickly -
  and then my boyfriend commented on it later that day. He knows
  I've been working to go back to my natural hair color - and
  there's a noticeable demarcation line from the henna and the
  natural hair color. Last night he looked at me and said "Hey wow
  - you're hair's really grown - I can see a half inch more of the
  roots! Wow - you're hair is getting dark!" I was pretty pleased
  with that - not bad for just 2 weeks on the vitamins! I can't
  wait to see how it is in another 2 weeks, come August - if I have
  another 1/2 inch to add to it, I will definitely be reordering
  these pills! But a side note, from previous reviews and my own
  experience... it's a lot of pills to take - but make sure you
  keep up with them every day. I find taken a stage one pill at
  morning and afternoon, and then dividing up the stage 2 pills
  into 3 doses of 2 pills throughout the day works very
  well.</Text>
  <Text category="health">Hi, I'm not a "review" person, but when I
  read the existing reviews, I felt like doing this. I used this
  product for 2 months and I must tell you that it really WORKS!
  I'm hispanic-black woman (dominican) with relaxed fine hair and
  my hair grows normally, but only neck-chin lenght, no further
  than that. With this product I achieved a maximum growth rate and
  now my hair is leaving behind the accustomed lenght. I bought
  again the product to see how longer it can grows!!! I've been
  completely sincere with you...I'm not a staffer of this product
  company, I'm a real and very happy user!!! Hope this comment will
  be helpful for other women. I have only one last thing to say:
  Try it!!!! It worked for me..</Text>

  <Text category="health">I am in my early 30's and have been

  chin and cheeks for the past couple of years. I have tried Murad,
  Proactiv, AcneFree and many other systems without success. A
  month ago I picked up the Neutrogena system when I saw it on
  sale. Within five days days my skin started to clear. Now, I have
  a completely clear complexion and have not had a single break-out
  since starting the system. I have had no problems with drying and
  my skin is much softer than before. Finally, a product that works

  <Text category="health">This is the best affordable acne solution
  that ive ever used. I had acne on my forehead and the acne
  started to get smaller and even the acne on my cheeks just
  disappeared the next morning. On the box there is a sticker that
  said that it works faster than proactiv solution and its right!
  Proactiv takes like 2 weeks to work but this works over night.
  The only minor thing about it is when you put on the overnight
  acne control lotion, it starts feeling like its harding into a
  mask on your face. It feels like its restricing muscle movement
  on your face. Its no biggy because it works and it washes right
  off in the morning when im in the shower. I cant believe a little
  lotion can make such a difference. If you are looking for acne
  solution at a affordable price then this is exacly what you are
  looking for</Text>
  <Text category="health">I have seen these in catalogs before
  &amp;amp; didn't give them a second thought. Then one day when I
  was cleaning under &amp;amp; around all of my shampoo bottles,
  etc in the shower, it hit me that one of these might just
  consolidate all the shampoos/conditions &amp;amp; body wash that
  I have collected in my shower. So, I ordered one a higher price
  &amp;amp; I am so thrilled that I am ordering one for the kids'
  bathroom where I had hubby put in an extra shelf just to hold all
  the shampoos etc. Now it will all be in one place, not messy
  &amp;amp; out of the reach of my toddler! The other thing that I
  have noticed is that I don't use nearly as much shampoo as I did
  before - I get a few squirts &amp;amp; if that isn't enough, I
  get more - no more dumping a handfull of shampoo in my hand. I
  know I use far less shampoo than I did before I had this so I am
  no longer wasting it! This is just the greatest concept &amp;amp;
  this product is very easy to keep clean &amp;amp; it works
  &amp;amp; looks great in the shower. I would recommend this
  product to anyone! &amp;amp; if you don't think you will fill up
  all four sections - get a smaller one but I found the 4 section
  one is just what I needed; one for clarifying shampoo, one for
  conditioning shampoo, one for conditioner &amp;amp; one for body
  wash. No more bars or shampoos cluttering my bathroom</Text>
  <Text category="health">This dispenser is easy to install and
  works perfectly every time. After initially filling the
  dispensers, it took several pumps for the product to dispense but
  after that it comes out on the first push of the button. It has
  been very convenient in my shower and no more shampoo bottles all
  over the shower! It also saves on my shampoo because the kids
  just push the button twice to dispense the amount they need
  instead of pouring shampoo out of the bottles and using more than
  they need</Text>
  <Text category="health">Used to have a lot of liquid soap and
  shampoo get washed down the drain by my two kids... kids will be
  kids... but now they really like having their own dispenser

  <Text category="health">I received this for Christmas from my
  Amazon Wishlist. I wanted to give it a couple of months of use
  before reviewing. I was a long time user of Norelco shavers, but
  switched to a blade since I couldn't get a close enough shave.
  Now that the whiskers are mostly gray, you can't tell for a few
  days if I shaved or not, so closeness is no longer an issue. I
  typically use this shaver in the shower, and have noticed that if
  you wash your face first, it takes more of the Cool Skin creme to
  give a smooth, close shave. Just a hint, guys. For the most part
  this shaver does a good job of getting around the wrinkles,
  dimples and Adam's apple cleanly with very little drag. My only
  complaint is that the trimmer head is a separate attachment and
  that makes it difficult to trim the 'stash &amp;amp; sideburns
  while showering. Small complaint that doesn't remove any ratings
  stars. All in all a great shaver</Text>
  <Text category="health">(....). It takes some getting used to,
  but after a couple of weeks it provides a very comfortable shave.
  I got razor burn on my neck for the first couple weeks, but I
  think I was pressing too hard like I had to with my old razor.
  Just a light touch gives a close shave. The attachable sideburn
  trimmer doesn't do a very good job in my opinion, but I kept my
  old razor that worked better for that purpose. The gel packs go
  pretty quickly, but maybe I'm using too much. I'm still trying to
  get the hang of it. It's a different experience than your basic
  razor</Text>
  <Text category="health">This shaver replaced a Norelco Advantage
  (6 years old) that was shaving good but would no longer hold a
  charge for more than a couple of days. I can't honestly say if it
  shaves as close as a blade because I haven't shaved with a blade
  in many years. I have used foil shavers in the past (Braun and
  Panasonic) and though they might shave closer than a rotary the
  cost to replace the foils and the nicks that you get is not worth
  it. I have been using this shaver for about 3 months. During that
  time I have charged it only twice including the initial charge
  and that is using it at least every other day. At first I thought
  it was underpowered because it is so quiet but soon found out
  that it shaves much closer than my old Advantage which I thought
  was doing a great job. It shaves quick and close ( Personally I
  think as close as a blade). When you are done shaving you just
  rinse it under the tap and let it dry. It doesn't get any easier
  than that. I have cleaned the heads once as stated in the
  instructions and that is easy too. The only con is I have dry
  sensitive skin and have not seen any difference between the 3
  comfort settings. Use electric shave before shaving and I think
  that you will agree that it shaves as close as a blade without
  the irritation. Highly recommended and worth the price.</Text>
  <Text category="health">I ordered this parfum because it is
  really cheap. I received it 4 days after ordering, delivered very

  <Text category="health">Replacement blades are a must. The razor
  will remind you about once a year which is fine in most cases.
  But, if you have a heavy beard or shave more than once a day, as
  I do, then you should replace the blades every 8 months or so.
  The reminder on the razor is only a suggestion, not a command.
  After all, it does not know when the blades get dull. So, I
  simply ignore the reminder and replace the blades when I feel it
  is necessary. One thing you must do is use the new blades for
  several days until they settle in and adjust to your skin. Until
  then you may have a little irritation. Another problem I have
  solved is the hair on my neck. I use to think the harder I press
  the razor, the better it would get those stray hairs. But, all I
  got was a rash. I discovered that if I simply use a very light
  touch and not press hard then it got those hairs much better and
  with no redness. Replace your blades at least once a year and
  your face with thank you</Text>

  <Text category="health">My fiance (now wife) and I have been
  looking for a workable solution for the hair down under. She has
  tried waxing - too painful - and shaving would cause a lot of
  bumps and irritation, even with the Shick Intutition. Her pubic
  region was basically living on Neosporen, Bikini Zone, and Gold
  Bond (not together and not in any particular order). We also
  tried scissors, but that was hard to negotiate, if you will, in
  the more intimate of areas. At this point she was seriously
  thinking laser hair removal, but wasn't ready to pony up the $$
  and commit to an irrevocable decision. Although, based on the
  other posts here and accepted fashion trends, I highly doubt that
  an "au natural massive overgrowth" will be in style. The trimmer
  is great. Yes, Amazon should take down the photo of the storage
  pouch. Yes, it won't get you totally smooth or bald. But it is a
  well built TRIMMER, which is painless and easy to use. You can
  adjust the length you want, and you can easily work around the
  more sensitive and intimate southern locations. Just take it easy
  around the labia minora and remember to use a mirror. If you want
  the smooth look, use this handy device before you break out the
  razor and shaving cream/lotion. It makes it much easier and cuts
  down on irritation. I suppose, although we have no interest in
  it, that you can get creative with styling your pubic hair into
  shapes and designs. Hey what ever works for you and/or you an
  your partner</Text>
  <Text category="health">I take two of this product before bed and
  it relaxes me and helps me sleep</Text>
  <Text category="health">The satin finish and the design are very
  attractive. I had to pump each chamber about 100 times to get it
  primed but after that it worked great. You might want to prime it
  with water instead of shampoo to get things going. The
  directions, which I lost, said something about priming.
  Installation was easy. It includes both glue or 4 short adhesive
  strips. I went with the adhesive strips and it seems secure. I
  figured if I ever have to remove it, I could just pull it off and
  use Goof Off to remove the adhesive. If you fill one of the
  chambers with body soap, I recommend Neutrogena Rainbath
  Refreshing Shower and Bath Gel, Original Formula and a natural
  sponge. I bought a synthetic sponge that looks like a natural one
  at Wal-Mart and it's a little rough</Text>
  <Text category="health">I bought this to try it out based on a
  friend's recommendation. Previously I'd always packed a couple
  old ratty towels with the dog's stuff before heading to the lake
  or the beach. Now I only need one towel and it dries like you'd
  never believe. I have a 65 pound dog that loves the water. I make
  him shake the water off himself (a trick as important as sit or
  lay down when you have a dog this big) then I towel him dry in
  less than a minute. I now own 3 of these towels and have
  purchased them for just about anyone I know with a dog that gets
  wet. We live in Seattle so not only are we surrounded by lakes
  other bodies of water, but we have rainy winters. Having one of
  these towels hanging behind the door with the coats was a god
  send this winter as well. I can't speak enough praise about this
  towel. Though a $30 pricetag for a meer towel could seem
  daunting, believe me when I tell you this is worth it. You'll end
  up buying two</Text>
  <Text category="health">Okay, I haven't owned a new hair dryer
  for over 25 years, but I must say, this one is exactly perfect
  and has everything I would ever want in a hair dryer. It has a
  retractible chord and is and dries my hair quickly, leaving it
  soft and frizz-free. I highly recommend this product</Text>
  <Text category="health">The best price around for this type
  massager. Price was my main reason for the purchase. Mine does
  heat up, but the massager does have to be running for a few
  minutes before you notice it. The programmable feature is nice as
  well as the many variable speeds. I would highly recommend
  it.</Text>
  <Text category="health">Just received this massager and my wife
  and I can't stop massaging each other with it. Especially great
  deal for the special Amazon price. I've been wanting one of these
  for years because I can hardly feel those little hand held ones
  (that just fit in the palm of your hand). Glad I splurged. Only
  problem is that Amazon site says "7 heads", Item description says
  "6 heads", and actul product only included 5 heads. The one
  missing, from the picture on the box, is the "Acu Point" heads.
  I'm guessing that's why it's on sale? Still worth it if you get
  it on sale. Great massager.</Text>
  <Text category="health">I have tried lots of protein powders. I
  get online the low-carb, low-calorie protein powders as I am just
  trying to put on muscle and it is hard to find one that you can
  stomach. I was stuck on Champions Whey (Chocolate) for the past
  year as the best but I just got my shipment of the Gold Standard
  - Cookies &amp;amp; Cream and it is AMAZING! I love this stuff. I
  tried it with fat free milk in just a shaker bottle and it was
  tremendous. I am going to have this before and after my daily
  workout, but best yet, rather than binging on any ice cream
  desires late at night, I am going to get a scoop of fat free
  frozen vanilla yogurt, put a scoop of this in with some fat free
  milk and I have my fat free protein shake</Text>
  <Text category="health">I've used hot air brushes for a couple
  years. This works better than my last. The low setting and the
  larger brush works better for me. The high setting blows the hair
  off the bristles. It's nice having the small brush option for
  different styles though. I believe my hair stays styled longer
  and without as much work and injuries using a hot air brush
  versus a curling iron</Text>
  <Text category="health">So far, these fit the bill. Just used
  them for the first time--find that they are easy to put on, and
  comfortable--and better yet, don't interfere with jewelry as they
  would if they hung off a chain/rope/string</Text>
  <Text category="health">Very convenient to use. However, since

  <Text category="health">I have to write a review for the below
  review (the one I have in quotes). The below reviewer states this
  is 170 Watts and you need 1875 watts. I nearly fell off my seat!
  Not only by the review but by how many people recommended it!
  FIRST, 100 watts is average for a hair straighter. 170 watts is
  excellent! 1875 would melt your hair! I did not think it was fair
  that this person rated the item without having knowledge on
  wattage. "This straightener only has 170 watts of heating power.
  That is not a very good number! If you want salon-straight hair
  you need a ceramic straightener with 1875 watts... especially if
  you have thick or very frizzy hair!</Text>
  <Text category="health">I love this straightener! I have had two
  other straighteners including one from a salon that cost over $80
  and this one works much better then either of the other two. All
  my friends also love it and are always asking to barrow it</Text>
  <Text category="health">I never thought that I could get my hair
  straight enough to actually like it. Until I found this VS
  Sassoon straightener. It is THE BEST!! I use it all the time and
  I love the way that it makes my hair look shiny and feel feather
  soft. I would tell anyone with wavy or curly hair who wants super
  straight, soft hair, to use this product. You can't go
  wrong!</Text>
  <Text category="health">I used this product and can't say enough
  good things about it. My friend bought it for me for my birthday

  and I was never hungry. I ate at restaurants and always managed
  to find a perfect menu in my DietMate. I love it. thank yo</Text>

  <Text category="health">I bought this vaporizer several weeks
  ago. I feel better after I use this. It created steam very fast
  (about 2-3 minutes after plugging). You may have to fill some
  salt to make it create a lot of steam. However, a lot of steam
  means the water will decrease rapidly so if you want to use this

  <Text category="health">My first Aquis mitt was rectangular. I
  like this one better. Rounding the edges makes sense since it is
  meant to be worn on the hand. Aquis microfiber is the only fabric
  I use on my face. It is gentle on the skin, yet cleans more
  thoroughly than anything else I have used. (I find it amazing
  that both attributes apply to the same fabric!) If the
  manufacturer is listening, I would like to be able to buy the
  mitts in sets of 2. This would be perfect for bathing
  baby/children. There is a slit in the seam, on the thumb side, so
  your thumb can protrude. You can grip/lift without removing your
  mitts. Some size choices (S/M &amp;amp; L/XL) would be nice, as
  this mitt would not fit a large man's han</Text>
  <Text category="health">The roller balls are excellent! The
  rolling action and three different speeds are excellent as well.
  The only drawback is the mesh over the pillow. It is abrasive to
  the skin. I have had to put a thin pillow case on top of it and
  that solved the problem. The only other problem is it has a hard
  area where your head lies so you must make sure you are situated
  properly. Other than that, it is the best machine on the market I
  have found and I have tried many</Text>
  <Text category="health">Casein is a great, long-lasting protein,
  perfect for right before bed as its aminos are release more
  slowly than whey. Casein, in general, is bland (think no fat, no
  salt, cottage cheese), and harder to mix than whey. Optimum
  Nutrition has here a decent casein, that is not too bad tasting
  and mixes better than most every other casein I've tried. The
  price is ok, but I'd like to see it cheaper (who wouldn't?). I
  mix it with whey and use it throughout the day. I have tried and
  rejected the chocolate flavor</Text>
  <Text category="health">Yes it is pricey but worth it. I tried
  the Gilette skin care and liked it. At that point, $5 bucks for
  1.7 ounces felt crazy. So when I bought this I thought I must be
  mad. But for my skin it works fantastic. It also has the distinct
  advantage of how it dispenses. You get a controlled amount unlike
  a tube by pressing down on the top. Yes you can not see how much
  is left. But I have had tubes that are not clear and you are in
  the same boat. At least here you have the best possible non-clear
  dispenser you could get. I have always had good skin so I do not
  need that much to have good results. It is not greasy nor does it
  have much of a fragerence. It leaves my skin feeling smooth and
  has made shaving easier and smoother. Probably the Q10 is a bunch
  of hype. And yes I usually buy Sauve or 'Swiss formula' which are
  much less pricey. I can get 2 months out of 1.7 ounces. Under $4
  a month to feel great and help protect my skin? Worth it to
  me</Text>
  <Text category="health">I've had other razors and believe me,
  this one is the most reliable on I've had! It works well, does
  NOT hurt? (maybe the people who had one that pinches or hurts
  them got a bad one?) A feature I like and use often is the head
  pops up to cut longer hair...unfortunately at times I need this
  before I use the regular cutter. Battery life is acceptable,
  power is good, and just a few swipes is all you need. You really
  can't compare a blade razor to an electric- they are not yet
  comparable for cutting or time used. This razor, however, has a
  better level of shaving than other electrics, closer to a blade
  than the others. In convenience an electric is much better than
  any blade- you can use it anywhere, dry, just sittin'
  around</Text>
  <Text category="health">Amazon still hasn't quite figured out how
  to ship these... mine arrived with one case broken open, although
  the whole thing had been stuffed in a clear garbage bag</Text>
  <Text category="health">I have Pergo and cannot get it too wet or
  the floor will bubble. The Swiffer Wet cloths are the perfect
  solution. They're so incredibly easy to use and there are no

  consuming a product that is so disposable, but at the same time,
  it works so well</Text>
  <Text category="health">Adds a great fragrance to the room. We
  bought several different scents and placed them throughout the
  house. It's a different smell in every room. What a pleasant
  change from smelling the pets.</Text>
  <Text category="health">This was almost too strong for me at
  first. I put it on the lower level of the house and it took away
  that "basement" smell for months. I was impressed with the
  "throw" this thing had. I would definitely repurchase.</Text>
  <Text category="health">I bought this item because I was going to
  Europe for a month. I didn't want the hassle of using a voltage
  converter because you can only use one electric item at a time,
  unless you buy more than one converter kit. You do need a plug
  adaptor, (these are relatively inexpensive), then you just switch
  the voltage, plug it in and it works great. I used it in
  Switzerland, France and Italy. When I came home to the States I
  just switched the voltage back and I now use it at home. It is
  small and takes up very little space in the suitcase. I would
  recommend it for anyone in need of a hair dryer traveling
  abroad</Text>
  <Text category="health">I purchased this hair dryer for an
  unusual reason: my old 1875 watt Conair was actually too much
  wattage for my bathroom (the circuit kept tripping), so I was
  actually looking for a dryer with LESS wattage. However, I didn't
  want to sacrifice power, as I hoped not to have to devote any
  additional drying time to my shoulder-length hair. So far, I've
  been pleased with this hair dryer. It does seem a bit louder than
  my previous model--not obnoxiously so, just a higher, more
  concentrated fan noise. The dryer is extremely light and compact;
  it's actually smaller than my folding travel dryer. It is very
  basic, with a choice of high/low settings only (there is no
  heat/cool option), but it seems to dry my hair just as
  efficiently as my old higher-wattage dryer. Overall, this is a
  very good basic hair dryer which gives you a wide variety of use
  options for a great price</Text>
  <Text category="health">This is a great little dryer if you
  travel, or just for home use.Well worth the price.

  <Text category="health">Compared to the Conair 1,600W I have used
  for the past seven years or so it sounded incredibly loud and
  high-pitched when I first turned it on, but you may have a
  high-pitched blow dryer now--compared to my old Conair--and won't
  notice a difference. It doesn't have a cold air feature, which
  many women use regularly to either finish off their styling or to
  cause less damage to the hair; or like me, in the summer when the
  option of switching from hot to cold is preferable. These two
  drawbacks, especially having only the hot at high or low setting,
  is why I give it four out of five, instead of five out of five
  star rating. Pluses: price--for $13 it can't be beat for the
  frugal shopper; efficiency--it blowdries my hair a bit faster
  than the Conair did though I don't understand the science behind
  that; appearance--it's cute and compact; weight--a toddler could
  wield this blow-dryer with ease; carrying ease--small enough to
  fit neatly in just about any drawer or a crammed gym bag, under
  the sink, et cetera. I haven't had this long enough to rate how
  durable it is, so I hope someone who's owned one for at least a
  year comes on to write, "it's still going strong.</Text>
  <Text category="health">This is an exceptional value for an
  exceptional dryer. I have paid alot more for more well known,

  <Text category="health">I have been very satisfied with the
  monitor. It is easy to use and seems to be quite accurate. I was
  disappointed to find when I opened the box that there were no

  time, etc. All-in-all it is a quite satisfactory device</Text>
  <Text category="health">I have used the unit for about two weeks,
  with NiMH rechargable batteries installed, and it performs as
  advertised. There is, in my opinion, a design flaw: the

  easily depressed at unwanted times, e.g. putting into or removing
  from the case. They could/should have included an AC
  adapter</Text>

  <Text category="health">I purchased the Sound Therapy Radio to

  and clock are added goodies for me as I was looking for a sound
  machine that was small and light enough for travel. It was a good
  buy for my purposes.</Text>
  <Text category="health">I like the portability and adjustability
  of this mirror. It takes up little space and can be stowed away
  very compactly. It serves my needs very well. I was disappointed
  that only the magnifying mirror is lit. I tend to use the normal

  I stow it away. It has to be reset and left out if you were
  really wanting to use the clock feature. As far as I am
  concerned...I was looking for a mirror and really could care less
  about the clock</Text>
  <Text category="health">My husband and I love this thermometer
  for our own use - let alone the grandkids! It's fast, easy, and
  reliable. Highly recommend it</Text>
  <Text category="health">I tried the ear thermometers and NEVER
  could get them to work. Our pediatrician used one of these "rub
  across the forehead" kind at her office during a checkup and said
  it was as accurate as the ear kind and MUCH easier to use ...
  especially when kids have earaches (... grabbing an itty-bitty
  earlobe and sticking that hard end into the swollen, sore ear
  canal??? ... ouch.) With a minute's practice (after reading the
  instructions), you get the hang of using it and never dread
  checking temperatures again</Text>
  <Text category="health">I have been using this razor for about 6
  years now, probably as long as they have been out. They may be
  pricey but well worth it. I used to use disposables and
  nicked/cut my legs almost every time. I switched to these and
  have maybe nicked my legs very little. It is so quick and easy to
  use, and my legs are much smoother than they ever were with
  disposables and shaving creams. They do only last for 3-5 shaves,
  but if you figure in the price of disposables and shaving cream,
  it's probably not that much more expensive</Text>
  <Text category="health">This has helped my wife and I to lower
  our cholesterol. I take it in conjunction with Red Yeast Rice
  Extract(this must be taken at night) because my numbers are very
  high. My wife's numbers are right on borderline. We took blood
  tests before and after using it and have seen great improvements.
  My numbers went down 37 points in a few months and my wife's
  numbers went down about half of mine. (I also take double the
  dose she does.) It's a great way to keep healthy, naturally. My
  father-in-law started using it and has seen improvements, also.
  His dangerous PSA numbers (prostrate) even dropped radically. We
  don't know if that was due to the fish oil-but he believes it
  was. His dr. said he'd never seen numbers drop that much. We tell
  just about everyone we know about it.</Text>
  <Text category="health">Recommend it. Suppressed my appetite the
  first day. When I got hungry it took a few bytes to feel full
  again</Text>
  <Text category="health">I just started taking this pill because I
  don't have time to eat at the job I was previously at. It helped
  a lot!! I did lose 8 pound in 1 week. But when I started an
  office job, I had more than enough time to eat, but I still kept
  up with taking the pill. It helps with my hunger, it really does.
  I used to be so hungry and fill up my plate more than I can eat!
  Now since taking this pill I am sensible with my portions and do
  not rush to eat as if I'm starving like before. I agree with one
  of the reviews, if you still eat when you're not hungry, this
  pill will not help you. You have to have the in mind that you
  want to help yourself eat better, slower and sensible
  portions.</Text>
  <Text category="health">I have not been overweight for many
  years, but I still have that last 5-10 pounds that just will not
  stay off. I have several issues with eating - I tend to eat very
  large portions when I am really enjoying a meal, I snack a lot,
  and I have a major sweet tooth. This product has taken care of
  all 3 problems. I am currently taking 1000 mg 3 times a day. I
  plan to cut back a little once I'm at my target weight. I find
  that this dosage will generally suppress my appetite and/or urge
  to eat for 3-6 hours. It's odd for me to experience hunger
  without cravings and a frantic urge to eat...but that's what the
  pills do for me. Most of the time I can tell I'm hungry only
  because my stomach is growling and it has been several hours
  since my last meal...but I don't feel like I have to eat anything
  right away. I can go grocery shopping when I'm hungry and not
  make poor choices, and even when I finish up at the gym after
  work I don't feel ravenous anymore. I definitely get full faster.
  It doesn't feel like it used to when I overate, I just can tell
  I've eaten enough and I stop. What a concept! And often I can
  just have a bite or two and be good for another 30-60 min if I'm
  too busy to sit down and eat. My urge to snack has really been
  curbed. I still have one or two snacks most days, but they are
  much smaller and often more healthy. Now I can actually stay up
  several hours past dinner without making another mini-meal, which
  I used to do almost every night. Hoodia does not completely kill
  my appetite, it suppresses it quite a bit but more than anything
  it takes away all of my cravings. That is definitely my favorite
  part - I used to crave sugar from morning until night practically
  every day. Since my first day on these pills, the only time I've
  had sweets is when someone has offered me something. I'm able to
  eat just a little and not wish for ten times more. It does not
  occur to me to go to the vending machine at work anymore, or buy
  candy when I'm shopping. Maybe even more than the weight loss,
  the emotional benefits of these pills are incredible for me. I'm
  no longer berating myself constantly for overeating or having too
  much candy or dessert. I'm not depressed all day anymore because
  my favorite pants have gotten snug, and all I can think about is
  why I don't have the willpower to prevent it. I would DEFINITELY
  recommend this product, especially to anyone who has issues with
  food like I do</Text>
  <Text category="health">This protein is unbelievable. I have
  tried *many* different brands/varieties and this is without a
  doubt one of the best out there. It doesn't have the
  characteristic nausiating whey smell or taste, it's not too
  sweet, mixes lump-free in cold or piping hot water and packs a
  punch with 23g of easily digestable protein per scoop. Once you
  try it, this stuff will definitely become a staple in your
  pantry.</Text>
  <Text category="health">It cost a little more, but it's worth it.
  It keeps the last 5 temperatures so you can compare</Text>
  <Text category="health">I have a preemie who's temperature needs
  to be monitored pretty much constantly. At every diaper change we
  were taking axial temps with one of those standard digital
  thermometers. TORTURE! Took forever and baby screamed her head
  off the whole time. Then my sister got this thermometer for us
  and it is fabulous. What we like: 1. When baby is screaming, the
  light blinks and then goes solid when temp is done, great when
  you can't hear the beep. 2. It truly does take a second unless
  baby is thrashing about. 3. Produces a long beep when you are
  taking your own temperature, no guesswork about when it's
  finished which is an improvement over earlier models. What we
  don't like: 1. Preemies have TINY ear holes. So we have had to
  wait till our baby's ear was big enough to be able to use this
  thing. 2. The lens covers are a pain to switch out and keep on
  hand, it would be nice if there were a way to just sanitize the
  lens after each use. 3. We see a discrepancy of almost one degree
  between the left and right ear which makes us question the
  accuracy somewhat. The enclosed brochure explains various causes
  of this, but that doesn't help when trying to determine what
  exactly your baby's temperature is. We have done both the axial
  and ear temp and found that the right ear on our baby corresponds
  with the digital thermometer's reading on her armpit. However,
  the enclosed chart shows the variances between oral, rectal,
  axial, and ear temperatures which make it somewhat confusing. So
  we alternate between the digital and the ear thermometer just to
  be sure. I personally WOULD recommend this thermometer for older
  babies and kids, just be sure that you test it out when kids are
  healthy to figure out your baseline and what is normal. It takes
  some investigation to develop your method based on what your
  needs are, but it is a nice, quick to use product and my family
  LOVES using it for adult temperature readings. We think we will
  be happier with it when baby is bigger and we are using it for
  sick readings only</Text>
  <Text category="health">As a tape measure, it does what it says
  it does. You press a button and the tape tightens around your
  body part. You won't have to worry about, "Did I hold the tape
  tigher last time?" as the tension is always the same for
  consistent measurements every time. The tape starts measurement
  at 2" since the tape casing holds the tape and that part measures
  around 2 inches. I think this tape is accurate plus-or-minus
  half-an-inch but it sure beats a regular tape measure since at
  least the button ensures that each time the tape wraps around you
  at the same tension level</Text>

  <Text category="health">I was amazed at how well this device

  this system. It works</Text>
  <Text category="health">First of all, let me say this product is
  great in almost every way. So if you need to feel better about
  your nose and/or throat, go for it. My main complain about the
  Grossan Hydro Pulse is that it is noticeably expensive. Some time
  ago, Grossan was making just his own irrigator tip matching it to
  a Waterpik machine that cost a half the price of the Hydro Pulse.
  But then, Grossan decided to produce his own machine and, if I'm
  right, Viajet is making it for him. Viajet sells the same
  machine, except for the Grossan tip, at about -again- a half the
  price of the Hydro Pulse. The Breathe-ease solution that you
  might use along with the irrigator is also expensive (I have
  check this comparing it with a simillar product that can be
  purchased in my country). So what makes the Hydro Pulse so
  expensive? Maybe health is a business, after all. Other than
  that, like I have said, this product is great for almost any
  respiratory problem. I used to irrigate my nose with a similar
  solution that comes in a 135 ml bottle, and is intended to use it
  over 50 times. The Hydro Pulse lets you do a 500 ml clean
  everytime, so you get the idea. Also, if you are suffering
  respiratory problems and want to chek an interesting drug-free
  treatment, look for the Buteyko Method</Text>
  <Text category="health">Product is exactly what you would expect.
  I have been using it for 2 months 3-5 times a day with great
  success. I would buy it again knowing how well it works</Text>
  <Text category="health">I'm not a sucker for advertising and I'm
  definitely not an impulse buyer. But I did purchase a Schick
  Quattro razor some time ago to replace my old, tired blade. And
  I've been satisfied thoroughly with it. However, after needing
  some refills, I bought these Titanium Coated Blades. Wow. I
  didn't believe it at first but I actually took a new titanium
  blade and the regular Schick blades and (I can't believe I'm
  about to confess this...) did one of those hokey "side-by-side"
  tests. This blade is excellent. It is an upgrade above their
  standard blade and, to me, worth the difference in price</Text>
  <Text category="health">I've owned this item for about a year and
  it works great. Comfortble to sleep several days in a row on and
  never had a problem with it deflating. I recommend this
  item</Text>
  <Text category="health">After reading other reviews on air
  mattresses I was worried that this mattress would not last long
  before a leak developed. But it's been over 2 months and so far
  so good. I sleep on it every night, (I'm buying a real bed when I
  move in June) and it is holding up</Text>
  <Text category="health">Looking for something small and portable?
  This is Perfec</Text>
  <Text category="health">my kids love this it fades right into the
  next color they fall right to sleep watching it change its an
  awesome light i was very pleased and its not to bright like some
  light up the room its just perfect mom of a 3 and 5 yr old
  !!</Text>
  <Text category="health">this is exactly what i wanted--the last 1
  i bought is over 10 yrs old and still going--i was afraid each
  day it would go out and could not find a replacement
  anywhere---you are a life--i mean, hair saver!! diane in
  texa</Text>
  <Text category="health">I have 3 of the priva ultra waterproof
  sheet protectors and love the product! It saves washing the whole
  bed. Just put a draw sheet over the protector and it saves so
  much laundry. Washes and dries extremely well</Text>
  <Text category="health">I bought two of these for my
  son....hoping to wean him out of pull-ups at night, without
  having to strip the whole bed when there is an accident. This pad
  is definitely leakproof. The only con is that even though it says
  it has an anti-slip backing....that is not the case. I have tried
  it with jersey sheets, and flannel sheets...but it does move alot
  and get bunched up. So, I do end up having to strip the bed every
  now and then because the pad moved during the night. If I had it
  to do over again, I would definitely buy the pad with the
  tuck-under flaps.</Text>
  <Text category="health">Alka-Seltzer got it right and in a big
  way. Drink this and 20 minutes later your headache is gone and
  your stomach is settled so you can motor down to the local taco
  stand for some much needed nourishment. I prefer the regular
  flavor as opposed to the citrus.</Text>
  <Text category="health">B&amp;amp;B Styling Creme is absolutely
  the greatest hair product I have ever used. Thanks for making it
  available on line</Text>
  <Text category="health">I bought the first mattress topper for
  myself and my husband. After the first night I knew I wanted one
  to put in our RV too. My husband complained about the smell when
  I unpacked the topper but that dissipates quickly and he too
  slept well and woke up without back pain for the first time in
  years. He had me order one for his sister for Christmas. I
  thought my sister would enjoy this comfortable mattress topper so
  now I have purchased four! This is a wonderful product. I would
  recommend it to anyone</Text>
  <Text category="health">I am diabetic and I have been losing
  about 10 lbs per month for 6 months eating these bars as a
  between meal source of protein. They satisfy my taste for
  something sweet and are filling.</Text>
  <Text category="health">I've used the Pigeon brand (I believe
  it's from Japan) milk storage bags- those are the best-quality
  bags I've ever used. Unfortunately, they're also very difficult
  to find. These Lansinoh bags are a good substitute at 1/3 of
  Pigeon's price. Not bad at all! My baby and I travel a lot so I
  bring along my stock of bmilk in these Lansinoh bags. No mishaps
  thus far. Highly recommended</Text>
  <Text category="health">I love these bags. They are easy to get
  out of the container, easy to open and close, and once the milk
  is in, they stand on their own. To be honest, I haven't tried
  other brands, so these may not be the only great ones</Text>
  <Text category="health">I've used this product with two of my
  children with out problems. I have never had a leak unlike with
  some of the other brands. Suggestions: Write the date on the bag
  before you start to pump or a nurse once suggested that you use
  labels. Also, never fill the bag! It's only meant to hold 6 oz.
  These bags are much thicker than the Gerber bags and they are the
  only ones to have the double zipper. I used these liners with my
  Avent Disposable system and standard bottles. I've gone through
  over 600 of these bags and I must say Amazon has the best price
  around</Text>
  <Text category="health">These bags are much sturdier and thicker
  than the Gerber bags. You also don't have to cut the bags open
  after defrosting/heating them up. Amazingly they are cheaper than
  the Gerber bags too! I've used them for several months and
  haven't had one leak yet. But I am pretty careful and store the
  milk bags flat in tupperware containers in the freezer</Text>
  <Text category="health">THIS IS A GREAT PRODUCT. I USE IT ON MY
  EYEGLASSES AS WELL AS MY COMPUTER SCREEN,TV SCREEN. RECOMMEND IT
  TO AL</Text>
  <Text category="health">I have used every diaper in the market
  and narrowed it down to pampers and huggies, I have a big 21
  month old baby and been looking for the perfect night time diaper
  with no leaks!! My son still fits in the size % diapers but this
  is the one we specifically use at night and been really happy
  about it, no leaks, no gel coming out of the diaper and defintely
  a happy baby when he wakes up in the morning!</Text>
  <Text category="health">I used the Huggies Overnite diapers on my
  son at night until we started potty training. I used to put
  absorbent inserts inside his pull-ups to get him through the
  night without leaks, but even that didn't work very well.
  Finally, Huggies came out with an overnight pull-up - and it
  really works well!!! Excellent product</Text>
  <Text category="health">I have had this straightener for a while,
  and I still have no complaints about it. It is an affordable
  option for those looking for a pretty good straightener. I love
  the heat settings... I only need to put mine on the second
  setting (338 degrees) for it to do a good job, and I have very
  thick wavy/curly hair. I like the 1" because it allows me to flip
  out the ends of my hair, but I'm sure the 2" one is great
  too</Text>
  <Text category="health">I get this stuff for my husband. He's got
  really thick hair and it has the tendency to get oily but this
  stuff makes his hair perfectly soft and shiny. It's worth the
  money</Text>
  <Text category="health">I used the Remington twice up to now, and
  the bottom line it is a great machine, you will never need to
  lube it, and that is a big deal with clippers. its easy to clean,
  sharp and easy to work with</Text>
  <Text category="health">Wonderful for getting all of your trigger
  points in your back especially, but also in your neck and feet.
  Your body feels so relaxed after using the TheraCane.</Text>
  <Text category="health">I have had a number of surgeries and
  injuries over the years. I see a chiropracter and a physical
  therapist every few weeks. Both of them work wonders, but then my
  body tightens up. I can't afford to see them every day! I bought
  the theracane because I saw someone else with one at a long
  distance cycling event. Now I've purchased another 3 to share
  with friends. It works! This tool has helped me stay loose, and
  has taken away a lot of the shoulder stiffness that I have
  suffered for the past 7 years. I suggest the addition of the
  trigger point therapy workbook, which will give you a lot of the
  details about the body and why/where it hurts. But even if you
  don't want to study, you can still get lots of benefits from
  daily use of the theracane</Text>
  <Text category="health">The knots in my back - my "spots" never
  really go away due to posture and my work in front of the
  computer. One day I asked a coworker what the odd green thing by
  his desk was. He explained the concept, I tried it for about two
  seconds and immediately knew this was something special. The
  leverage is perfect for zeroing in on your back knots and
  applying STRONG pressure to them - like having a strong friend
  digging their knuckle in and holding it there. I bought one the
  next day. You don't need an expensive vibrating massage wand that
  has all sorts of silly features - just this simple stick that can
  pinpoint and dissolve all your stress spots.</Text>
  <Text category="health">Its a nice little trimmer and not
  cumbersome at all like the remington trimmers. It has a cheap
  little organizer but as long as your not rough with it, it
  shouldnt break. Another benefit is that you can rinse all the
  attachments under hot water in addition to brushing the hair out
  prior to that to ensure a very clean trimmer. Just remember folks
  this is a trimmer not a wet blade or electric razor..it will
  leave a very fine layer of stubble which is fine by me. A man can
  still look neat if he shapes up the facial hair before reducing
  it to fine stubble. My shaving experience with this thing is
  pleasant...it does not pull hairs which is very refreshing for a
  trimmer. The only other device I never had/have that problem with
  is my braun 360 complete (parts of the year I shave, other parts
  of the year I trim). Its a very nice package and efficient. The
  only drawback is that it seems fragile...so be careful not to
  drop any part of this set</Text>
  <Text category="health">This is the razor to use! Excellent
  product, does what is says</Text>
  <Text category="health">Lathers well, with a pleasant (subtle)
  scent. Shipping costs spoil some of the fun. You might consider
  BarclayCrocker, given its shipping and product costs</Text>
  <Text category="health">This is a fine, well lasting bar of soup
  that smells like sweet oranges--you will catch wiffs of the very
  pleasant fragrance every time you enter the bathroom. It reminds
  me of tangerine lifesavers, if that helps. It's a big bar, too,
  the dimensions of the bar are, in inches: 4 x 2.5 and 1.5
  thick</Text>
  <Text category="health">I've had one of these little trimmers for
  four or five years now. It does its jobs, and I've have no
  reliability problems at all. One word of advice -- don't use it
  on "the boys" without the little plastic guard or you'll be
  sorry..</Text>
  <Text category="health">When my baby was a newborn we left our
  closet light on all night at first so we could check on him. It
  was also a jarring necessity to turn on the overhead light for
  diaper changes and feedings. Then I bought one of these lights
  and was impressed at the perfect amount of light it gives out.
  Just enough to see your baby by, but not enough to keep everyone
  awake. It's been almost a year now, and I'm just about to
  purchase two more. We use the light now in our toddler's room and
  turning it on is now part of our bedtime routine. We use it every
  night</Text>
  <Text category="health">What I wanted for Christmas was something
  to turn my bath tub into a whirlpool, and my boyfriend bought
  this for me. The bubbles are no doubt amazing, they're plenty
  strong even at the lowest setting. As for the massage part, I
  didn't use that too much- it just vibrates some, and the bubbles
  seemed to be more massaging than the vibrating massager. The only
  thing I did not really care for is that it was kind of difficult
  to keep on the tub floor. It has suction cups, but they didn't
  work too well- everytime I moved my feet or legs, it wanted to
  float to the top of the water. Overall, I'd say this is a pretty
  good gift! I will definitely use it many more times</Text>
  <Text category="health">These paper towels are as good as any
  cheaper paper towels; they are not cloth-like or super thick, but
  they are as good as any other paper towels you might find for the
  same price that aren't made of recycled materials. In short, they
  are cheap and better for the environment than non-recycled,
  chlorine-bleached products</Text>
  <Text category="health">After 6 months of unexplained intense
  fatigue and malaise, numerous doctor visits without results, I
  obtained Source of Life vitamins upon the recommendation of a
  friend whose physician had recommended it for them. With the very
  first dose, I went from dragging around to walking around--while
  most vitamins require weeks of use before results are seen. At my
  very next doctor's appointment, I told of my experience with
  Source of Life and I continue to report it to anyone and everyone
  that mentions being excessively tired. Members of my family and
  several friends now regularly use this outstanding product, and
  have reported similar results. Not only did I feel much better
  with higher energy levels, I also notice fingernail and hair
  growth as well. I use the liquid version and it is actually very
  tasty. I highly recommend this product. I've used it for 3 years
  and have obtained consistent good results.</Text>
  <Text category="health">If you wonder why you're feeling
  lethargic or if you have one of those little abdominal paunches
  you thought was just advancing age, then you might need probiotic
  therapy. You might even need it if your resistance to colds is
  low! Because we live much "cleaner" lives than our ancestors did,
  sterilizing our dishes, putting our food in the fridge, and
  spraying pesticides on everything, we live our lives virtually
  bacteria-free. Free of the GOOD bacteria, that is. The baddies
  seem to still get us, and without the good ones to balance them
  out, we're in trouble. A lack of friendly bacteria in your
  intestines can cause problems throughout your body. To put it in
  "nice" terms, it's a little like having backed up plumbing inside
  you, and the world just ain't gonna be right until you fix it. I
  started on probiotic therapy several months ago, and I was amazed
  at the following things that happened almost immediately: *That
  little stomach paunch WENT AWAY. I kid you not. Talk about an
  instant self-esteem booster. *My chronic [men, cover your ears]
  yeast infections decreased dramatically (even without my
  eliminating wheat from my diet, which I know I ought to do). *I
  had more energy and felt more like the me of years ago. *I became
  more resistant to colds than I used to be. If you're considering
  supplementing your diet with probiotics, you should know that not
  all of them are created equal. In fact, testing done by
  www.consumerlab.com indicates that the vast majority of probiotic
  supplements don't deliver the number of live organisms they claim
  -- not even close! Those little creatures are very delicate, and
  things like processing, shipping, and sitting on your shelf can
  kill them. And let's not even talk about what your stomach acid
  does to them. Primal Defense is one of the few supplements that
  delivers the amount of probiotics it claims to. (I can tell from
  its effects on me.) In addition, it contains lots of good-for-you
  green foods that also help build that all-important inner
  strength. One very important caveat about Primal Defense, though:
  Because it's SO effective, don't even think about starting out
  taking 3 tablets a day! Not unless you don't mind a lot of
  abdominal discomfort and are able to spend several days all by
  yourself at home. I took one a day for about 2 months, and then I
  finally felt ready to move up to 2. It'll be at least another
  month before I'm up to the recommended 3. One more thing: Drink
  lots of water. You need it anyway, and Primal Defense works best
  when you're well hydrated</Text>
  <Text category="health">Works as advertised and I am happy with
  it's function. Much nicer than other battery powered
  toothbrushes. One issue is that supposed "quick change" tool to
  remove the brush head either I can't figure out or it is
  defective, but once you put it on the brush head a pin is
  supposed to press into a slot to release the brush head. It never
  releases. Is there a trick to do this? Also the instructions say
  put on the tool press in and then pull off the brush head. The
  problem with this is once the tool is on and you press in, there
  is no way to pull off the brush head as the tool is still
  attached. Once you take the tool off the brush head will not
  slide out. Anyone figured this out yet</Text>
  <Text category="health">I have used this twice a day and love it.
  Best buy at this price</Text>
  <Text category="health">I got mine for free on sale at least 6
  months ago and it's great. I know I should probably replace the
  head by now, but it still seems to work fine, so I don't. I've
  only changed the battery once. If you want a cheap brush that
  gets the job done easier than the old fashioned type, this is it.
  Then again, if you're not lazy or weak, you can probably do just
  as good a job with a regular toothbrush and not waste
  batteries</Text>
  <Text category="health">I bought this toothbrush a month ago, and
  have been very satistfied with it. The battery lasts about a
  month and the brush leaves me with a clean feeling that you can't
  get from a manual toothbrush. The price is good, the battery life
  is good, and the battery door is very easy to open! I would buy
  it again!</Text>
  <Text category="health">Flax is a plant. The seeds in the flax
  plant are filled with flaxseed oil, (sometimes called linseed
  oil). The seeds contain fatty oils called alpha-linolenic acid
  (ALA) and linoleic acid. ALA is the omega-3 oil in flaxseed.
  Flaxseed contains both omega-3 fatty acids and omega-6 fatty
  acids. Flaxseed is nature's richest storehouse of omega-3 fatty
  acids, and contains more than twice as much omega-3 oil as fish
  oils, and it costs less , ounce for ounce. Flax also contains
  other important substances like lignans, which may protect
  against some types of cancer. The husks of the seeds are rich in
  mucilage. Both the seed oil and mucilage have many nutritional
  and therapeutic properties. There are many potential benefits
  from taking Flax seed oil: Flaxseed Oil lowers cholesterol
  levels, thereby improving cardiovascular health and lessening the
  risk of arteriosclerosis. Flaxseed also contains plant nutrients
  like phytoestrogens. These are natural estrogen-like substances
  that can lessen the discomfort of menopause. Flaxseed oil may
  lower high blood pressure. Flaxseed oil helps some people improve
  their psoriasis and eczema, as it has anti-inflammatory
  properties. Flaxseed may also reduce the itching, swelling, and
  redness associated with certain skin disorders such as acne.
  Flaxseed oil has a positive effect on rheumatoid arthritis due to
  its ability to calm inflammation. Flaxseed reduces LDL
  (low-density lipoprotein) cholesterol (the body's "bad
  cholesterol") and lowers triglyceride levels. Research shows that
  flaxseed oil gives much better protection against heart attacks
  than canola oil or olive oil. Taking flaxseed may reduce cancer
  risk. This is because flaxseed contains the richest sources of
  lignan building blocks, which play a major role in preventing
  cardiovascular diseases and cancer. New research indicates that
  the lignans in flaxseed have both short-term and long-term
  protective effects against colon cancer. Nature Made Flaxseed Oil
  is a quality source of flaxseed oil, as the company is well-known
  and reputable. One tip: keep your flaxseed oil away from light
  and heat, as both degrade the oil. The usual beneficial dose of
  Flaxseed Oil is 2-3 capsules once per day taken with a meal. Jim

  <Text category="health">i love these little bibs. i say little,
  because even though they are the size of regular cloth bibs, the
  big size Bibsters, which i also bought, are HUGE, and cover my
  9mo. old baby to almost past his diapers. i was reluctant to buy
  Bibsters at first, because they seemed such a waste of material
  being disposable- and i guess they are-- however, they serve a
  good purpose in that they are extremely light and thin and fully
  waterproof, so that my super-drooler doesn't get his outfits
  totally wet like he does with his cloth bibs, which i'm
  frequently switching out. Bibsters are also very easy to pack
  into the diaper bag, and i'm never without a bib. i've also been
  using the big size bibsters on my 2yr old in the car, for random
  snack spills. these are not really reusable, but i sometimes do
  use them for 2 meals, depending on how clean they are. The price
  was right when Amazon grocery had the spend 50 get 10 dea</Text>
  <Text category="health">My wife loves this! It was not too
  expensive, and she really has been very appreciative, esp for her
  eye makeup</Text>
  <Text category="health">Love it! Love it! Love it! It's like a

  <Text category="health">This is one of those products I'd put on
  my "must have" list if I had an elderly parent who couldn't
  handle a vaccumm and had some area rugs or runners near the front
  door or entrance to any room. For daily touch-ups, these things
  can't be beat. They are extremely light and get all the stuff
  that gets dragged into the house between deep vacuuming. Of
  course, I really believe that a doormat at the front door will go
  a LONG way in keeping out a lot of the dust and debris. For the
  stuff that gets by that, use the Carpet Flick. I tend to shake
  out my runners and deep vaccum them regularly but I've noticed
  that some people who are elderly don't have the strength for
  that. Because I help out taking care of two people over 90, this
  has been a great help to them in maintaining their independence
  and ability to keep things clean when I'm not around...and I'm
  all for helping people to help themselves stay functional!</Text>
  <Text category="health">Easy on the back and shoulders, as this
  is very light. It does a good enough surface job until the
  weekend vaccuuming. My 2 year old daughter loves to use it to
  help mommy! I bought this in a drug and discount store for
  $13.95. It's worth that</Text>
  <Text category="health">The razor and trimmer are both easy to

  <Text category="health">I gave this to a bearded man for
  Christmas. To my knowledge, he has used it only once, with no
  complaints. Was nice for the main reason, he had no electrical
  outlet in bathroom and had to drag large drop cord from another
  room to use old one. This one is so convenient and I am sure he
  enjoys it. Purchasing was a breeze. Thank yo</Text>
  <Text category="health">I purchased this dryer to replace an
  older one that is far too loud. While this new one is much
  quieter than the old one, it really isn't super-quiet. Still, I
  have no complaints on the noise, but the flimsy wall mounting
  hardware is another story. The threaded holes in the mounting
  plate are extremely fragile, so much so that they both were wrung
  out during the initial mounting of the dryer. It didn't help any
  that the mounting holes were extremely hard to locate once the
  plate was mounted - it's hard to see thru that white plastic
  shell. I ended up having to discard the original threaded screws
  and use two slightly larger metal tapping screws to mount the
  dryer to the bracket. This worked fine, but the original mounting
  hardware isn't very well designed in my opinion. Other than that
  the dryer seems to work very well, although I haven't had it long
  enough to know how well it will last. All in all, I'd give the
  dryer 4 stars out of 5</Text>
  <Text category="health">I've owned two Thermaphore heating pads,
  different sizes, for many years and I'm using one right now!
  They're quality made to last a lifetime. They trap moisture from
  the air so no need for soaking sponges to insert. The trigger
  switch allows you to heat as needed as hot as you like and if you
  fall asleep there are no worries of burns..if the trigger isn't
  depressed it isn't heating. I wouldn't be without mine. It helps
  me manage my arthritis/fibromylagia/nerve damage pain. I've
  recommended it to many of my friends who have been very pleased
  as well.</Text>
  <Text category="health">This is a wonderful product. It smells

  <Text category="health">I am one of the people who just doesn't
  like applying liquid foundation and cannot do it well, but needs
  more than just the light coverage of powder foundation. The New
  Complexion cream foundations do exactly that. I have used
  numerous cream (or liquid-powder) foundations and this is by far
  the best and at a good price as well! The neat little compact
  includes a mirror and separate storage space for your sponge,
  which I love because I hate when my sponges become covered in
  product, all in the same space as a regular compact. I've
  personally never been one to use compact mirrors, myself,
  however. But it's not the package or the sponge which I love,
  it's the product. It's neither too liquid nor is it too stiff,
  like some products. It's perfectly creamy and works well with the
  sponge it comes with. You really needn't use a lot to have even
  overall covered but by using more you can obtain a thicker
  coverage. I find that this makeup blends well with my skin and
  does a good job of evening out my skin tone, as well, without
  appearing too much like a mask. You can feel it a little but it
  somehow just feels right on my skin. Also, I do recommend using a
  powder over it to reduce shine. Overall, I love this
  makeup</Text>
  <Text category="health">I do a lot of walking, as well as

  DEFINITELY recommend this product</Text>
  <Text category="health">Got my Chillow a few months ago and wish
  I had not waited so long! It is great! My own personal
  "thermostat" having gone haywire years ago, I have wished for
  something to help me sleep and be cool. This is it! First, it
  allows my husband to cuddle up next to me without my pushing him
  away cause he's so darn warm and I just can't take the extra
  heat. Second, I have wished for a firm pillow forever!! and have
  tried many different pillows and a great side benefit of the
  Chillow is that it makes my pillow really firm. It can be a bit
  too cold for a minute or two, but it evens out before long. For
  those of you who have that problem, you might consider doing what
  I did. I purchased a "Bedsack" quilted &amp;amp; zippered pillow
  cover. Put the pillow + the Chillow in that and then in a
  pillowcase and it's just perfect. Might also help the vinyl scent
  that some of you complain about. I will agree that the Chillow
  makes my pillow very heavy, but that is my only complaint. And
  I'm not carrying it around so the weight is really not an issue.
  Other than that, I wish I had purchased one of these Chillows
  long ago. It is a menopausal woman's dream come true!</Text>
  <Text category="health">out of all the hair striaghters I have
  owned and I have gone through about 6 this is the best one yet! I
  really like it! it straightens my hair perfectly, and you cant
  beat the price</Text>
  <Text category="health">Well this is marketed as a quick and
  healthy snack for kids, but I find it perfect for me. It's a
  great charge of chocolate and not too many calories and bit of
  fiber, what more can you ask for</Text>
  <Text category="health">The filter is small compared with most
  other systems; has a sturdy, metal fixture and pull-knob
  activator; filters quickly with plenty pressure; and of course it
  has the great Culligan taste</Text>
  <Text category="health">Excellent product. Really protects you.
  My dermatologist recommended this product and although it's more
  expensive - it's worth the protection for your skin. I'm glad my
  children are using it</Text>
  <Text category="health">Finally, a product that does as it
  promises. Excellent sun burn protection -- even in Hawaii</Text>
  <Text category="health">I am very satisfied with Nizoral
  Anti-Dandruff Shampoo. Many anti-dandruff shampoos tend to make
  my hair feel dry or rough. I have thick, waist-length hair and
  Nizoral got rid of the dandruff and left it feeling soft and easy
  to manage. Unlike some anti-dandruff shampoos that have a
  medicinal smell, Nizoral has a pleasant fragrance. I'll
  definitely use this product any time I need a dandruff
  shampoo</Text>
  <Text category="health">Nizoral Anti-Dandruff Shampoo seems to be
  a very good product. I noticed a difference the first time I used
  it -- there was no residue on my scalp, and my flakiness was
  greatly reduced. It produced a very rich lather, also. The only
  thing I didn't like about it was the possibility that I'd have an
  allergic reaction to the ingredients, but the instructions didn't
  tell which ingredients might make this happen. I, myself, am
  sensitive to many products, and didn't have any reaction to the
  ingredients of the shampoo. I would recommend this product to
  others</Text>
  <Text category="health">Love it, love it, love it! It got my hair
  soooooo straight and in record time. I highly recommend this
  product. Esp. for African American hairtypes. :-</Text>
  <Text category="health">excellent product my hair was striaght
  and dry in a matter of minutes</Text>
  <Text category="health">The foot massager is great. It's open
  design allows it to be used on the legs as well as the feet
  unlike others that are boot like. The massager adjusts to your
  size legs and feet automatically for a snug fit. The massager is
  adjustable to almost any configuartion with tilt, raise/lower and
  etc. The only problem with this device is that it can become top
  heavy as a result of the adjustability of it. So keeping it
  upright can be a bit challenging. But for the price and quality
  this is a great relief on the feet and legs as well as
  wallet</Text>
  <Text category="health">This product is simply phenomenal. I've
  seen better results using this than with department store
  brands</Text>
  <Text category="health">I picked this up at the store a couple of
  months ago, and it works well. I does have a nice light scent
  initially, and it sooths the face. It does not have any SPF
  though, so in summer I used a different balm. But it has been
  good this winter. Check it out</Text>
  <Text category="health">It usually takes forever for me to dry my
  hair, but it dried really fast and STRAIGHT! I can go a few extra
  weeks without a relaxer! And the color is beautiful... I just
  love orange :O</Text>
  <Text category="health">Saw this product, or maybe it was a
  similar one in a shop in Cairns, Australia. It was selling for
  about $70 Australia Dollars.....which is still quite expensive
  converted to US$. I came back to U.S. and found it on Amazon for
  $15.99, with free ship if I purchased $30. So, I bought
  two......one for myself, one for my husband! It is wonderful! We
  wear contacts for distance, so it is such a convenience to always
  have it around our necks, less the neckchains, which always used
  to get tangled. It's an ingenius invention</Text>
  <Text category="health">We have a GoldenDoodle with a lot of hair
  and this clipper works wonderfully. It breezes right through the
  thickest hair! I highly recommend</Text>
  <Text category="health">The clippers are excellent quality and
  cut well. We have a poodle that has very thick hair. If you take
  your time, these clippers do a wonderful job</Text>
  <Text category="health">I bought this model 7 years ago for over
  $100 and it is still running strong although I only use it to
  clip a small family dog. Nevertheless, forget the cheap vibrating
  'magnetic motor' clippers - not enough power and the buzzing
  bothers the animal. This clipper uses a superior rotating motor
  that is more powerful and provides a consistent cutting action.
  In fact, with the right (replaceable) blade, you could use this
  to cut kids hair as well. It stays cool, unlike the magnetic
  motor design. Use with Oster Kool Lube and you will never have
  problems getting a clean cut. It uses blades by Oster so there is
  a lot of versatility possible</Text>
  <Text category="health">Man these things are the best. They can

  <Text category="health">Nicely designed., effecitve, close shave,
  very reasonable cost, BUT..could they tell you simply how to turn
  it ON? Embarassed to admit, took me almost 15 minutes to figure
  out the ON/OFF feature</Text>
  <Text category="health">I was looking for a lightweight simple
  wet/dry shaving device that had inexpensive replacement foil and
  blade assemblies. The Panasonic WES9941P fit perfectly. Gives a
  nice shave, and it's so easy to clean. It replaces my old Braun
  single head linear. (I like the Panasonic better.) The batteries
  supply over two weeks of shaves on a single charge. Give it a few
  weeks of shaves to break in to cut real close</Text>
  <Text category="health">Had one for the last 2 years until I tore
  the screen. This is the best shaver I have ever used. Shaves fast
  and clean.Its cheap enough that I will buy another one rather
  than replace the screen. Don't like the charger as it is too easy
  to knock the shaver off of it</Text>
  <Text category="health">This is one of the nicest electric
  shavers that I've owned and the first wet-type shaver. I have
  previously owned Norelcos for over a decade. The original
  Norelcos (made in Holland) were fine but the recent ones have
  pathetic quality and they literally pull hair! It is painful! I
  eventually gave up trying to use my replacement lift-and-cut
  Norelco and decided to try out a high end model that cost close
  to two hundred dollars. Bad idea - you don't always get what you
  pay for! I was not quite happy with that either and after a two
  year haitus with disposable Gillettes, decided to try a wet
  shaver. I took my chance on this one, based solely on the reviews
  here. This is the very first "wet" shaver I've used and
  absolutely love it. It gives a close enough shave but not too
  close. You can use it with whatever shaving cream you use. Note
  that the Panasonic manual encourages using the cheapest foam type
  (not gel), Barbasol like stuff with this shaver. It also comes
  with a basic carrying pouch and the cleaning is as easy as it can
  get (just wash the thing under tap water). They really meant that
  this unit is washable. It is recharagable, lasts seven days on a
  charge, and costs less than replacement blades for competing
  brands. The build quality is excellent. The charger is a very
  clever design that gets the shaver completely off your counter
  space. You cannot go wrong with this. Amazon has a great value
  here. Sometimes you get more than you asked for and this is one
  of those rare things. Highly recommended.</Text>
  <Text category="health">Shaves great wet or dry. I like it
  because it pivots real good. No cuts, it was worth every
  penny</Text>
  <Text category="health">My husband and I have one drink of
  Nature's Plus every morning and sometimes at lunch or for dinner.
  We started out with Vanilla. I add a handful of instant oatmeal-
  2 baby carrots- a spoonful of peanut butter- 5 ice cubes- 1 cup
  1% milk and you're hooked! The ice cubes make it like a real
  shake. I have a Vita Mix and that realy makes it blend well. I
  blend for 30 seconds. My husband uses the Vanilla with 1 cup of
  1% milk - 4 TBS of Ovaltine - a handful of oatmeal- a spoonful of
  peanut butter- 5 ice cubes- blend for 30 seconds and I don't have
  to cook! I like the Strawberry. I take a cup of milk (1%)- 6
  frozen strawberries- a handful of instant oatmeal- 2 baby carrots
  - and 4 ice cubes. Havenly and very satisfying and losing weight
  to boot!</Text>
  <Text category="health">I have tried many brands of soy shakes,

  <Text category="health">The product is very good, do not
  misunderstand me although it is not as good as the same produt
  when we bought it ten years ago: The curls tend to stay put less
  time compared with the former hair curler tubes. But still, we
  strongly recommend them against heat activated tubes. It's a good
  buy</Text>
  <Text category="health">I bought this bag for my husband as a
  surprise (as I had bought another brand, and he did not like the
  Asian floral print). It's very roomy, looks great, fits
  ergonomically. I really love the pocket design and the space that
  they have, as well as the interior design. Fits things better
  than my own bag! My husband loves it and can't wait to use it!
  Plus that, this is the best price I've seen online, and of
  course, Amazon ships quickly and accurately</Text>
  <Text category="health">This product is a blessing for
  handicapped users. It is solidly built, easy to roll about with

  <Text category="health">There are a lot of positive comments
  about this mirror and some very negative comments. I weighed both
  before I made my decision and chose to give more weight to the
  positive comments. I am glad I did. The light from the mirror is
  bright, the slide bar for the different light settings works very
  well. If you hold the switch to the count of 2 or 3 and then
  release the lights work every time. I enjoy the mirror very much
  and would buy another or recommend that someone buy it for their
  use. The only negative I have about the mirror is that the
  flourescent tubes buzz a little but I am getting accustomed and
  learning to tune them out.</Text>
  <Text category="health">I bought this product specifically
  because it was originally described as being/having
  "mood-brightening Natural Spectrum light." I thought it would
  help on the gloomy Pacific Northwest winter days. I got it on a
  Friday sale price, so it seemed like a good value for the product
  description given here. The lamp just arrived (a few days ago -
  when I originally submitted this review), and the product's FAQ
  sheet states this product is "designed only to provide excellent
  quality light for daily tasks and hobbies. This lamp does *not*
  offer the correct level of light intensity specified by the
  National Institute of Mental Health for the treatment of Seasonal
  Affective Disorder (S.A.D.). The product literature packed with
  the lamp has no mention at all that this product offers
  "mood-brightening" light. Because of this glaring
  misrepresentation, I am currently debating whether to the return
  the lamp. I agree with the other reviewer that the adhesive
  labels (there are two) are VERY sticky and difficult to remove
  completely. I used a combination of methods to remove the
  adhesive residue. And I agree with the comments about the company
  name being printed on the front of the lamp. When I saw it in the
  picture, I thought it had to be some kind of company watermark or
  logo for the stock photo ONLY, so I was shocked to see "Verilux"
  actually printed/embossed into the lamp housing, in a very
  prominent location on the front of the lamp. Very cheesy, for a
  lamp of this price point and quality. If you're looking for a
  "clean" bright light, in a stylish, portable lamp, this is not a
  bad choice. But if you're looking for a full-spectrum light that
  does offer some light "therapy," this is probably the wrong
  choice. The company does have other, "therapeutic" lighting
  options, but at a higher price point. Nov 1, 2006 UPDATE - I was
  concerned enough about the original, misleading product
  description that I submitted my concerns to Amazon. I now see
  that the description had been revised since submitting those
  concerns. I want to thank Amazon for their very prompt response
  in correcting the product description, which should help other
  buyers make a more-informed decision.</Text>
  <Text category="health">This is a useful tool in that it makes
  the software/hardware combination available at a less expensive

  there is not a lot of information on interpretation of the

  sense of what one is doing. However for the price it is
  definitely worth it and I could see that some people may want to
  get the game mostly for the option of having this expansion

  <Text category="health">I love all the varieties of chocolate,

  hand-held mixer does not do these nutrition shakes justice. These
  are a great meal replacement - healthy, nutritious, and full of

  <Text category="health">I haven't used it thoroughly yet. But
  from what I have seen so far, it is a pretty good scale to track
  your everyday fat loss progress. I am satisfied with this
  purchase for the price and quality and ease of use. I use it
  daily to track my body fat % and weight. So far used it for only
  myself. Haven't checked it out for more than 1 users</Text>
  <Text category="health">this thing is really cool and works very
  easily. Once you perform the 10 minute setup and enter your info

  of $700. I am in it as I write this!!! Very nice and relaxing.
  Sometimes the "percussion" setting is a little too hard in some
  spots but otherwise it's great. I would agree that I wish it went
  a little further up the neck. I just sit a little lower in the
  chair for it. Not sure if it's worth $700 just because that's
  alot of money but I've got no problem with $500. I think my wife

  <Text category="health">This handy little device has be a

  these. The timer counts down the hours and then chirps. When you
  silence the alarm, it automatically starts the countdown again.
  The storage compartment is handy for keeping my pills when I
  travel. Most of the time, I just use it to remind me to take my
  pills. I wish I knew about this a long time ago</Text>
  <Text category="health">I'm a vain, 39 year old male and started
  using this product (in combination with another highly regarded
  anti-wrinkle product) about three months ago. This daily
  application replaced a daily application of facial
  conditioner/moisturizer. I was hoping some barely noticable
  forehead wrinkles would go away. No such luck. I notice a
  definite reduction in wrinkle depth in the morning, before I
  shower, but by mid-day, the wrinkles have returned to their
  normal state. Does this really work?! I suppose the only way to
  truly find out if this stuff works is to use it on only half the
  face and see the effect over time. In all fairness, I must
  mention that my face now routinely feels softer and smoother and
  less oily than before. That's why I rated this product a four
  instead of a three. But the frickin' wrinkles are still there!
  Let me see all that clinical research all these skin care experts
  are touting.</Text>
  <Text category="health">This product does wonders. It helped with
  blotchy skin and made my whole face feel softer yet firmer within
  a week. Like another customer, I have sensitive skin. I didn't
  feel this dried my skin out at all. But a word to the wise, make
  sure to read the directions carefully, this product is not meant
  for use around the eyes which might explain some complaints. If
  used properly, its fantastic</Text>
  <Text category="health">First of all I am in my early 20's so I
  haven't much experience in night creams. I just more recently
  took an interest in moisturizers and eye creams after I decided
  to quit tanning and rather preserve my youthfulness. I use
  "moisture therapy cream" by Olay in the morning before I put on
  my makeup, and then I use this at night. My skin always feels so
  soft, more soft than I think it ever did. I can't give any
  testaments on its firming or anti-wrinkle ability, but I can say
  it does make my skin glow and my complexion look healthier. The
  scent is great and it is a great smell to fall asleep to. I would
  recommend this product to anyone of any age. It has a good price
  compared to everything else on the market and I believe it is
  best to start moisturizing when you are young rather than waiting
  until the signs of aging have already begun. Prevention is
  key</Text>
  <Text category="health">Well, let's FACE it..short of any
  procedure that is invasive(botox,cosmetic surgery, etc), there
  really isnt any magic cream that is going to reverse the aging
  process, but there are a number of products that will aid in
  improving the look, feel and texture of your face. I've been
  trying out several of the products out there, and I found "Olay
  Total Effects Night Firming Cream For Face and Neck" to be one of
  the best ones around. I really like this one alot because of the
  many benefits it has all in one jar. After using it pretty
  generously for a little over a month(I've used about 1/2 the jar
  so far), I found it worked wonders on improving the look and feel
  of my skin. It minimized the appearance of fine lines, really
  hydrated my dry skin, improving on firmness, absorbed deep into
  my skin, so using it every night, I could still feel the softness
  the next morning, and left my face feeling very smooth to the
  touch. I especially felt and saw visable result around my neck
  and throat area(where I am really starting to get that over 50
  look). It has a nice, very light scent, and here's the best
  part... The price here at Amazon is about 1/2 of what I paid when
  I purchased it along with my groceries at the market(and it was
  even on sale at the store), so at around twelve dollars here
  right now, it's a real bargain. There are 7 benefits listed on
  the box, some I mentioned above, others include evening skin
  tone, minimizes the appearance of pores and reduces the
  appearance of blotches and age spots. Give this one a try for any
  of these aging signs. Don't expect a miracle. The wrinkles will
  not vanish, but a nice improvement in the look and feel of your
  skin, a healthy glow that leaves you feeling just a little better
  about yourself(and a a great price). The formula includes a fast
  absorbing skin strengthener called VitaNiacin(Vit B3, Vit E and
  Pro-Vit B5),wheat protein and hydrators. I like it and recommend
  it.....Laurie</Text>
  <Text category="health">I love the Medi-beads products, and
  highly recommend them. Although not as comfortable as the pliable
  elasto-gel, I love the moist heat and the weight of the pads. I
  used them therapeutically both for myself and for massage therapy
  clients. I only wish they made a longer one to cover the entire
  back, but 2 of the king-sized pads will do it. Microwave time
  will vary according to the power of your microwave.</Text>
  <Text category="health">I've been wearing glasses for almost 25
  years now. Its been difficult to find a decent way to clean
  glasses that doesn't either streak or damage the lenses --
  especially with AR and other coatings they put on glasses these
  days. The Sharper Image eyeglass cleaner does the trick. It also,
  by design, cleans your frames which is a plus. I would have given
  4.5 stars due to the size of polishing cloth they supply. Its
  sufficient for only cleaning one pair of glasses. I have two pair
  (regular and sunglasses) so no real fault there. I recommend
  getting a 3M microfiber cleaning cloth as an alternative to what
  is supplied</Text>
  <Text category="health">I love the smell of an essential oil in
  the air. I've tried tealight burners, a smear on a low-burning
  lamp, and a miniature crockpot designed for aromatherapy. The
  PearlEssence Spa Mist is absolutely the best ever for diffusing
  an odor and continuing to diffuse it for an extended period of
  time. Because I live in a humid climate, I was concerned that
  misting would only add to mold problems and perhaps mar wooden
  furniture. The cool mist instantly absorbs even into our air. The
  light show of the base can be turned off, but I like it most of
  the time. Product was offered for $10 less than at a well-known
  local natural market chain, and shipping was free with my order
  over $25 with other products.</Text>
  <Text category="health">The sound of it working is great ambient
  noise for sleeping and wth oils it makes you room smell
  wonderful! It does a reasonable job of humidification in my
  medium sized bedroom but it acts a little snarky in that it tries
  to turn itself on often when there is no water left in it. And it
  doesnt hold enough water to enjoy it all night but it will run
  for several hours. The light show and the aromatherapy can be
  quite a nice mood setter romantically as well</Text>
  <Text category="health">finally tried this, and I definitely
  recommend it. It doesnt have a strong smell, very pleasant and
  neutral. It feels so good on your skin after you shave, very
  soothing and moisturizing. Try some, you'll love it</Text>
  <Text category="health">I've had my first bottle of this after
  shave for a year and I have just finally begun to run out. While
  I don't use it everday, I use it regularly and when needed. I use
  an electric shaver which often leaves my face dry and slightly
  irritated. This Nivea after shave is wonderful. It only takes a
  small amount to cover my whole face and neck. It leaves me
  refreshed and smooth feeling. Sometimes I'll leave the house and
  forget to put it on, and I'll go all the way back just to put it
  on. It gets your day off to a great start. No funky smells or
  textures here. Give it a try, you won't be disappointed</Text>
  <Text category="health">My wife found the women's version of this

  <Text category="health">Unfortunately, millions of Americans
  currently suffer from the debilitating effects of stress,
  anxiety, and depression. In the pharmaceutical industry,
  anti-anxiety medications and antidepressants are among the
  best-selling medications on the market. The everyday stressors
  faced by Americans have simply become too much for many to bear,
  and reasonably so. In recent years, taking an anti-anxiety
  medication or antidepressant has become as common as taking a
  multivitamin. However, the side effects and long-term effects of
  such medications were for the most part unknown until recently.
  In the past year, some of the drastic negative effects of such
  medications have come to light, much to the horror of patients
  and physicians alike. Anti-anxiety medications and
  antidepressants have been linked to addiction, severe withdrawal,
  weight gain, vertigo, and even suicide and death. To treat the
  symptoms of stress, anxiety, and depression, without negative
  health implications, many are now turning to natural supplements
  -- safely and with much success. Most consumers are confused
  about which natural stress, anxiety, and depression supplements
  to take. Fortunately, there are now a few promising natural
  supplements on the market which offer truly effective results,
  safely. The challenge lies in distinguishing the effective
  products from the one's that are based more on marketing hype. It
  is critical that the product you choose contains those
  ingredients proven effective for treatment through clinical
  study, and that those ingredients are of the highest grade and
  included in the proper dosage in the product. This is the key to
  getting the results you desire - freedom from stress, anxiety,
  and depression. After researching nearly every available natural
  anxiety product on the market today I can tell you that many
  products contain low-grade ingredients in amounts far too small
  to be truly effective. There are a few, however, with clinical
  research behind them that also contain quality ingredients in
  efficacious doses. These products offer the definite potential to
  counter your emotional and physical responses to stress, anxiety,
  and depression. After review of the products and the available
  scientific literature only those products that met the criteria
  were recommended, Here is a list of the Top The Top 10 Stress,
  Anxiety and Depression Supplements On The Market Today: 1)
  Anxietol 7(tm) 2) Welatonin(tm) 3) Pinadol(tm) 4) Seredyn(tm) 5)

  <Text category="health">You won't have to use much lotion on your
  body after using this product. I love it....</Text>
  <Text category="health">If you don't like getting attention,
  these are not for you. I'm often surprised by people's astonished
  reactions to the act of putting them on and taking them off; I'm
  so accustomed to pulling them apart, that I forget how unusual
  the viewing public finds it. I have been wearing Clics for nearly
  a year. I pretend that I don't need glasses, but of course I do
  and have for nearly a decade. Popped the standard diopter lenses
  out, and put in my bifocal prescription. It worked great, despite
  a warning from my optical shop. (And even if they had broken from
  the experiment, the price is right: I could try it again.)
  Previously I was wearing glasses on a chain. Besides the various
  difficulties noted by another reviewer, I also found that the
  plastic loops that connect the chain to the arms of the glasses
  have a bad habit of stretching. Then the glasses slip off the
  chain at inappropriate times and the frames break. I call the
  color of mine "magenta" - which may or may not be the same as the
  online "red" - I bought them in a shop (**gasp**). My short hair
  is not a problem, but I agree that reading in bed doesn't work.
  So I use a different pair for those occasions</Text>
  <Text category="health">The LifeSource BP Monitor was just what I
  wanted and was priced just right. It was delivered in a timely
  manner and I am a happy camper along with my wife. Thanks.</Text>
  <Text category="health">After a few months of debating whether or
  not I needed the extra light for my work space I made the great
  choice of purchasing the HappyLite. I've been using it the past
  few weeks and have really enjoyed how it brightens up the dark
  corner better than a regular lamp. Now my only concern is how to
  order an extra bulb.... (guess I should read the materials it
  came with).</Text>
  <Text category="health">No problems. Like the small format
  bottle, easy to store. Works as well as anything else</Text>
  <Text category="health">Great smell. Worth the cost. Cleans
  great. I have used this laundry soap for quite some time now and
  happy.</Text>
  <Text category="health">I bought this for my father-in-law who
  had a stroke this past summer at sixty eight years old. My
  mother-in-law at sixty seven, doesn't have a lot of arm and
  shoulder strength and cannot wield a full-size wheelchair around
  and constantly pull it in and out of the trunk of their toyota
  camry. The light weight of this chair works great for short trips
  to appointments. I wouldn't recommend it for a long day shopping
  at the mall however. It's not as easy to use as a full-size
  standard wheelchair. This is a great chair for shorter trips and
  appointments to make transferring easier to manage</Text>
  <Text category="health">Lightweight, easy to transport, easy to
  put together. Just remember, the person in the chair cannot
  maneuver on their own. Someone must be able to push. But what a
  great product</Text>
  <Text category="health">My mother is 87 and the shower chair
  makes it easier. She likes it in the tub better and I just use
  warm water poured over her</Text>
  <Text category="health">I've used several types of cervical cold
  packs over the past few years, both at home and also professional
  cold packs at chiropractic appointments to help decrease muscle
  inflammation, and this is by far the best because of its super
  flexible fabric immediately from the freezer and its ability to
  stay cold for a longer time if needed</Text>
  <Text category="health">very handy and portable. Fits my neck
  good and I can even walk around with it on and not worry about it
  falling off or moving</Text>
  <Text category="health">I got into Aquis microfiber towels
  because my aged mother does not have the arm strength for big fat
  terry towels. I then bought some for myself because besides being
  light they absorb like crazy -- one swipe and you're dry. I
  decided to get one of the 'adventure' line because information
  was that they are like the dog-drying towels which are very like
  the lisse crepe ones. What I didn't realize was not only I buying
  a very nice towel, it comes in a very nice little nylon zippered
  bag, mesh on one side to facilitate drying. We're talking the
  sort of little bag you'd spend about $5 to buy from a travel gear
  catalog. I was thrilled to pieces. Also in keeping with the
  'adventure'-travel theme, these towels have little tags on one
  corner that can be snapped back on themselves to form a loop to
  hang the towel from. Very handy for camping, meaningless but not
  annoying for home use. I like how the loop normally is just a
  long tag so that the loop does not tangle in the washer</Text>
  <Text category="health">This product was reffered to me by my
  hairstylist after she noticed alot of frizziness and breakage in
  my hair. This has worked beautifully to protect my hair from the
  blowdryer and straightening iron! I would give this product 10
  stars if it were available! My hair is very smooth and very
  healthy looking because of this product and other products by
  Chi. I absolutely recommend this to anyone</Text>
  <Text category="health">I am 100% satisfied with this product and
  it has already earned me what I paid for. I am able to trim my
  front portion of hair with this on my own, where as for a
  complete trim, I do need my wife's assistance. If you trim on a
  regular basis, ie., when the hair's not over grown, you will
  definitely find the job more easier.I recommend it to everyone
  who wants to save on their haircuts. The price is a good deal too
  if you buy from amazon, else one may perhaps ahve to wait for the
  Thanks giving sale</Text>
  <Text category="health">We purchased eight of these (6 - 3/4 in.
  and 2 - 1 in.) for our beauty salon in 1994, and we've never used
  another brand since. With their quick heat-up time and
  multi-level heat options, these irons perform superbly for
  precision curls. I was so pleased their performance that I bought
  one to use at home to replace my fancy Vidal Sassoon gold barrel,
  which only had two heat settings - Too Hot and Burnt Scalp. The
  heating element is so efficient that Level 1 or 2 is probably
  sufficient for most home users. Rarely did I have to set the iron
  at Level 4 or 5, and never above 5. It takes less than a minute
  for the iron to heat up. Four of the six irons we originally
  purchased lasted through 3+ years of constant professional use.
  At the price we paid, our weekly cost averaged out to pennies. If
  you purchase this product you will -NOT- be disappointed</Text>
  <Text category="health">This creatine works very good on me
  building muscle,it has no flavor,i recommend it with a good
  diet!! see results in weeks!</Text>
  <Text category="health">I've used creatine as a strength aid to
  supplement my lifting for years. This is the real stuff at the
  best price I've ever seen.</Text>
  <Text category="health">Excellent product, good quality at a good
  price. I bought this Whal's trimmer to replace a Whal's trimmer
  that I have used for over 15 years. That alone speaks for
  itself</Text>
  <Text category="health">These are hands down, the most awesome
  pillows, we have ever owned. They were originally suggested by a
  chiropractor at $60 per pillow, however at the time, a "water bed
  pillow" for $60 just sounded silly. What brought me back around
  to these pillows, was the year-long search that my wife and I had
  been on for the perfect pillows. One of her beloved cats managed
  to destroy our previous and quite comfortable pillows, which
  subsequently caused us to get caught up in the frustrating search
  for the perfect pillow. We spent a year, buying this pillow and
  that pillow, all to no avail. Then one day I rolled the dice, and
  bought a pair of these pillows with the covers. The covers
  actually make the dish. These are the most comfortable pillows
  that I have ever slept on in my 42 years on this planet!!! These
  pillows rate 10 stars!!! Just follow the directions and enjoy the
  best nights sleep you have ever had. I do not work for, nor own
  this company, although after using their product I wish I did!!!
  Our pillows are about three months old so far, and holding up
  exceptionally well. They recommend you change the water every six
  months or so, depending on what type of water you put in. The
  pillow is about half to three quarters cushion, with the water
  being the bottom layer. They seal tight and do not leak. There is
  no audible sound from the water in the pillow, as if you follow
  the directions, they will instruct you on how to expel excess
  air. These pillows and of those Black &amp;amp; Decker scissors,
  have to be my two best finds for 2006!!</Text>
  <Text category="health">This is a great value - probably one of
  the best shower heads I've used. Yes - there are better ones for
  $100+, but this is absolutely amazing</Text>
  <Text category="health">This is a truly amazing deal from Amazon,
  where I also received Free Priority Mail Shipping. The photo does
  not display all that you will get. You will receive 6 boxes of
  Q-Tips Cotton Swabs, totaling an ammazing 3,500 Q-Tips in all. I
  WILL NEVER EVER HAVE TO PURCHASE ANOTHER Q-TIP AS LONG AS I
  LIVE!!!!! WHAT A FANTASTIC DEAL FROM AMAZON!</Text>
  <Text category="health">This curling iron works well. It heats
  quickly and I'm very satisfied</Text>
  <Text category="health">I just bought this iron and I couldn't be
  happier. It's the perfect size and weight. The plates aren't
  unmanageably large, or pitifully small... It heats up incredibly
  fast-- we're talking in less than 60 seconds. I have short-ish,
  wavy and coarse hair- it's straight and silky smooth within 5
  minutes. HAI is a brand used in many salons and it's all for a
  reason- they make fantastic flat irons. If you bought this same
  iron at a salon, you could easily pay upwards of $150 in
  Canada... so I consider this price an awesome deal</Text>
  <Text category="health">I bought this dryer based on other
  people's review. It is an excellent dryer. The air flow is strong
  and it dries my medium to long hair faster than my old one ever
  did. I didn't give it 5 stars because it is a bit heavier than
  most dryers...however, since it dries my hair fast, my arms don't
  mind the weight. :) 2 thumbs up in my book!!</Text>
  <Text category="health">In the past, I bought hair dryers at
  Target because of the prices. I had no idea that a few more bucks
  can buy you a quality hair dryer that surpasses any Conair,
  Sassoon, etc. purchased at this and similar stores. The
  difference in the quality is noticed immediately upon use.
  Although the BB Pro is a little heavier than I'm used to, it
  dries hair faster and with fewer frizzes. It's amazing</Text>
  <Text category="health">I purchased this dryer for my wife. It
  took me a long time to find it since all hair dryers come with
  1600 to 1850 watts power setting. My wife's hair is thick and
  long, so she didn't want get anything below 2000 watts. This one
  is light, powerfull and handy. I strongly recommend it</Text>
  <Text category="health">I did a great deal of research on the
  Internet for the "best" shower filter. I was concerned about the
  filter not lasting, losing water pressure, etc. I came across the
  Aquasana on amazon and read all the great reviews on it... After
  ordering it, I am so glad that I did. It was really easy to
  install and I honestly feel like the water pressure coming out of
  it is BETTER than with my old shower head. The shower head
  swivels and has several different settings, like massage,
  rainfall-type flow, etc. It really does feel like you are
  showering in spring water. Just the idea of showering in
  chlorine-free and mineral-free water is refreshing in itself. I
  am really happy with my purchase and would definitely recommend
  it to anyone living in an apartment who wants filtered water and
  who cannot install a filter on the main line.... It's a little
  pricy but well worth it.</Text>
  <Text category="health">I am so happy with Aquasana Shower
  Filter. I live in a building where the water is so harsh and
  sometimes discolored. As a consequence, my skin shortly turned
  dry and I continuously got skin problems. I even thought about
  buying drinking water to clean my face everyday. Now that I have
  found Aquasana, I feel so happy. It does what it promises. I
  could feel the smoother skin by just using it from the first
  time. And it did feel like showering in natural spring water. I
  couldn't be happier with this product</Text>
  <Text category="health">Compared to the Olive &amp;amp; Aloe bar,
  this one seems to lather better</Text>
  <Text category="health">This is excellent..I like the ease of
  using it and the digital read out is great. I highly recommend
  this produc</Text>
  <Text category="health">They had one of these mirrors in a 5 star
  hotel that my husband and I stayed at and I fell in love with it!
  I HAD TO HAVE ONE OF MY OWN and thanks to Amazon I was able to
  find one. This is an EXCELLENT product. My husband installed it
  easily and I would never be without one again. One side is
  magnified and my eyebrows have never looked so good, lol, and
  eyelining is a breeze. Though he would never admit it, my husband
  uses also (trimming mustash, nose hairs (eewww), shaving, etc.)
  Great product. Order one. You will not be dissapointed!</Text>
  <Text category="health">Not a bad product. Irritates the skin a
  little, but does remove your hair. The only things I don't like
  is that the buffers wear out quickly and your hair grows back
  with in 2 weeks. It does a nice job of exfoliating the skin and
  is great for hard to reach places. Not a bad product; however, I
  hope someone soon comes up with something that can take hair away
  permanently or for a longer period of time. I would recommend
  this product</Text>
  <Text category="health">Shaving gives me all sorts of problems, I
  must have super sensitive skin or something. I cannot afford
  laser and wax just isn't my thing. Grabbed this for myself before
  Christmas on a whim. It was money well spent! After 3 months of
  use, I have gotten the hang of the product. I suggest you
  practise then shave regularly for a month or more. Say, run the
  product over each leg once till you get used to it. Then trying
  to completely remove the hair. My legs are unbelievably soft. No
  rash, one little tender area after I spent too much time there.
  Do keep moving and keep a razor in the cabinet just in case. I
  still have trouble around my ankles. Hair regrowth is markedly
  thinner since I began using it. By about half. What remains still
  grows long but I'm, err, what does one call this process? - doing
  it once a week and only takes a few minutes</Text>
  <Text category="health">Really strong when just sprayed, but
  after a little while it gets soft, but at the same time not too
  soft. The perfume lasts for few hours, by the time I go to bed,
  the scent would still be there faintly, and I fall asleep to it.
  It is fresh and strong at first, then soft and sweet. LOVE
  IT</Text>
  <Text category="health">I ordered the HappyLite about 4 months
  before they even shipped the product, because it was the first
  reasonably priced (and sized) light to help treat SAD. Living in
  Minnesota, I tend to get depressed in February, so wanted to see
  if the light would help. Starting in Oct/Nov 2003, I began
  turning it on at desk height at my work for the suggested amount
  of time. I did not use it on weekends. Anyway, I think that it
  helped me keep from sinking so low with the SAD blues in
  February, but it did not completely keep SAD away. I spent 4 days
  on the beach in Florida during the 3rd week of February, and that
  helped the most. I will indeed use the light again this winter,
  because it helps--but does not eliminate--SAD for me</Text>
  <Text category="health">I first used this product when I got a
  straight razor shave in a men's salon awhile back. It really made
  for a smooth shave, which you definitely need when getting a
  straight razor shave. By the way, I don't recommend getting a
  straight razor shave on your wedding day as I foolishly did. Your
  face will be very sore. It took me 10 years before I got another
  straight razor shave, and I hated it as much as the first time.
  I'll never get another. However, this oil product made the shave
  tolerable, and it makes daily shaving fantastic. This combined
  with the aftershave moisturizer makes for an incredible shave.
  It's amazing how soft your skin feels afterward. Buy the oil and
  the moisturizing aftershave, and you won't be disappointed</Text>
  <Text category="health">Tis is the best joint supplement I have
  found on the market. Thank you Amazon for carrying it</Text>
  <Text category="health">I love that stuff! And now you haven't
  had it - but I need more - please make it available again.
  Thanks</Text>
  <Text category="health">Received my pack of 4 in 2 days with the
  free ship option. Shop-Rite sells individual box for 8.99, so
  even the regular price of $32 beat that. The $10 additional
  promotion was icing on the cake</Text>
  <Text category="health">Purchased a case of Bally Energy Drink
  since I seemed a bit sluggish after a 12 hour work day and kept
  making excuses NOT to work out. Gets me up and at em' and no more
  excuses for not going for a long walk or trip to the gym! Drank 1
  can in the morning @ 5:30 am and another around 3pm. Give it a
  try</Text>
  <Text category="health">This has an average scent. I have bought
  other brands of reed diffusers that I like alot more. I would not
  buy this again</Text>
  <Text category="health">Nice mirror. Good magnification. Solid
  construction. My only change would allow vertical adjustability
  to allow flexibility in positioning on the wall. I had to move a
  picture to position it at the correct height</Text>
  <Text category="health">I got this for my husband and he states
  that the trimmer is great but it needs to have a smaller base.
  The charger part of the trimmer is just too big. Even though it
  is big for size it does not hold all the attachments. He would
  recommend the trimmer to do the job it is intended for</Text>
  <Text category="health">I got the WaterPik JP-130 to replace a
  shower head that was set too low for my husband. Installation was
  easy enough, though, we had to purchase plumber's white tape to
  get a good seal. Other showerheads I've purchased have come with
  the tape included which is why I took off one star. The arm was
  long enough that my husband can step under it and still have
  clearance from the wall. It creates a soft fall of water that I
  really enjoy and the head is large enough that I am actually able
  to wash my hair more quickly as it hits more of my hair at one
  tim. I've not had any problems with the thumb screws and I have
  been move the unit quite often so that I can shave my legs. I've
  loved this product so far and would definitely purchase
  again.</Text>
  <Text category="health">just bought this showerhead I have a
  stand -up shower built in with a pull around curtain. all other
  heads blow the curtain out and water on the floor. this is the
  one. it works great. i have a shallow well pump with 40 -60lbs of
  water pressure setting. my wife loves this so much i will get one
  for her up stairs full shower bathtub</Text>
  <Text category="health">I got this showerhead for Christmas and
  am really happy with it!! It's really a pleasant experience to
  have the water raining down on you. I do agree with the other
  reveiwer that the adjustable knobs are tough to get to stay in
  place. But with mine anyways it stays in place while I'm using it
  and it's only later that it slowly lowers down. Then I just move
  it back into place and tighten the knobs again when I want to use
  it. It hasn't been any trouble so far. I love this showerhead so
  much that I'm actually already looking for an even larger one!! I
  highly recommend these "rainfall" showerheads!</Text>
  <Text category="health">Pik Stik reacher/grabber did exactly what
  it said. I used the 32 in size to pick up items from the floor
  and in the yard. I'm 5'4" and did not have to bend over to pick
  up things. It picks up coins, small pieces of paper, as well as
  jars, and leaves/gumballs from outdoors. I am completely
  satisfied</Text>
  <Text category="health">I had a horrible cold, felt like complete
  #### but I HAD to work. This little two ounce vitamin B shot
  knocked the crappy feeling outta me and I was able to get some
  work done. There really is no crash and the taste isn't that bad.
  ..it tastes like a melted freeze pop. NOTE: It may give you the
  jitters if you drink it on an empty stomach</Text>
  <Text category="health">Im a truck driver that dosent drink
  coffee. Can you believe it!? My hours are really weird as my day
  may start at 8AM or at 8PM &amp;amp; I might work for 10 to 14
  hours per shift. Ive used half a bottle to a full bottle at a
  time &amp;amp; have always gotten the boost I need to get where
  Im going. I also may use it to start my day or to finish it. I
  started using 5 hour about 6 months ago. I dont use it everyday
  but when I need it, it works well. The nice thing is, when I
  finally call it a day I can lay down &amp;amp; get to sleep.
  Unlike other products Ive used, I dont have that ragged feeling
  afterward. I purchase in quantities of 100 &amp;amp; carry 25 or
  so on the road.</Text>
  <Text category="health">recieved product on time, and i wil for

  <Text category="health">I have owned and broken most grabbers on
  the market. The fold-up Gopher is a joke, another, with a flimsy
  wire down the center breaks after too much use, and the
  heavy-duty unit from Lowes is hard on the wrist. This unit is the
  smart way to go! It is strong and durable and makes the most
  sense in the way it utilizes the strength of the hand and fingers
  and relieves pressure from the wrist. Also, it is exactly the
  correct length for a six foot man. No bending at the lumbar
  required</Text>
  <Text category="health">My mother in law thought it was
  reduculous to spend more that twenty bucks on one of these
  because she got one that has ocean sounds... birds.. ect. But all
  those other machines have that creepy digital sound for white
  noise...and the waves inevitably break and the birds stop
  chirping as soon as the car alarm goes off in the street. This is
  the only sound we need! We bought it for our 3 month old daughter
  because we live in a noisy part of the city and our neighbors
  kept waking her up. She slep great from day one... now we use it
  as part of her bedtime ritual.. bath, jammies, book, SLEEPY
  MACHINE... and off to sleep she goes</Text>
  <Text category="health">We originally got this to replace the
  "fan noise" in the winter due to our sons' room being so cold.
  The first couple days the sound seemed so loud but you quickly
  get used to it. We've discovered it's very helpful for blocking
  out the noise of other children running through the house while
  our newborn is sleeping in addition to the city noises at night.
  With the adjustability dials it's ideal for a nursery or bedroom
  for those who cannot sleep without a fan. It doesn't however,
  cover the sound of someone coughing or snoring loudly. Would
  highly recommend this to anyone looking for a sound machine for
  environmental noise, especially for children</Text>
  <Text category="health">This is the best sound machine out
  there.....I worked in a doctors office where they used these, and
  they were amazing. My husband cannot sleep without some sort of
  "white noise". We purchased this and our sleep couldn't be
  better. Best bet for the money. It's also adjustable as far as
  volume, just twist the top. Very quick shipping as well.</Text>
  <Text category="health">I don't know why most of the reviews are
  so negative. Mine works perfectly, it does not flip-flop, does
  not drop down and you can remove those thingies inside to make
  the water pressure higher for a more soothing shower experience.
  Reason I gave it 4 stars is because I have what is called a
  "diverter valve" attached to my shower head. The waterpik is
  meant to be installed DIRECTLY onto the shower head itself. I
  could not do that, because I have a portable "wand" that is
  moveable via hose connected to the valve and noticed that the
  threading is too short for the waterpik to latch on to. Went to
  Home Depot and got an extension and a coupling, kind of ingenious
  and used lots of pipe tape to "interface" the waterpik via the
  extension, via the coupling ONTO the diverter valve..... Wow! NO
  LEAKS! Works PERFECTLY. For those of you out there that has a
  diverter valve for more then one showerhead option, go to Home
  Depot, Lowe's or a hardware store and what I wrote above will
  work as it did for me. Enjoy</Text>

  <Text category="health">I purchased this size ramp to handle
  wheelchair access over the two-inch threshold to our house and it
  has done that, but I wish now that I had selected a size longer
  than 16 inches in order to have a more gradual incline. I use a
  power wheelchair with plenty of power but have found that the
  chair's direction becomes a little unstable when it reaches the
  top of the ramp due to the slope, necessitating careful
  maneuvering to continue in a straight line into the house. It was
  easy to install, however, with the included mounting screws and
  seems sturdy and durable</Text>
  <Text category="health">My hair is very wavy and frizzy, I have
  to condition my hair every day so it doesn't look dry and
  damaged. 2 weeks ago I got my hair cut, the stylist used a Sedu
  straightener on me. Wow! Suddenly, my hair was stick straight and
  super glossy (really brought out the natural highlights). I
  bought one from him for $199 (should have checked the Internet
  first). I've tried a cheap flat iron before; after wrestling with
  it for 40 minutes and pulling the heck out of my hair, all I got
  was slightly "pressed" hair. The Sedu iron has super smooth ionic
  plates, so it glides through your hair very easily, quickly and
  smoothly. No more pulling of my hair. I can give myself smooth,
  gorgeous, in about 5 minutes. Another plus is that the style will
  stay until the next time you wash your hair; Now i only have to
  straighten my hair every other day. Sure, Sedu is on the
  expensive side, but this salon-quality tool is more than worth
  it. Look good and feel good every day!</Text>
  <Text category="health">I read many reviews on this product and
  other products similiar to it before deciding on the Sedu. It
  took me a week to get the product and I anxiously tried it as
  soon as it arrived. I must say that the products is a dream come
  true. I am an African American woman and I have never been able
  to get my hair as straight as I am able to do now, not even when
  going to the salon. When I went back to work from the weekend, my
  coworkers all commented on how much longer my hair looked
  (because it was truly straight). I would recommend this to any
  woman. I have not been back to the salon in the last 2
  months</Text>
  <Text category="health">I like this kit very much and my
  colleague are going to purchase it when they saw mine</Text>
  <Text category="health">Calvin Klein's Obsession was one of the
  earliest releases in the designer fragrance craze, and it has
  since become a classic. Obsession is a warm, earthy, sensual
  scent. There is no floral or sweetness to it; rather, it has a
  musky, almost masculine quality with a bit of a vanilla note. The
  scent is gently seductive--alluring enough for romance, but also
  subtle enough for everyday wear. In has excellent staying power,
  as it lingers on the skin all day long. Although Obession has all
  of the qualities I usually like in a fragrance--I definitely
  prefer musky, spicy scents to more floral ones--for some reason,
  Obsession is not one of my favorites; although I do enjoy wearing
  it on occasion, I actually prefer stealing some of my husband's
  Obession for Men to wear for myself! Overall, however, Obsession
  for women is a classic fragrance that I would definitely
  recommend</Text>
  <Text category="health">For years I have had many a vacation
  ruined because I break out in hives with very little exposure to
  the sun. After my dermatologist recommended this product I tried
  it. Two vacations later . . . Not a single hive or sunburn. Well
  worth the price. Actually goes pretty far also</Text>
  <Text category="health">I've been using this for the last 3
  months and I'm a very satisfied customer. I get a very close
  shave, and no razor bumpors. I'm Afircan American and my beard is
  coarse and curly, sometimes with many razor this can lead to
  ingrown hair problems. I highly recommend this, because it's a
  much close shave than the typical elctric razors by brands such
  as Braun and Norelic. It's very cheap and the only maintainence
  is clipper oil. I cam across these because the only time I would
  get a great shave was at the barber. When he used clippers on me
  I've never had any problems with ingrown hair, therefore I
  decided to own my own pair of clippers. I'm very pleased with
  with product and highly recommended as a very effective and
  affordable method for shaving and trimming</Text>
  <Text category="health">Didn't work if you dont take the full
  recommended amount. It may have helped me feel fuller, but it
  didnt help me lose any weight. I pulled out the old excersize
  bike and am plugging away at a low 20 min a day now. I still use
  it for the caffeien and possible apetite control benefit</Text>
  <Text category="health">I was having a problem with over-eating
  and eating when I wasn't hungry and as a result, gained quite a
  bit of weight, and felt awful. I've only been using this product
  for three days, but already my portion size has shrunk immensely
  and my energy is way up. I haven't felt jittery or shaky. I feel
  better than I have in months. I would recommend this to those who
  also have problems with cravings or portion size and want to drop
  some un-needed weight</Text>
  <Text category="health">I was skeptical about this product but
  tried it anyway. It does work and it does eliminate the dip in
  the middle our mattress had formed. This has given our mattress a
  little more life so it will last a little longer until it's time
  to give in and buy a new one</Text>
  <Text category="health">This product was nothing short of
  miraculous for me. I'm in my early forties now with skin that has
  been trouble-prone since I hit my teens...and while I have used
  various and sundry products to control breakouts from acne and
  rosacea (which started about age 40), including retin A cream,
  topical and systemic antibiotics, and every sort of over the
  counter cleanser, these treatments helps but if anything my
  breakouts were coming closer together and getting more severe as
  I aged. I've been using the mask for about 8 mos and my skin is
  the nicest and most healthy it's been in many years....I had
  rapid improvement of both my regular acne and the rosacea on top
  of it. Caution - I've never had any benzoyle peroxide
  sensitivity. People who are irritated by benzoyle peroxide
  probably won't have the same kind of experience I do. BP creams
  have always helped, but were not as effective as this mask, which
  really gets down in the pores. I use it heavily. I apply it
  either before I brush my teeth or before I get in the shower. It
  is cool and refreshing. I usually let it sit as a mask for a few
  minutes before I rinse off, although sometimes I use it just as a
  cleanser when my skin needs freshening...like after I've walked
  through a cloud of someones cigarette smoke. It leaves my skin
  very, very clean, and *soft.* I have never had any dryness or
  irritation from this product at all...indeed, my skin has become
  less sensitive and reactive and is calm and feels good when it
  used to be angry and irritated all the time. The dryness others
  warn of has never been an issue for me. it makes my skin feel
  like normal healthy skin. Working outside in the heat or cleaning
  in a dusty, dirty environment used to cause my skin to break out.
  Now before cleaning or working I will actually put a bit of this
  mask on- wne I am done, my skin is none the worse the wear for
  the activity... I stay clear and smooth. I guess it blocks the
  irritants or stops the sebaceous glands from making my pores
  either block or become a haven for bacteria. I do not have
  serious acne all over my body...just a very trouble prone face
  for most of my adult life. The benzoyle peroxide mask has ended
  this trouble for me. I simply smooth a couple times a day for
  about the time it takes to brush teeth, and wash it off. No
  prescriptions, no panicked spot treatment of painful blemishes or
  pustules...just perfect skin for me. Amazing!!!</Text>
  <Text category="health">I was hesitant to spend this much money
  on a shaver but I am so glad I did. This one gives me a really
  good shave. I have had it for one month and have not used a hand
  razor since. Another review says the cleaning process is a bit
  loud, which it is but since you turn it on and leave it, I just
  close the bathroom door so the noise is not a problem.</Text>
  <Text category="health">I bought this Obus Forme king sized
  pillow because I thought it might stop my snoring. I must admit
  to being surprised that the pillow actually did minimize my night
  time rattling if not eliminate it completely. There have been
  reviews that mentioned the pillow had a strange odor at first. I
  found that it did give off a smell similar to that of a new
  carpet or some plastics, but that disappeared in just a few days
  and was never offensive. My wife wanted to try my pillow and
  liked it so much she kept it. I have just ordered a second
  pillow.</Text>
  <Text category="health">These are great glasses, easy to put on
  and take off, and are there around your neck waiting for you to
  use them. I saw them on the CSI NY coroner on TV and had to find
  some. Amazon was the place to go</Text>
  <Text category="health">The product smells really good, is very
  affordable and helps maintain my hair style all day. I highly
  recommend trying it. I will make it part of my daily hairdress
  (grooming) for life!</Text>
  <Text category="health">I bought this straightner at Walmart for
  about the same price found on amazon and I really like it. I
  bought it mostly to curl my hair like my stylist does. I wanted a
  chi, but I couldn't pass this one up for the price. I 've only
  used it a couple of times but it straightens well and can be used
  to curl my hair as well. A good product for the price!!</Text>
  <Text category="health">I bought this for my husband. He had a
  plantars wart on the bottom of his foot that was removed but
  became a callus that gave him pain. Emu oil is the first thing
  that softened it and it is better than it has ever been and he
  had suffered with it for years</Text>
  <Text category="health">NV diet pills are working great for me- I
  lost 8lbs in a month!!! they work as long as you eat healthy and
  exercise regularly while taking the pills. It isn't a miracle
  pill so if you take it but eat nonstop all day and don't work
  out, of course nothing is going to happen. They really do control
  hunger because I take 2 a day and one day I was busy and forgot
  to take my 2nd pill and I was STARVING looking to eat anything
  and everything in sight</Text>
  <Text category="health">Great piece of equipment, no guessing how
  accurate the scale might be with this great Healthometer</Text>
  <Text category="health">Having struggled with digital scales that
  broke after a few years, I finally decided to get the scale my
  doctor has. It's terrific because I can see it clearly (the
  numbers are right in my face) and it is built to last forever! My
  daughter and I assembled it with a minimum of effort. The
  directions are written clearly and all adjustments are super easy
  to handle. It is clearly the best scale I've ever owned. The down
  side is that it needs a bit more space than a regular floor
  scale. You can, however, buy a piece of plywood and put the scale
  on top of the wood in a carpeted room if your bathroom can't
  handle the bigger size</Text>
  <Text category="health">We use these in all of our humidifiers
  and they do a great job</Text>
  <Text category="health">This is very soothing for people with
  arthritis or any kind of injury and makes your hand feel
  wonderful</Text>
  <Text category="health">I love them! I have a fairly expensive 6
  piece lithograph and each piece is about 15 lbs. We were not only
  able to hang them with minimal damage to the drywall but have
  them almost perfectly abutting each other</Text>
  <Text category="health">They taste good and stop those hunger
  pangs for quite some time</Text>
  <Text category="health">I read in one of the magazines, that many
  stars in Hollywood eat chocolate to lose weight. I thought, that
  was some kind of cruel joke, until I read that the chocolate they
  eat is with hoodia, but I could not find the name for those
  chocolates. I searched the internet, and was I happy to find
  Chocoleans! I was going out on a date to my favorite sushi place,
  and had one chocolean before I left the house. It worked! I could
  barely finish two sushi's and I felt soo full. Now I eat one or
  two chocoleans a day with water or coffee, and eat soo much less!
  I already lost two dress sizes, amazing. And, they are sooo
  delicious</Text>
  <Text category="health">I haven't actually used the bottles sent
  to me as of yet but used this product all last summer. I love the
  fact that the Blue Lizard Suncream stays on so well. My kids can
  swim and stay at the beach for hours and Blue Lizard does the
  trick!!! I don't think they got burnt one time last year while I
  was using this. Great Product!!</Text>
  <Text category="health">this is the best bargain for your
  money.pampers swaddlers are better than pampers. even better than
  costco brand. worth every penny</Text>
  <Text category="health">These are the best diapers I have used.
  They are soft, flexible, and easily adjustable for a good secure
  fit. They hold leaks extremely well. Of course leaks do occur
  (why wouldn't they if your baby has, say for example, 4 explosive
  poops in the course of 5 minutes....it's happened), however this
  is to be expected. They do not occur regularly and the diapers
  are not saggy, but fit very snuggly which provides for good
  protection. I HIGHLY recommend these</Text>
  <Text category="health">The magnet is solid, the frame wiggle
  perfectly to make it clic and fit just like the picture shows.
  Lenses are clear and functional. However, they need to give a bit
  more space to accomodate larger heads, since it can get snug and
  this is NOT your usual glasses. Notice that the frame encircles
  the head, making head size an issue. On the plus side- the
  glasses won't fall off when you bend forward, they stay around
  your neck after you unclick 'em, and they are functional</Text>
  <Text category="health">I had my original clic readers for about
  six years before I had to replace them. I love the quality of the
  lenses, the ease of use and the fact that I do not have to
  remember where I put them when I took them off. I never take them
  off and have even ordered several pair for other people at work.
  I am a carpenter and other than having to clean sawdust that
  accumulates on them once in a while, find them to be one of the
  most useful tools I own.</Text>
  <Text category="health">If you don't like getting attention,
  these are not for you. I'm often surprised by people's astonished
  reactions to the act of putting them on and taking them off; I'm
  so accustomed to pulling them apart, that I forget how unusual
  the viewing public finds it. I have been wearing Clics for nearly
  a year. I pretend that I don't need glasses, but of course I do
  and have for nearly a decade. Popped the standard diopter lenses
  out, and put in my bifocal prescription. It worked great, despite
  a warning from my optical shop. (And even if they had broken from
  the experiment, the price is right: I could try it again.)
  Previously I was wearing glasses on a chain. Besides the various
  difficulties noted by another reviewer, I also found that the
  plastic loops that connect the chain to the arms of the glasses
  have a bad habit of stretching. Then the glasses slip off the
  chain at inappropriate times and the frames break. I call the
  color of mine "magenta" - which may or may not be the same as the
  online "red" - I bought them in a shop (**gasp**). My short hair
  is not a problem, but I agree that reading in bed doesn't work.
  So I use a different pair for those occasions</Text>
  <Text category="health">These glasses are a great idea. However,
  they do not work with long hair. The back "strap" of the glasses
  has to ride high up on the back of the head for the lenses to
  rest low on the nose (so you can see over them for distance).
  Long hair lays on the back of the glasses and pushes them down in
  the back, making the front of the glasses pop up and placing the
  lenses right in front of the eyes. I guess most people who need
  reading glasses don't have long hair</Text>
  <Text category="health">I loved this product, really leaves my
  hair really straight without even blow drying!! I have curly hair
  and it worked pretty well, my hair was smooth and shiny, I'm very
  happy with my straightener</Text>
  <Text category="health">I like this product a lot. My hair type
  is curly and frizzy specially after the hair gets dried up
  naturally after the head bath. I used this product and my hair
  looks good now. It looks smooth and straight now and I can feel
  the softness when I touch my hair. I definitely will recommend
  this product to my friends.....</Text>
  <Text category="health">omgosh i cannot tell you how much i love
  this straightener. it makes my hair SO SOFT its like baby bottom
  soft or when u sand wood for a really really long time. i LOVE
  it. i use it everymorning.. at night i use the wet setting to dry
  off my hair and then in the mroning i finish it off with the dry
  settting. but i also use sunsilk pink bottle 24/7 creme. its an
  absolute must-have. to the person who gave it one star.. maybe
  yours was a defect. im sure everyone else who has rated it so far
  loved it. did you straighten it section by section? it doesnt
  work if you do it all at once. i recommend this straightener! its
  not that expensive and also makes a great christmas gift. looks
  nice too. enjoy</Text>
  <Text category="health">i normally have severe pain in my neck
  especially when i first get up in the morning causing extremely
  painful headaches and migraines. this pillow has kept my neck in
  a suitable position, eliminating about 70-90% of my
  problems</Text>
  <Text category="health">I was suffering from intense neck and
  shoulder pain before I started using this pillow. When I started
  sleeping on it a couple of months ago, the pain was gone after
  the first night, and it hasn't come back since then. It supports
  my neck perfectly. I highly recommend</Text>
  <Text category="health">I've been relying on this lotions for
  over a decade. Of the many I've tried, it's the only one that
  provides both immediate dryness relief and long-lasting
  moisturizing. Some may find the initial glycerin slickness to be
  excessive, especially on hands, but if you have skin as dry as
  mine you'll tolerate a minute or two of "greasiness" for the
  softness and comfort that lasts for hours. These comments are for
  Neutrogena Emulsion only -- Neutrogena Body Lotion did not work
  well for me</Text>
  <Text category="health">Over the past two years I have been using
  several different green food products to try to find one that has
  a reasonable taste and seems to satisfy my physical needs. At age
  70 those needs are many. After approximately two rounds of
  trying, it is Miracle Greens that has been most consistant in
  good taste and at the same time satisfying many of the needs I
  have for feeling better in general</Text>
  <Text category="health">Bumble &amp;amp; Bumble products are a
  special "me" treat for pampering. The shampoo is mild and keeps
  my long, permed hair in great shape</Text>
  <Text category="health">I have several of these glasses now. Love
  them. They are strong and adjustable and so much better then
  wearing the granny cord around your neck. I wish there was a
  berrer looking sunglass besides that goggle looking one. Good
  price and good product.</Text>
  <Text category="health">I saw these reading glasses on CSI:NY and
  just had to have them! It's really nice to have a quality pair of
  reading glasses...and the WOW factor doesn't hurt either! I've
  read some of the reviews and can see where women with hair past
  their shoulders might have a problem with this type of glasses.
  My hair is shortish (layered to the bottom of my neck) and I
  wouldn't want it any longer if I was going to wear these glasses
  a lot...which I do! They aren't portable...but they aren't
  supposed to be. I keep mine in my office where I need to take
  them on and off the most frequently. I'll probably get another
  pair for home but I'll used my old ones I can put in my case for
  carrying in my purse. All in all...I'm very glad I got
  them</Text>
  <Text category="health">This is the longest period of time that
  my husband has kept a pair of reading glasses. The Click readers
  loop around his neck and are always there when he needs them. He
  gets lots of comments about how neat they are</Text>
  <Text category="health">This isn't a product thats going to get
  you laid after she sniffs it a couple of times. It's starts the
  chat and dialog. What it does do is start the conversation and
  keep you the their target. M-11 kicks up the yackity yak in her
  with you being the focus. I;ve tried a few of them including that
  90 dollar rip off thats advertised in Popular Science, and this
  is product works just fine. Give it a go guys. It gets you past
  that awkward dork moment when you are trying to talk about
  somthing other that what Starbucks you hang at. Its not a sex
  pill so forget it. But, it will open up the road you need to walk
  down to get to the garden of eden or whatever. So don't be a
  little whimp. Be a man and give it a go. Its a way to the women
  you want via the mental route. Yes, you have to think. It will
  work for you so do it</Text>
  <Text category="health">I wanted a cordless shaver because at my
  age (49) I need my glasses on to see the hairs I'm shaving, and
  that doesn't work well in the shower! This Braun is a good buy,
  easy to use, and works well if you follow the directions and
  shave slowly. It's not as close or smooth as a blade and shaving
  gel, but it's quicker and less mess, so I think it's a good
  trade-off.</Text>
  <Text category="health">The Ultrasonic Aromatheropy Fountain is
  really unique. The sound generated, yet unheard, causes water to
  spring up from the surface 3-4 inches to provide a fountain-like
  water sound. At the same time, the frequency of the sound waves
  create a plesant cool misty fog that slowly boils over the sides
  and out along the surface it is sitting on. All the while, led
  lights under the water slowly change seemingly to all colors. The
  construction was just a little light duty other than that, Very
  Nice</Text>
  <Text category="health">I've had this trimmer for 10 years and
  never had a problem. Sometimes the switch needs to be moved twice
  but it always works. Never falls apart and cut hair great. I'd
  buy another if this one would ever wear out!</Text>
  <Text category="health">Most reviewers on this site are
  unenthusiastic about this particular product. I think the main
  reason for that level of dissatisfaction is, as someone else
  suggested, that people need to pay attention to how, exactly,
  this trimmer works. Because of its design, best results are
  obtained when it is inserted, withdrawn, then inserted again, and
  the procedure repeated. Second tip: rinse the rotating blade,
  switched ON, under the HOT tap to remove accumulated hair, etc,
  after each use. It works better when clean. The main PLUS of this
  product is its size. Yes, it is flimsy, made in China, and would
  probably sell for $2.50 if it didn't say Panasonic on it - or
  come with a 12-month Panasonic warranty. But it works very well
  if you use it right and keep it clean. I have had mine a couple
  of years and the only problem is that the blade is now dull and
  replacement blades are apparently not available</Text>
  <Text category="health">I really like this curling iron...- and
  you definitely can't beat the price! It heats up very quickly,
  and gives me great curls. The key to working with large barrel
  curls are to use a mouse or cream to texturize your hair. Then,
  after you curl, make sure to take a blowdryer on cold/low setting
  to lock the curls down. I always receive so many compliments on
  my hair!!</Text>
  <Text category="health">I am a big fan of 2" curling irons, but
  they can be difficult to find. My last one (different brand) wore
  out a couple years ago and I had a hard time finding a
  replacement until now. I have shoulder length hair, fairly thick,
  plus wavy and frizzy. 2" curling irons do a great job of
  smoothing and straightening my hair, while also turning it under
  (or up, if desired) at the ends for a nice, finished look. I find
  it much easier and faster than using a traditional flat/straight
  iron while achieving superior results. You will not get "curl"
  with this curling iron. You will get smooth hair quickly and
  easily. Highly recommended</Text>
  <Text category="health">I was searching for a two inch curling
  iron for a while. I have had so -so dealings with Gold N Hot in
  the past so I was a little nervous but I purchased this one
  anyway. So far, so good. It's surprisingly light (at least
  compared to my one inch ceramic tools curling iron). I usually
  let my hair air dry and use my curling irons to straighten my
  hair as I curl the ends (I'm black with a relaxer.) I have yet to
  do it with this one. Although I might try b/c it gets really hot.
  (I usually have it on around 20-25 out of 30) The only problem is
  that the ceramic can chip off (It happened with the first one I
  bought, but I returned it and got a new one that hasn't chipped
  so far) and it's so big that if you take your thumb off the
  spring grip, it can be hard to get it back on (I have huge hands
  too.</Text>
  <Text category="health">After brushing with the HydraBrush, my
  teeth feel as clean as when I've been to the dental hygenist.
  This is a great product. I am so glad that replacement brushes
  are available at Amazon</Text>
  <Text category="health">Una de las mejores compras que he hecho,
  es facil de manejar y deja el cabello liso y con brillo... Es
  fantastica</Text>
  <Text category="health">WHat I like best is that it is non
  addictive. It puts you right to sleep within 20-30 minutes. It
  really helped me and my boyfriend regulate our sleep
  patterns</Text>
  <Text category="health">Sedamine is great sleep aid. I've been
  dealing with no sleep problems for about 8 months and I tried
  nearly everything including old remedies-I thought I would go
  crazy if I didn't find help. Not sleeping has been awful. Since
  end of July I started with the Sedamine product and it started
  working right way. I tell anyone to try it cause it help me it
  help anyone.</Text>
  <Text category="health">I have a pretty complicating sleep
  schedule because of my graveyard shift at our local convenient
  store, with school and all it's kind of hard keeping my sleep
  schedule straight. I've tried many sleep aids and this one worked
  the best for me, no grogginess which is totally awesome for the
  days I have class early!</Text>
  <Text category="health">the pills really do work. I stopped
  taking stacker over a year ago and i stopped my routine workouts
  and i gained 40 lbs in just one year! I was so frustrated and
  dissapointed at myself so i started going to the gym but i was
  finding it hard to motivate myself to do anything while at the
  gym. I just started taking stacker3 for one week and already i
  have dropped almost 10 lbs (of course with excersise as well)
  This pill not only helps with energy but as i have read, it also
  works as a metabolism enhancing property! Thank you NVE for a
  great product. THe only negative thing about it is that i
  sometimes feel dizzy and a numbness to my fingers. (that was the
  reason i stopped taking it in the first place but its really not
  life threatening or as serious as it may sound)</Text>
  <Text category="health">We have a "closet shower", which made it
  difficult to get out of the way of the water spray (not to
  mention having water spray out the door). We picked up this neat
  little shower head, and we're much happier now. You can avoid the
  water more easily (for shaving, washing body, etc.), and since it
  aims straight down, no more turning the shower head all the way
  to the side to avoid it going right out the door. It's
  inexpensive, and has made our shower experience much better. I
  definitely recommend it</Text>
  <Text category="health">I have had this model for years! And I
  cut my hair with it 3-4 times a month between me &amp;amp; my
  sons. It is the best clipper set I have ever owned. Most clippers
  I buy only last 1-2 years. I have had this one I think 5-6 years!
  Well worth the money</Text>
  <Text category="health">Wow! I'm really impressed! I've had
  trouble cleaning under my bridge. I can fish floss under there
  and clean it good, but it takes a lot of time. Now I just blast
  it clean in minutes. It does a good job of cleaning my back
  teeth. I've never been totally satisfied with just flossing. Now
  they feel perfectly clean. I love this device! It doesn't replace
  flossing. It does a great job under the gums, but I still feel
  cleaner after flossing. It's great as a between brushing
  "touchup". I recommend it to anyone. My mouth hasn't felt this
  clean in years. I feel like I've come from the Dentist after a
  cleaning. Thats a great feeling to have every day</Text>
  <Text category="health">This was my first purchase of Seventh
  Generation products and it won't be my last one. I was very
  impressed with the cleaning and it is just as good as those not
  so earth friendly competitors. I feel good using their products
  and have also ordered their fabric softner, dishwasher liquid,
  dishwashing liquid, bleach, paper towels, and toilet paper. I'm
  not a treehugger but do care about my environment and feel a duty
  to make earth a better place to be</Text>
  <Text category="health">It's pretty good...don't see it making
  anything "firmer" but it works nicely as a moisturizer. I checked
  the internet and apparently the person posting stuff above has
  been posting the same thing [about it ruining their life] all
  over the net. Probably an allergic reaction, you always have to
  test a little piece of skin before slopping something in your
  eyes ;</Text>
  <Text category="health">I have over 60 mens fragrances that range
  from $50.00 to $320.00 and found that I get more compliments when
  I wear this fragrance than any other fragrance that I wear as
  well as having an risque appealing bottle. Great must-have for
  any man</Text>
  <Text category="health">I found this product to be very unique,
  and helpful, in that I could quickly remove &amp;amp; retain the
  glasses around my neck. Being far-sighted, I have come to need
  reading glasses, and these are perfect for my needs. I can look
  'down' through them, and look 'over the frame' for distance, all
  while they are secured around my head and neck. I do hiking,
  using a GPS device, and these glasses allow me to look down at
  the GPS device in my hand, while also looking forward towards my
  path of travel. Thank you for the innovative product</Text>
  <Text category="health">My husband was leaving more than 20 pairs
  of reading glasses everywhere and any where and could still never
  find a pair when he needed them....even to ead a menu! These
  glasses are the answer to anyone who wears reading glasses. I
  bought them in all colors for him and even bought a pair work a
  friend who works with him(he loves them as well and bought in
  more colors also). Neither of them have lost a pair in all of
  these months. They also have started so many conversations.
  Everyone who has asked about them has done the same and have
  bought in all colors. It takes a little adjusting and getting use
  to but everyone we know has never returned a pair. Only reason
  they have returned was to order in more colors or to order for
  friends and loved ones! These glasses are fantastic! Thanks for
  the great service</Text>
  <Text category="health">I love the idea of the glasses always
  being where I can find them. The only problem is they need to
  also be adjustable for how wide the band is. Every time I look up
  the magnets pop apart. If they fix that, I'd give them 5 stars
  !!</Text>
  <Text category="health">My husband was totally delighted with the
  Rollator Walker. It is so much easier to use than the typical
  walker that we had to wonder why anyone wouldn't want this new,
  much more attractive kind. It folds up very easily when not in
  use and the basket comes in very handy for carrying things. When
  folded up it fits in the back seat of our car, and it would
  probably fit in the trunk if your truck is fairly large. We put
  it together in about 5 minutes and the price was great, what more
  can you ask</Text>
  <Text category="health">I ordered this walker for my father a few
  months ago and am well-pleased. It is much less expensive than
  comparable walkers. The cushioned seat and basket are handy for
  long "trips" and the wheels roll smoothly even over grassy areas.
  A good buy for someone looking for a quality walker. Even ships
  for free</Text>
  <Text category="health">This product rocks , if you are serious
  about body building this is a must have ...I've been using
  NO-Explode about two weeks and seen some serious enhanchments..
  First of my workout lasts at least an hour longer than usual and
  still have energy left over . Combine this product with the right
  amount of protein shake you are good to go...also note that this
  product does not cause any stomach cramping or aching like other
  creatine products do and tastes great</Text>
  <Text category="health">This product is ridiculous!! Not in a bad
  way but ridiculous in the fact that my first time taking a
  serving I felt twice the energy, twice the bloodflow and three
  times as ready to hit the gym. My first thoughts, "well maybe
  it's because my body isn't used to it yet". Well, four tubs later
  I had dropped two pants sizes (32 to a 28), gained 15lbs in pure
  muscle and still have the exact same effects as I did the first
  serving!! Not only that, I have passed this little known
  supplement on to friends and they have all said the same exact
  thing. OMG!! I only work out to stay in shape but with this
  product many people are telling me I look like I workout

  <Text category="health">these wipes are great. i have three
  children and have used the pampers, huggies, and house-brand
  wipes. the huggies are too thick and it seems you need more of
  them to get the job done. house-brand don't smell as good and
  tend to be a bit rough. the pampers are thin, soft, and moist
  enough to get the job done-because they are thin, they can be
  maneuvered around in all the important places and folded /
  refolded for 100% useage (unlike the huggies that once they are
  folded they become too thick to maneuver). definitely not too dry
  as other reviewers have said. if you want something moister, go
  get a paper towel and wet it with water</Text>
  <Text category="health">The shampoo doesn't lather. But it has a
  nice subtle scent that lasts all day. And it seems to be doing
  it's job at fighting dandruff since my hair has been itch-free
  since I started using it. So I would recommend it</Text>

  <Text category="health">I have three types of headlamps and I
  like this one the most. Here is why: 1) it's cheap, 2) it runs a
  long time on three AAA batteries, and 3) the red light is
  awesome. You can use the red light and still keep your "night
  vision". I use it to read in bed becasue it is not as visible or
  distracting to others as a white light. My only problem with it
  is that the knobs are a little confusing, even after two years of
  use. I often have to twist twice to get the right setting. And
  I'm usually good at that stuff</Text>
  <Text category="health">Fantastic, a great product, especially
  considering the price. I love the size. I love that the height is
  adjustable. It is exactly what I wanted, and I am thrilled with
  it.</Text>
  <Text category="health">I love the taste of these little

  dinner and be completely satisfied</Text>
  <Text category="health">I absolutely love this little book light.
  It is so slim and easy to store, plus I can use it for my

  <Text category="health">I use and like most all of the Olay lines

  <Text category="health">I carry a lot of tension in my neck and

  using the Real-Ease for about two months, and have found it very

  only when I already have a headache. If something happened to the
  one I have, I would definitely buy another</Text>

  <Text category="health">Saved my love life, literally. It worked

  tried everything. Thanks Princereign</Text>
  <Text category="health">I found this product to be very unique,
  and helpful, in that I could quickly remove &amp;amp; retain the
  glasses around my neck. Being far-sighted, I have come to need
  reading glasses, and these are perfect for my needs. I can look
  'down' through them, and look 'over the frame' for distance, all
  while they are secured around my head and neck. I do hiking,
  using a GPS device, and these glasses allow me to look down at
  the GPS device in my hand, while also looking forward towards my
  path of travel. Thank you for the innovative product</Text>
  <Text category="health">I love the idea of the glasses always
  being where I can find them. The only problem is they need to
  also be adjustable for how wide the band is. Every time I look up
  the magnets pop apart. If they fix that, I'd give them 5 stars

  <Text category="health">I found this product after reading a
  review of it on hairboutique.com. The length of my hair seemed to
  have reached a plateau just below my shoulders and after year
  seemed to have grown no longer. I decided to try this product to
  see if it worked. As hair growth is normally clocked at an 1/8 of
  an inch per month, I decided to monitor the results in my own
  little "clinical test." This was actually pretty easy because I
  colour my hair so I'd easily be able to see how much growth there
  was each month. I ordered a box of Viviscal for which I paid $49
  for (average price on the web) and the was set to take the first
  pill the following morning (the box recommends 2 per day). I
  coloured my hair the night before so that in one month I'd be
  able to accurately measure how much growth there had been by
  looking at the growth since the colouring. Results: I didn't
  really notice anything until around the 2 week time frame. I
  noticed my nails were growing very fast/very long. I have weak
  nails that split easily and they barely seem to grow at all. It
  was very noticeable because I use the computer all day and the
  nail growth was causing my fingers to constantly slip on the
  keyboard. Never having great nails, I was pretty happy to see
  this. My curiosity was also getting the better of me as I could
  see the roots of my hair pretty clearly which was unusual at 2
  weeks after coloring. I took the tape measure and measured almost
  1/4 of an inch in hair growth. This would mean 1/2 inch per month
  and 6 inches per year. I was pretty excited because although the
  numbers seemed small, it was twice the rate my hair normally
  grows. But I also noticed something else. My hair was becoming
  unusually greasy. Because I have very dry hair, I normally only
  wash it 2-3 times a week. But every other day it seemed much more
  greasy than normal. Hmmm. Well, at the 1 month time frame I
  measured my hair growth and it was exactly 3/4 of an inch. Not
  only that but I was constantly trimming my nails at this point. I
  was totally ecstatic. But also by this point, I was washing my
  hair every day - it was no longer dry and brittle, it was much
  softer, but there was no way I could miss a day of washing it or
  it would be greasy. So - the conclusions I have reached from my
  test was this: 1. Yes, Viviscal works. It caused my hair growth
  to be stimulated at over twice the speed. 2. Viviscal also makes
  your nails much stronger and grow much faster. 3. Viviscal makes
  your hair greasy, causing you to have to wash it every day - and
  then it's fine. It did not cause any extra hair growth anywhere
  else, which I thought a bit strange (though good!!!). I recommend
  this product</Text>
  <Text category="health">As a reviewer of the Hitachi Magic Wand,
  I can say that this Accuvibe seems just as adaquate to do the
  job, the plus is that this can be used with or without the power
  cord. Perhaps just not as powerfull as the Hatachi but pretty dam
  comparable if not the same, the cordless battery operation is
  worth the trade off. As mentioned it does the job</Text>
  <Text category="health">While some of Larabars have a thick

  <Text category="health">Old Spice Classic is far and away the
  best deodorant I've ever used. It goes on clean, unlike those
  "powdery" white deodorants. It also has a great fragrance and
  longevity after application. I think a lot of that is due to the
  high alcohol content; if you look at the ingredients, you'll see
  that alcohol is listed first. In fact, the container sports a
  "flammable" warning. The alcohol really does work well to contain
  odor. Alcohol-based deodorants are pretty hard to find, so I'm
  thankful this product is still being made</Text>
  <Text category="health">This shaver is the best shaver I have

  <Text category="health">This is the best shaver I've ever used.
  It shaves closer and quicker than the many Norelcos I've used,
  all of which costed a lot more than the R-960. The only
  improvement I'd like to see is in the battery, which does not
  really maintain its strength well between charges</Text>
  <Text category="health">This is a great shaver. If you are in the
  market for one, considered the Remington R-960. I am of
  Afro-American descent and was very skeptical about buying a
  rotary we shaver. I had always gotten excellent results using
  Remington shavers that were of the micro thin type to tackle the
  tough turf around my mug. With its ergonomic design, it was very
  easy to manipulate the shaver around in tough areas. I had
  considered purchasing that of another brand until I discovered
  that Remington makes one and now... I'm loving it</Text>
  <Text category="health">We needed something for our baby's room
  so that we wouldn't have to tip-toe around the house while she
  was napping. We ordered this item based on the great reviews, but
  didn't really know what to expect. It's much like the noise
  produced by a small fan, but without blowing air. It has two
  speeds, and complete control over the volume and pitch by
  adjustment of the louvers. Some reviews we read said it was not
  loud enough. I can't imagine that being a problem as we have it
  on the quietest setting (louvers completely closed, and low
  speed) and it's perfect. On high it's PLENTY loud for a device
  used while sleeping. This product did the trick for us, and I
  would recommend it to anybody with a light-sleeping baby</Text>
  <Text category="health">Recently got my SleepMate and it is very
  effective. Somehow it blocks out most sounds outside of my
  bedroom, and I don't have any trouble sleeping. I use to wake up
  at least 2-3 times a night, and have the hardest time getting
  back to sleep. I hardly ever wake up at all now. Great product,
  and I'd definately recommend it to anyone in need of a good
  night's sleep</Text>
  <Text category="health">I bought this as a present for my mother

  recomend this for anyone who enjoys having thier feet
  massaged</Text>
  <Text category="health">I wasn't sure what to expect when I 1st

  <Text category="health">A friend of mine used to meet me for
  lunch while boasting a beautiful &amp;amp; glowing face from a
  $50.00 facial she had just received. This product (even after the
  1st use) produced the same results &amp;amp; I never had to leave
  my home. My skin always goes through hell during the winter
  months when its continually exposed to artificial heat. My skin
  feels &amp;amp; looks like I've lost about 7 years time. I'm
  very, very pleased with Olay. I've used their Total Effects
  lotion for years &amp;amp; I did purchase the regenerist serum to
  apply after using the kit. This is an excellent exfoliant
  &amp;amp; hands down, the best skin regenerating product I've
  ever used</Text>
  <Text category="health">I've been using regenerist daily for 6
  months. I added the peel system this past month. What a change!
  I'm 60. My skin has clarity I haven't seen in years. Pores close
  up, small lines and wrinkles really do seem to disappear. I'll
  stick with this from now on</Text>
  <Text category="health">After going back and forth between Oil of
  Olay and Neutrogena I settled on this product mostly because of
  the price (plus no one complained about the granules getting into
  their eyes.) I'm happy with the results- my skin is softer and
  appears to have taken on more clarity. The orange smell is lovely
  and it only takes two minutes (I do it in the shower.) Of course,
  it's not microdermabrasian, but it is a great exfolliater for
  your skin</Text>
  <Text category="health">I love this product. It just tastes great
  especially with milk.</Text>
  <Text category="health">We used this for my newborn daughter up
  until 3 months when her digestive system finally started to
  mature enough to not have gas frequently. As a previous reviewer
  stated, sometimes it works, sometimes not, so I combined it with
  the recommended dosage for Infant Gas Drops and that would do the
  trick. I found Little Tummy's brand at Babies-R-Us, which is less
  expensive and is the same thing. Later, after 6 months and trying
  new foods, there has been a couple of occasions when you could
  tell something didn't agree with her. I gave her the recommended
  dosage for her age and she'd clearly feel better</Text>
  <Text category="health">Delivers moist heat. Great large size.
  You won't find anything larger anywhere.VERY relaxing as lavender
  is calming. Only problem is it only stay warm enough for 10 min
  and heat really should be applied for 20 minutes. I have placed a
  heating pad underneath in it the last 10 min. and lied down with
  head &amp;amp; neck in comfortable position and it did a great
  job. Pricey but worth it</Text>
  <Text category="health">Received the monitor quickly. It works
  well. The automatic feature is great.</Text>
  <Text category="health">I found this blood pressure meter easy to
  use and quite accurate when checked against my doctors readings.
  Keeping the readings in memory made it very easy to keep my
  doctor inform of the results. The size of the cuff is very
  important, so be sure to order the right size for your arm as the
  wrong size will give inaccurate results. This is true in the
  doctors office also. My blood pressure dropped several points in
  the doctors office, on his machine, just by changing the size of
  the cuff. This is an excellent monitor - I couldn't be happier
  with it. It is nice to be able to use it with batteries
  too.</Text>
  <Text category="health">I ordered 1 for my twin bed to try out.

  <Text category="health">This is a very good product. It helps

  <Text category="health">I've used this for quite some time now
  and really like it. I don't have the trouble with the toilet
  flushing that others seem to - but I suppose if you have one of
  those one-gallon regulated toilets, you'd probably have some
  trouble with this paper. It is thicker and tons softer, but it
  does a wonderful job too on things like runny noses, running
  cat's eyes, cleaning the bathroom sink, mirror, you name it. It's
  pretty strong stuff and I highly recommend it</Text>
  <Text category="health">I've been using Remington's Shaver Saver
  for 20 years. It keeps your shaver clean, lubricates well with
  not too much gooey oil, and works in an instant. I use a
  Remington MS2-100 Microscreen 2, and after a Shaver Saver
  treatment the shaver glides smoother over my face and shaves
  quicker and closer. A treatment seems to last for a while and I
  don't think it's necessary to use it every day. Usually 2 to 3
  times a week seems to be sufficient and your shaver will continue
  to perfrom like new</Text>
  <Text category="health">I bought this to go with my MS2-200BPT
  Shaver. I saw a review that said that it kept the shaver running
  well. I've been using it for about 1 month and I couldn't agree
  more. A quick spray on the cutters after shaving, and the next
  time I use it, it runs like new. I can tell the difference in the
  smoothness and speed of the shaver since I've started using it.
  As a bonus, it seems to last quite a while. Another strong
  product from Remington</Text>
  <Text category="health">I have several of these glasses now. Love

  <Text category="health">Nearly two years of ownership and it has

  Use to ensure legal driving or for ill advised contests. Also
  determine what at what BAC memory gets spotty (what point is

  suspect you are packing a lie detector of sorts. Also useful to
  get people off your back who think you are too drunk to drive.
  Pros precision to third decimal place. rare at this price at time
  of my purchase Very repeatable with consistant deep breath Small
  enough to take to bars in jacket pocket or cargo pockets. Light
  for its size. Cons Innaccurate if sips have been taken within 10
  minutes or so. True for all breathalyzers. Drunk idiots have
  tough time getting it through their heads Warm up/calibration

  <Text category="health">Optimum Nutrition's 100% whey protein is
  hands down the best I have tried, and I have tried a lot of
  different shake products in the past 10 years. I used to be
  committed to EAS and Labrada, but I found that the shakes are too
  hard for me to digest compared to ON Whey Protein. I mix it with
  water, and sometimes soy milk. It mixes easy, doesn't taste
  gritty, and is pure protein. It goes down very easy and I have no
  trouble digesting it, plus it builds muscle when combined with a
  solid workout plan. Plus, the price is reasonable.</Text>
  <Text category="health">I am a former General Nutrition Center
  employee and there are hundreds of "powdered" protein products
  that "hype" about the most important ingredient known for any
  person that works out. if you want a simple great tasting protein
  supplement that will help satisfy your daily intake without
  feeling sick, bloated or passing gas, then you need to trust in
  Optimum Nutritions 100% Whey Protein. It truly gives you the
  results you need as far as quality and nutrition goes. I strongly
  recommend 2% milk over water for even better taste, but water
  will still do the trick. If you buy Vanilla, i suggest mixing it
  with berries, bananas, strawberries, or bananas for added taste.
  this is by far the best protein supplement out there that is
  worth more for your money</Text>
  <Text category="health">I have been using this stuff regularly
  for about 10 months post workout &amp;amp; for meal replacement

  <Text category="health">This contains 16 servings, which means it
  will last you half a month. That's pretty expensive when you
  break the price down by serving and whne compared with a 1 month
  supply of the flax capsules that costs $7. However, liquid flax
  oil is a lot more concentrated than the pills you buy at the
  store. A flax oil pill typically contains 1000mg of flaxseed oil
  and a suggested dosage of 2-3 times a day. So with pills you're
  getting 2-3g of flax oil a day. With liquid flax oil, you're
  getting 14g of flax. If you are buying this for it's purported
  treatment of acne, sunburn, diverticular disorders, hemorrhoids,
  and more serious health conerns, it's probably best to consume
  the liquid flax oil. If you just want the benefits of lower
  cholesterol and heart disease prevention, a pill a few times a
  day, combined with fish oil should be all you need. It's
  definitely easier though to take a spoonful of this in the
  morning than 3 flax pills a day, and when you loook at value,
  you're getting 224g of flax oil in this bottle when compared with
  a typical 100g in a 100 pill bottle of the capsules. It all
  depends on what you need it for</Text>
  <Text category="health">Flax is a plant. The seeds in the flax
  plant are filled with flaxseed oil, (sometimes called linseed
  oil). The seeds contain fatty oils called alpha-linolenic acid
  (ALA) and linoleic acid. ALA is the omega-3 oil in flaxseed.
  Flaxseed contains both omega-3 fatty acids and omega-6 fatty
  acids. Flaxseed is nature's richest storehouse of omega-3 fatty
  acids, and contains more than twice as much omega-3 oil as fish
  oils, and it costs less , ounce for ounce. Flax also contains
  other important substances like lignans, which may protect
  against some types of cancer. The husks of the seeds are rich in
  mucilage. Both the seed oil and mucilage have many nutritional
  and therapeutic properties. There are many potential benefits
  from taking Flax seed oil: Flaxseed Oil lowers cholesterol
  levels, thereby improving cardiovascular health and lessening the
  risk of arteriosclerosis. Flaxseed also contains plant nutrients
  like phytoestrogens. These are natural estrogen-like substances
  that can lessen the discomfort of menopause. Flaxseed oil may
  lower high blood pressure. Flaxseed oil helps some people improve
  their psoriasis and eczema, as it has anti-inflammatory
  properties. Flaxseed may also reduce the itching, swelling, and
  redness associated with certain skin disorders such as acne.
  Flaxseed oil has a positive effect on rheumatoid arthritis due to
  its ability to calm inflammation. Flaxseed reduces LDL
  (low-density lipoprotein) cholesterol (the body's "bad
  cholesterol") and lowers triglyceride levels. Research shows that
  flaxseed oil gives much better protection against heart attacks
  than canola oil or olive oil. Taking flaxseed may reduce cancer
  risk. This is because flaxseed contains the richest sources of
  lignan building blocks, which play a major role in preventing
  cardiovascular diseases and cancer. New research indicates that
  the lignans in flaxseed have both short-term and long-term
  protective effects against colon cancer. Nature Made Flaxseed Oil
  is a quality source of flaxseed oil, as the company is well-known
  and reputable. One tip: keep your flaxseed oil away from light
  and heat, as both degrade the oil. The usual beneficial dose of
  Flaxseed Oil is 2-3 capsules once per day taken with a meal. The
  benefits of Flaxseed Oil are cumulative. Commit to taking it
  every day without fail. Like any herbal supplement, don't expect
  dramatic quick results. The results you get will be subtle at
  first and then build over time. For specific conditions such as
  Rhematoid arthritis, exzema, psoriasis, acne, etc,. the results
  should be apparent in 4-8 weeks. Be patient! Know that even if
  you don't "feel" different, you are sill protecting your body
  from the harmfull effects of many disease conditions. Jim

  <Text category="health">Back in the early 90s I was going through
  a bad acne period. I finally visited a dermatologist, and he put
  me on an Accutane regimen. I had sensitive skin and a tough
  beard, so regular shaving cream was too harsh (especially while
  taking Accutane - the solid brush-on cream I was using at the
  time burned the edges of my lips). He recommended that I shave
  with Cetaphil. Years later, my skin and beard are still
  troublesome. Therefore, I've kept Cetaphil as a part of my
  shaving regimen. Cetaphil goes on well and provides a nice
  lubrication for my shaver. It's not harsh or irritating, even on
  a freshly shaved face. However, it's kind of cold in the morning,
  which is a bit counter-productive after heating my face with hot
  water and shower steam to soften the whiskers. So I put the
  bottle on the tub floor while showering to heat it up with the
  runoff. By the time I'm done, it's warm enough for application
  after rubbing some around my hands for a second or two. However,
  even though Cetaphil feels good and lubricates well, its
  consistency is a bit thin to use alone. I like a good lather, so
  I combine Cetaphil with Kiss My Face Moisture Shave, which was
  recommended to me by a woman working at GNC. They mix well
  together, and I get a good, non-irritating shave by using the
  Gillette Fusion Power razor. For post-shave comfort and to
  prevent breakouts, I apply a product that contains salicylic
  acid, such as Clean&amp;amp;Clear Dual-Action Oil-Free
  moisturizing lotion. If you have a razor-challenging beard and
  skin combination like me, then make Cetaphil part of your shaving
  routine. Recommended</Text>

  <Text category="health">I'm a black male and everytime I would
  shave normally I would get irritated skin and ingrown hairs. At
  first i'd feel a little itch throughout the day and by the end of

  10-20 of them). That was before. Now after I apply the product I
  don't have the itch nor do the tiny bumps come up anymore. It
  just feels like I never had any hair on my face in the first

  slightly but I don't really care I mean it's not like the product

  <Text category="health">I installed this unit in my basement
  about 6 months ago, and it has been working flawlessly ever
  since. Things I noticed: If the power goes out, the unit will NOT
  turn back on automatically (as some other units do.) If you want
  to use the continuous drainage (which I highly recommend) via a
  hose, you have to punch out a plastic disc on the side of the
  unit. I would have designed a screw-type plug that was
  replacable, but they didn't think of that. Anyway, once you punch
  the quarter-size disc out it's out forever. If you choose to use
  the continuous drainage feature, you will need to pick up a hose
  with an inner diameter of 15mm (.59" or just over half an inch.)
  I went to the local DIY center and found some clear tubing that
  has worked well. The unit can operate down to 2-degrees C
  (36-degrees F), which will be great for continuous operation in
  the garage to keep the tools from rusting. Has three fan
  settings: med, high and quiet. "Quiet" really is quiet, and could
  probably work just fine in a bedroom. Though, it does warm the
  room it's in. How much it warms it depends on the humidity
  setting. Four settings: The humidty level (humidstat) can be set
  to "continuous dehumidification" (which is the default setting),
  50%, 60% and 70%. The fan will continue to run but the
  dehumidification processor will turn off when it reaches the
  selected humidity level. Cool. I mean, that's when the fan will
  just blow room-temp air. A full drainage tank will stop the unit
  and illuminate a "tank full" indicator light. The unit is not
  that heavy -- maybe for some, but not nearly as heavy as some
  people make it sound. It's 30.8 pounds. According to the
  instructions: You will need at least 21 cm (about 8 inches) of
  clearance in front, behind and side to side. Air blows out of the
  top of the unit, so you'll need to make sure it's clear as well.
  There are movable louvers on the top to direct the air straight
  up, 45-degrees or almost straight ahead. Power consumption:
  CFM-25E is 220W // CFM-40E is 330W I highly recommend this model

  <Text category="health">This was bought as a gift for my Dad, who
  has limited mobility. It's easy for him to use, easy to handle
  and gives him a great shave. He really likes it</Text>
  <Text category="health">I've used this razor for about 2 yrs. For
  me and my wife, it gives me a great close shave. I've never had a
  problem with skin irritation. Just how hard are these other guys
  pressing the razor on their face?! I can't imagine. I only need
  the lightest pressure to get a good shave. The shave is fast,
  about 2 mins. The dual blade design (each of the three heads has
  two rows of blades!) is awesome, makes the shave clean and fast.
  I'll probably stick with Remington rotories from now on, but will
  upgrade to a corded/cordless. My problems with it are: Can't use
  with cord if the battery dies (didn't know this when I bought it)
  The gears in the head strip/slip easily if a long beard/mustache
  hair gets in, which requires turning it off and back on again.
  Otherwise, it's a great solid razor</Text>

  that Mach3 power vibrating blade because, I don't know, a sharp
  blade the vibrates is asking for trouble in my opinion. Haha...
  He's very happy with it and likes the shave. And speaking about

  <Text category="health">I am a biochemist by education and was a
  teaching in physiology in a university. As such, I am very
  knowledgeable about chemistry and the human body in general. I
  really like Neutragena products and this product is certainly
  very high quality. For most people, I think it offers great
  protection, but not the best protection for people who need to be
  very conscious of sun exposure and the possibility of skin
  cancer. According to my dermatologist, recent studies have shown
  that SPF 15-30 wipes off after a few hours and doesn't offer
  adequate protection after that time. This is partly due to most
  people not using enough. In other words, they underestimate how
  much they need to apply to get that level of protection. For this
  reason, Neutrogena SPF 45 or 55 is better. Also, the Neutrogena
  Ultra Sheer products have been updated to include a technology
  called Helioplex. Most dermatologists that I know feel that this
  makes a difference in effectiveness and for some people this is
  going to be very important. I have used both this product and the
  higher SPF Helioplex formulations. In practice, I have found BOTH
  adequate for my needs. What I particularly like is that you don't
  even know you have the product on. It has virtually no scent and
  it really is so sheer you can't even notice it. Both of these
  products stay on a long time and are good for all day use, but my
  understanding is that the Helioplex formulation is even better.
  Further, it feels exactly the same on the skin. The only drawback
  is it's a bit more expensive. This is also a good product because
  it protects against both UVA and UVB rays. Both are implicated in
  skin cancer and it's important to protect yourself against both.
  If you are looking for an everyday sunscreen this might be the
  one. However, if you want the very best protection try the
  Neutrogena Helioplex SPF 55. This will give you the most peace of
  mind</Text>
  <Text category="health">My daughter and I have searched for a
  sunscreen that both of us would like, and never found one that
  was completely satisfactory. She has oily skin prone to
  breakouts, and mine is combination. Every one we tried always
  left a greasy feel and look to the face, even the ones that were
  supposed to be oil-free. Finally, I came across a review of this
  product on Paula Begoun's website (www.cosmeticscop.com). The
  review sounded good, so I went out and bought some right away. My
  daughter and I both LOVE this product! It's the only sunscreen we
  have ever used that doesn't leave a greasy feel or look to the
  skin. It dries to a matte finish, and works very, very well under
  foundation, too. Without foundation, there is no need to use
  powder to kill the shine. And it feels so light on the skin, you
  barely know it's there! If you have oily or combination skin and
  have never found a sunscreen that doesn't look and feel greasy,
  try this one! It's the best!</Text>
  <Text category="health">I cannot say how well this product really
  compares to other sunscreens in terms of sun protection. But it
  does have the right ingredients that most top-rated
  sunscreens/sunblocks use, so it should be at least on par with
  them. Where this product really shines (or DOESN'T shine) is for
  people with combination/oily skin. I have tried MANY sunscreens,
  and it's so hard to find a sunscreen WITHOUT moisturizers (if you
  have oily skin, that's already your natural moisturizers). I have
  even tried other NEUTROGENA sunscreens that are supposed to be
  OIL FREE and all that. The result on my face? After applying it,
  I always SHINE (which is NOT what I want). This magnificent
  product, however, actually gives my face a nice MATTE finish...
  and matte FEEL, too! It's a pretty thick cream when you first
  apply it (as opposed to other suncreens or other products that
  feel more like LOTION), but is almost immediately absorbed by the
  skin. In 30 seconds, there is no more greasy/creamy feeling, and
  in one minute, if you feel your skin, there's a nice matte feel.
  HOWEVER, and this is not the fault of the product, after about 3
  hours (at least for me), then I feel like the matte effect has
  worn off, and my oily skin is again showing its oily nature.
  Still, as far as suncreens go, this is the best I have tried for
  my skin, and I highly recommend it for people with
  combination/oily skin. BTW, this review is for the actual product
  I got, which is SPF 30. As of the time I am writing this review,
  here in amazon they also offer an SPF 45 version, and cheaper,
  too! I don't know the difference, but I always go for the LOWER
  one (in this case, SPF 30), because I theorize -- rightly or
  wrongly, I don't know -- that the lesser the SPF, the lesser the
  strength of the ingredients, so maybe it's better for sensitive
  skin (?)</Text>

  <Text category="health">Shavers fall into two categories, those
  who prefer rotaries like the Norelco and those who prefer foil
  shavers. For those of you who like foil shavers, this is the one
  for you! I've owned the latest Braun 8985 and it was excellent,
  while it lasted... The charger kept breaking on me (once in the
  first month [11/2006], then another time 4 months later
  [3/2007]). It was expensive, and the refills were a pain, pricey,
  but they worked. After two exchanges I decided to try the norelco
  8140XL (speed XL)rotaries, and while they shaved really close,
  they tore up my neck. The problem only got worse. Returned 3
  weeks later. I just got the Panasonic and can say that it
  definitely shaves closer than both of the tried razors. They
  shave MUCH faster than the Braun and Norelcos. I'm not sure if I
  like the "side to side" pivoting head, only time will tell. The
  heads don't pivot up and down as much as the Braun, but once
  again, time will tell if this is necessary. One MAJOR advantage
  is that it cleans with soap and water... No expensive refills to
  hassle over. The panasonic has two noticeable downsides: 1. It's
  louder than other shavers, but who cares? It shaves incredibly
  fast anyway. 2. You can't plug it in and shave... You have to
  wait until the battery is charged and charger is disconnected to
  turn it on. This is my favorite razor by far.</Text>
  <Text category="health">I have to say that I have been converted.
  For over 15 years now I lived with a razor. I have a pretty thick
  beard and it grows fast too. I am the kind of guy that gets a 5
  o'clock shadow at noon. I have used every single type of razor
  out there from disposable to the battery operated vibrating type
  and from the one blade to the 5+1 blade. I have tried all the
  brands and ended up feeling the Gillette brand is the best type
  of razor, but now I find it's not the best shave. I used an
  electric shaver several years back, it was one of the top of the
  line Norelco with the incorporated gel. It gave me a pretty bad
  razor burn and did not get all the hairs; I ended up having to
  shave as normal. --TRUE STORY-- I am a Manager at my job and on
  my last annual review the only item I was marked bad was my
  personal appearance. Not that I dress bad or not wear deodorant,
  but that they felt I didn't shave often. (I shave at the very
  least every other day, usually every day). So I felt I had to so
  something about it. I researched electric shavers thinking I
  could get a quick shave during my lunch hour in my car or at
  least on my way to work so it would last longer. I found that
  Panasonic seems to be leading the pack and was moderately priced
  and had all the features the expensive models had. The
  instruction manual is explicit in saying it will take about 30
  days to get used to any new shaving method and they assure you
  will love the Panasonic shaver once your facial hairs get used to
  the way it is cut. I have been using it for almost 30 days now,
  and I will not live without it. I have NEVER had this close of a
  shave before. I can actually go 2 days without getting a shadow.
  My fianc&#239;&#191;&#189; has found a new love for touching my
  face, and I seem to be getting more kisses too! During the first
  2 weeks I had to get a couple of the missed hairs with my old
  Gillette, but today officially I was able to through my Gillette
  away for good. (My boss has even asked what I am doing different
  and when I told him, he went out and bought one too, he also
  loves it now. My fianc&#239;&#191;&#189; said she would leave me
  if I stopped using the Panasonic, it's a good thing Panasonic has
  been around for decades) So, I am raving about his product, but
  every good has its bad... what the bad? Well, it gets a couple of
  weeks to get used to the shave, but for the amount of time I am
  planning to use it and the money I am saving from buying razors
  every month, I can handle that. The cleaning system is very good,
  but it takes very long to clean (2-3 hrs) and it is noisy since
  the base turns the shaver on and off during the cleaning cycles.
  The cleaning cartage is said to last 3 months whether you use it
  once a day or one a week. I have not gotten to that point yet,
  but it is very very easy to clean in the shower with some body
  wash. I just end up using the base for the drying cycle, which is
  an option. The batter is very good. In the month I have used it,
  I have charged it twice but it really didn't need it as it said
  the charge was good. Overall... excellent product. Could there be
  a better shaver out there, maybe, will I ever know... at this
  time, I am not worried about it, I am very satisfied with this
  Panasonic, and don't think it can get any better. This product
  does not include the cleaning base. I do recommend it as even if
  you don't use it to clean the razor, you can use it to dry it, it
  will help keep your blades in the newest condition and prevent
  them from rusting when air drying. But, if you are looking to
  save money and get an excellent razor, this is it!</Text>
  <Text category="health">Panasonic makes a great electric shaver,
  this is the second one for me in the last sixteen years</Text>
  <Text category="health">I am a woman of color and this product
  eliminates any discoloration without irritation or disturbing my
  combination skin. I highly recommend this product for women who
  need to brighten their appearance once a week. After 5 years I
  continue to use this and the pumpkin exfoliating mask. The papaya
  is good as well</Text>
  <Text category="health">This is the 2nd year that I have used the
  Neutrogena Ultra Sheer Dry-Touch Sunblock, SPF 45. I have Normal
  to Oily, sensitive, acne-prone skin. I am fair and can burn
  easily. I think this product is well worth the money, it is
  quickly absorbed into the skin and has a dry feel. It does not
  make your skin look greasy and has never caused me to break out.
  I apply it in the morning and it pretty much lasts me a good 8
  hours. The time will vary depending on your sun tolerance,
  though. It is also conveniently sized to toss in your bag and
  lasts quite awhile</Text>
  <Text category="health">My kids really liked how it didn't feel
  like suntan lotion</Text>
  <Text category="health">I was very happy with the prpduct and the
  shipping was very quick, even in the middle of the holidays. I
  will probably order another 3 inch memory foam from allsleep for
  my queen size bed</Text>
  <Text category="health">I got this bed topper a couple weeks ago
  to place on my older matress. It was pretty pungent, but it felt
  so good the first time I layed in it. after a couple days it
  appeared to lose it's memory and start to dent and crease, but
  eventually it got back to full expansion. The customer service
  with this item was fantastic! We'll see how long the matress
  keeps up its memory</Text>
  <Text category="health">When I get a sinus infection, it stays
  and builds much congestion. Rx and over-the-counter has limited
  value. One event that led to my first (I am 69) severe asthma
  event, which messed up my immune system and led to my first
  angina events which the brought open heart surgury. NeilMed
  pre-mixed packets sound like the "minor leagues" compared to the
  above. When a thorough cleansing is needed to make the sinus
  areas hostile to infection, these little packets take the mess
  out of measuring your own salt and soda(i.e. to make a mistake is
  painful even with the right salt). Then there is a $15 price in
  local stores for 100 packets, or about the same on-line for 200.
  Also a quick response from the vendor.</Text>
  <Text category="health">This Sinus Rinse works great and it's
  easy to use. Great price from Amazon and quick shipping</Text>
  <Text category="health">Bought 2 of these 3 years ago on QVC for
  my husband and myself. I was pregnant with my second son and
  going to get waxed at the nail shop, where it smelled like nail
  polish remover, was just too much for me at the time. We love
  these shavers and they work just as well today as they did 3
  years ago! I'm not sure what the other reviewer is talking about,
  I get an incredibly close shave with this. To be honest, and
  maybe a little too personal, I haven't waxed my upper lip since,
  I only use this! There is NO stubble, NO pain and great results!
  I have dark hair, and if this in anyway made me look like I
  shaved, I would never use it! I am buying 2 more for back up. I
  hope they never stop making these!!</Text>
  <Text category="health">So far this dryer is working great!
  Another brand didn't last 1 year so I hope this one lasts
  longer</Text>
  <Text category="health">I've tried a lot of different "nutrition"
  and "energy" bars, and these are my favorites (along with a
  couple of other chocolate ZonePerfect bars like Double Chocolate
  and Chocolate Raspberry). Great taste, a nice texture (sort of
  like Nestle Crunch), and much more satisfying than candy bars.
  Almost as tasty as Girl Scout "Thin Mints", but not as fat- and
  guilt-inducing</Text>
  <Text category="health">I have tried a gazillion of these "diet"
  protein bars. This is the only one I've actually found so far
  that tastes good.</Text>
  <Text category="health">My 16-year-old daughter used this on
  problem acne on her back and shoulders with noticeable results by
  the second day - existing blemishes healed, no new break-out.
  She's excited. No harsh benzoyl peroxide (active ingredient is
  salicylic acid). The Body Scrub has the little exfoliating
  "beads" in it (not mentioned on the bottle) - so it makes skin
  feel smooth immediately. And the fragrance is very light, clean
  (gender-neutral). Also, it's very concentrated, so it goes a long
  way - making it easily worth the money as far as any body wash
  goes (and Amazon's price is better than the in-store price). Of
  course, everyone is different when it comes to acne treatments -
  but it worked here.</Text>
  <Text category="health">good product. does what it says. however,
  it could smell better. it has almost no scent. you smell
  clean...but it has almost no scent. other than that it feels
  great, lathers great, leaves your skin feeling nice. and it
  clears your skin up</Text>
  <Text category="health">This give an excellent finish to a shave.
  I strongly suggest using the shaving oil as well. Apply hot water
  to dilate your pores, then apply the oil, then shaving cream,
  shave, and finally the after shave balm. The oil and balm make
  for an amazing shaving experience. Your face feels incredibly
  smooth afterward. I don't use it every day because it is a little
  more time consuming that just applying the shaving cream alone,
  but I do use the products above most of the time because of the
  great feel after</Text>
  <Text category="health">I knew a man who once wore this classic
  cologne, and always smelled so good. I bought it for my hubby
  this Christmas and instantly remembered why I loved that smell so
  much. It is a classic frangrance, not stinky or overpowering -
  but fresh. There are other Vetiver cologne's out there, but they
  smell NOTHING like the Guerlain from France. It's a gorgeous
  smell, and I guarantee you would love it if you are looking to
  smell great without it being overpowering. It's smooth and
  mellow, fresh</Text>
  <Text category="health">This is a good massager that can hone in

  <Text category="health">I say the scale is pretty good and

  Accurate. For the Price I would rather get something
  cheaper</Text>

  <Text category="health">The Neutrogena Norwegian Formula Foot
  Creme was a dream for this mother. My 7-year-old was unfortunate
  enough to inherit a severe callous problem that affects his hands
  and feet. The problem is so severe in his father that his
  father's hands and feet are literally split open and very
  painful. The 7-year-old has already started with very hard
  calluses and nothing seems to relieve them. Nothing, that is,
  until now. Just a small nightly dose seems to be helping
  immensely into giving my dear son back the soft feet I would
  expect a 7-year-old to have. I highly recommend this product to
  anyone who suffers from dry, cracked feet</Text>
  <Text category="health">You couldn't have picked a better person
  to Test Drive this product. I have severely dried and callused
  heals. From the moment I put the creme on my feet, they felt
  smoother. The creme stays on for hours like the product says. I
  can't believe the difference it's made in such a short time. I'll
  definitely buy this product, and I'll be recommending it to my
  mom, whose feet are drier than mine are</Text>
  <Text category="health">This is the best investment ever! They
  start you out with everything you need from the liners to the
  paraffin. It was so easy to set up &amp;amp; start enjoying. I've
  used it on average twice a week and my feet &amp;amp; hands are
  so wonderfully moist--even in this winter weather. My heels are
  no longer cracked &amp;amp; my cuticles are so healthy--not
  snagging at all. Thank you for this perfect product &amp;amp; so
  much cheaper than going to the salon! It's so relaxing (I use
  lavender) as I do this just before bed</Text>
  <Text category="health">I have been having severe back pain
  (muscular)and subsequent headaches on a daily basis for many
  months. I finally brokedown and went to see one of my colleagues
  who is a physiatrist. He recommended the theracane to me. He is a
  physician who is both a DC, (Doctor of Chiropractic) and a
  physician, DO. This physician has been doing trigger point
  therapy including intramuscular needling to help release the
  painful knots in my back. I find that I can use the theracane in
  between visits with noted relief. This same doctor states that
  this condition is like diabetes and needs to be managed for life
  and thus, the theracane allows for me to maintain. I think the
  theracane is an ingenious invention. I don't really have anything
  negative to say, with the exception of the pain I am trying to
  manage. The product arrived quickly after I ordered it and it is
  exactly as described.</Text>
  <Text category="health">The Theracane is a fantastic tool for
  unknotting hard-to-reach muscles. It looks clunky, but the shape
  is right for providing leverage (and therefore more pressure) to
  just the right spots. A great companion for the Theracane is "The
  Trigger Point Therapy Workbook, 2nd edition" by Clair Davies. It
  matches sore places on the human body with the trigger points
  (the muscle knots) that cause them. I solved a persistent
  recurring pain in my upper back by massaging a trigger point near
  my throat. The Unwind company is an A+ operation. Ordering is
  easy, customer service is friendly, their prices are among the
  lowest, and shipping is super-speedy (my order shipped within two
  hours). I ordered directly from their website and received free
  shipping.</Text>
  <Text category="health">I didn't think I would like the
  fragrance, but it's absolutely wonderful. It's not too sweet or
  strong. It smells good on my daughters and me. Give it a try. You
  won't be disappointed</Text>
  <Text category="health">We all have from time to time brought
  those heavy bottle of liquid detergent to the washing machine,
  and breaking our backs in the process. Thankfully, All Small
  &amp;amp; Mighty might be a unique solution. It is a concentrated
  detergent that works with the capacity of a traditional 100 ounce
  bottle. I like it because it really does a great job at cleaning
  clothes that haven't been completely spotless from all those
  tough messes from other methods. I really think that everyone
  should own this product because it saves a lot of headaches,
  while being true to its price. That's All! Price: B+ Convience:

  <Text category="health">Very convenient reading glasses. You
  could hang them on your neck when not using them, and not even
  notice they are there. They are very sturdy, and are flexible
  making them almost imposible to break. Cons: Both sets I
  purchased I notice them to be on the narrow side. They sometimes
  can feel too tight to the side of your face. The glasses are also
  not practicable to wear for a person with long hair, as the
  glasses would trap your hair against your face</Text>
  <Text category="health">This is the longest period of time that
  my husband has kept a pair of reading glasses. The Click readers
  loop around his neck and are always there when he needs them. He
  gets lots of comments about how neat they are</Text>
  <Text category="health">I purchased this unit for my personal
  office at work. Its small and unobtrusive enough so as not to
  necessarily stand out. Its runs quietly and well, operating on
  the highest setting for several hours</Text>
  <Text category="health">After 3 months use, I'm buying two more
  of these for my daughters. The unit is compact, very sturdy,
  virtually silent, and puts out plenty of mist even on the low
  setting. The small tank is light and easy to fill, even in a
  bathroom sink (many people really have to wrestle with those one
  gallon tanks) yet it easilly lasts through an 8 hour work day or
  nights sleep. The key feature is that it is small and quiet. That
  means it can be near you on a desk top or night table. Having the
  mist nearer to you and less in the ambient air means less will
  condense on cold windows (and cause mildew). It also means you
  can use the low setting which makes the small tank last longer
  and reduces any risk of vapor droplets settling to the table top.
  If you want to use the high setting, put the unit on top of a
  book shelf, dresser or file cabnit to allow a longer path for the
  mist to settle. This is small and light enough to take on the
  road to dry hotel rooms. One daughter wants one for her dorm
  room, which is overheated. The unit is easily moved from bedroom
  to den or wherever you locate during the day. You would not find
  this convenient with large (gallon) humidifiers. This unit is
  also inexpensive, at around $30 which is half the cost of many
  larger models (so you can get two). After using several
  evaporative humidifiers, I love not spending $6 - $9 a month for
  paper replacement wicks. Overall, I am delighted with the unit.
  The only criticsm is the blue LED is too bright in a dark room.
  This is easily dimmed by putting a piece of masking or adhesive
  tape over it. The light is helpful to avoid bumping the unit if
  you reach for the phone or a tissue in the dark of night. It also
  lights up the mist so you know there is still water in the
  chamber. Highly recommended.</Text>
  <Text category="health">I have a severe dry eye problem and i
  found in internet that a humidifier may help. I bought big one
  for home and personal for work. It's been 2 days and it's working
  fine</Text>
  <Text category="health">These wipes are awesome! They got here
  real fast too!</Text>
  <Text category="health">It arrived in 3 days and I used it for a
  week, and I still get some stray ingrowns once in a while but it
  is the only thing that worked this good this fast for me and
  trust me I tried everything in the book. A plus is my face is one
  even complexion when I had alot of dark spots which was a
  pleasant surprise</Text>
  <Text category="health">You know right away your teeth feel
  different, much like how they feel after a dentist cleaning. The
  dual action (larger) head is gentler and feels more like a normal
  toothbrush but it certainly isn't as aggressive as the smaller
  one in it's ability to clean. If you can handle the smaller heads
  they certainly do a better job. The flossing attachment was also
  very effective</Text>
  <Text category="health">After brushing with the HydraBrush, my
  teeth feel as clean as when I've been to the dental hygenist.
  This is a great product. I am so glad that replacement brushes
  are available at Amazon</Text>
  <Text category="health">Hydrabrush is an excellent power
  toothbrush because the brushHead has more surfaces to get at your
  teeth and gum line making the brushing very comfortable and
  refreshing afterwards. I use the soft brushHead because I used to
  have gingivitis and my gums were red and swollen, but since using
  the Hydrabrush and the 8 brushes (4 on each side) I don't have to
  worry about missing when I brush my teeth. Excellent
  product.</Text>
  <Text category="health">I used this to get marks off my washer
  and dryer and then went on to clean the rest of the house! This
  little "sponge" is awesome, and it is just like a sponge; it's
  not abrasive. The only problem I see with it (and all cleaning
  products) is that you actually have to use it for it to work;
  lol</Text>
  <Text category="health">For anyone on the fence about these, jump
  over to my side ;) My (then) 2 year old had gotten a hold of my
  husband's permanent black marker. We just bought a brand new
  refrigerator. I turned my back for a few moments, and when I
  looked back, she had scribbled *all over* my new fridge. I tried
  bleach, soap, scrubby sponges... nothing worked. My first new
  appliance was ruined! On a whim I bought this. (Couldn't hurt,
  right?) It got it off immediately! (I had to press a little bit
  to get it out of the grooves.) I was so excited, I started
  running around my house trying to find things to scrub... I know
  that it removes shoe scuffs with ease, markers or crayons from
  walls, and a multitude of other "sins" your children may commit
  against your home.</Text>
  <Text category="health">This product works great for water
  retention. I like that it doesn't keep you running to the ladies
  room, works great</Text>
  <Text category="music">This is a wonderful album, that evokes
  memories of the 60's folk boom, yet contains original songs. I
  was amazed at the fantastic harmonies and musical arrangements.
  Anyone who loves the movie "A Mighty Wind" and who loves folk
  music will fall in love with this album. I know I did</Text>
  <Text category="music">On one hand, this CD is a straight ahead
  instrumental rocker, but Johnny A really shows how great he is
  with ballads, such as his covers of "Wichita Lineman," and "Yes
  it Is." In fact, those two ballads alone are worth the price of
  the CD by themselves. But Johnny A can flat kick your ass, too.
  He's a biker and his tunes like Oh Yeah, In the Wind and Two
  Wheel Horse are named for his other hobby. And they rock, but
  there's nothing cliched or tired in his style. He always seems to
  be looking for new ways to say something. I saw him in person at
  the Triple Door in Seattle sometime in February 2005 in a power
  trio format and he played most of the tunes on this album. The
  guy is one amazing guitar player. He played his signature Gibson
  hollow body, fitted with a vibrato tailpiece (Bigsby? It was like
  the old Chet Atkins "country gentleman" model) and he utilized a
  battery of foot pedal effects, coming eventually through a pair
  of Marshall combo amps. The guy had some of the best clean tones
  I've ever heard from anyone, anywhere. Basically, Johnny A is a
  guitarist who has complete command of the instrument. And he's
  got a rocking soul that cuts loose on originals and covers alike
  in a style that's all his own, and that's saying something these
  days. If you love great rocking/rockabilly guitar, combined with
  really cool ballad playing in the power trio format, this CD is
  just what you're looking for. In fact, I guarantee you'll be
  knocked out. Five stars.</Text>
  <Text category="music">this band reminds me of the thrill i first
  got when i listened to an Atreyu Album. It dies today rip off the
  former bands style, but they are still a very good band. In the
  over-crowded metalcore market of today, that is a rarity. My only
  complaint, is that the vocalist has a beautiful singing voice (as
  heard on "The Radiance), but more often then not goes for the
  screams and growls that are associated with this type of music.
  still 5/5 material though. Favorite songs: "The Radiance," "Freak
  Gasoline Fight," "Our Disintigration," and :THe Caitliff
  Choir:Defeatism</Text>
  <Text category="music">Like I said I would, I finally got around
  to purchasing this CD. I especially like tracks 9-12. Cheap Trick
  is solid as always. I have been a long time fan and enjoy all
  their releases. If I do have any criticism at all, it is the fact
  that some songs sound like recycled Trick riffs. I guess it's
  hard to create new stuff after 30+ years. Anyway, there are some
  great tunes on this. Buy it like I did!</Text>
  <Text category="music">Ok good CD. im not suprised. Ok jaheim may
  not have the b best voice but his music is good and it goes will
  with the voice that he has. Yes yall this album does use
  profanity but the songs actually have meanings. I like that daddy
  thing song, and like a dj. This album looks at issues from a mans
  point of view. Ya know we've heard the angry woman and how the
  man did t his and that now jaheim looks at it from a males view.
  Ok yall i know he is not the first one to do this but he did it
  well. Also this is a break from that [...] that is played on the
  radio.</Text>
  <Text category="music">Review by Mike Watson: With the recent
  slew of Victory Records releases, not to mention the wide
  variety; one can be to say the least skeptical of any of their
  assortment of new releases. However, picking through all of the
  less notable releases from the label, the up-and-coming band, The
  Forecast, have stepped to the plate and scored a home run on Late
  Night Conversations. The Forecast are a perfect blend of male and
  female vocals over a very modern rock soundtrack, executed
  flawlessly over a ten song full length. Late Night Conversations
  is an album confronting different topics ranging from
  relationships to the teen trend of mutilation and loathing. The
  harmonies arranged by both vocalists are undeniably catching and
  well written and the music follows closely in suit leaving your
  head bobbing back and forth to the beat and your feet tapping
  almost involuntarily. The Forecast is not only a great recorded
  band, but bring the same toe tapping energy to the stage, with
  both great stage presence and cohesion as a band. The Forecast
  will defiantly be one of the new big bands in poppier rock music,
  and checking their Victory Records debut out is a must for fans
  of the genre.</Text>
  <Text category="music">great anniversary present. fav song... I
  love the way you love me... my husband loves to listen to it in
  the car</Text>
  <Text category="music">As we all know by now, Lil' Jon is not
  known for his lyrical capabilities, but for his platinum
  productions and ability to find guest artists perfect for his
  songs. He is truly the king of crunk. Many of the songs on the
  album are much like the hit single, "Get Low" feat. The Ying Yang
  Twins- strong pumping dacefloor beats, lots of swearing and
  yelling constantly Yeeah!, Whuut?, and Okaay! Buying the edited
  version (if there is one) would be a total waste. This album is
  not for the meek or faint hearted! Much of the songs hardly have
  many words from Lil Jon himself, mostly from the featured
  artists. These include Petey Pablo, 8Ball and MJG, Chyna Whyte,
  Pastor Troy, Jadakiss, Styles P., ect. My faveorites 1) Throw it
  up w/ Pastor Troy- a 'hood representing song with a thumping beat
  2) Get Low 3) Rep Yo City w/ Petey Pablo, Bun B- a very good song
  with talents all around 4) Knockin' Heads Off- again Jon struts
  his stuff 5) I Don't Give A...- perfect for before game pumping
  musi</Text>
  <Text category="music">Relationships and drug use are major
  themes. This album starts off with two absolute killer tunes,
  lets down some but has a joy thoughout. I can't believe this is
  going to be his only album.....what a shame. From someone who has
  been listening to rock for a long time, I tell ya, this is a
  blast. Pure fun. Something you might want to give to someone you
  have broken up with as its full of a broken heart and the joy of
  being in love.....mostly rather quickly paced. One of my favorite
  albums of the 90s. More people should listen</Text>
  <Text category="music">I didn't think it was possible for the
  Delays to top their debut release - but they have. While "Faded
  Seaside Glamour" is more immediately catchy and refined, "You See
  Colours" comes at you in a much more intense manner. The songs
  are more mature, the musicianship is top-notch and the recording
  sparkles with fat bottom-end and soaring harmonies. The high
  points for me are Valentine and Winters Memory Of Summer, but
  there's honestly not a bad track on this release. The Delays put
  it all together - great songwriting, strong musicianship and
  excellent production in a genre-bending mix that has something
  for everybody. It's a shame these guys don't get more recognition
  here in the States. Buy it</Text>
  <Text category="music">Just lay back and listen. Brian Wilson
  never misses a note. His voice was one of the natural wonders of
  sixties pop. His composing and arranging skills are without peer
  and he even plays some awesome bass (the slow middle eight
  section on &amp;amp;quot;Wouldn't It Be Nice&amp;amp;quot;)on
  this album. These songs are the sound of former teen idols
  settling into adulthood and feeling both excited and uncertain.
  Recorded with a large selection of musicians and sung
  heartbreakingly well by the Beach Boys themselves, this is a true
  pop magnum opus. The best tracks are the gorgeous
  &amp;amp;quot;You Still Believe In Me&amp;amp;quot;,
  &amp;amp;quot;Don't Talk (Put Your Head On My
  Shoulder&amp;amp;quot;), the title cut, and the tear inducing
  &amp;amp;quot;Caroline No&amp;amp;quot;. Instead of trapping you
  outside his pain and insecurity, Brian Wilson invites you into
  his world and lays his soul bare with a suite of songs that
  haven't aged a day since 1966. The more you listen to
  &amp;amp;quot;Pet Sounds&amp;amp;quot;, the more it's beauty
  envelopes you</Text>
  <Text category="music">If you like vocalese, then this cd is for
  you. The song selection and performances are excellent. In my
  opinion, it stands up with the best Lambert, Hendricks, and Ross
  stuff. It is clear that a lot of love and effort went into the
  making of this record. Buy and enjoy</Text>
  <Text category="music">I can honestly say that when I first heard
  Scarling's "So Long, Scarecrow", I was less than impressed. I've
  been into Scarling for a few years now, and when I heard their
  first record,"Sweet Heart Dealer", I instantly fell in love. I
  somewhat held it above everything else, I was so impressed by it.
  So when I heard the progression from SHD to SLS, I was a little
  bit let down. But after three solid listens, from first to last,
  I was totally amazed by this record. It was like something
  clicked and I was able to see the beauty each track held. I
  seriously listen to this CD almost everyday. Although I prefer
  some tracks to others [(Northbound on) Cauhenga!], I really can't
  think of one track that I just don't like. It now takes place in
  my favorites over SHD. I feel that this record can really appeal
  to anyone; it's very versatile. And, as always, Jessicka's
  beautiful vocals compliment the indescribable amazingness of the
  music wonderfully. If you're indecisive about purchasing this
  record, I say bite the bullet, give it a few solid listens, and
  promptly be blown away</Text>
  <Text category="music">This is a wonderful, fun and soothing CD!
  It will relax children and parents will enjoy it even after the
  100th listen!! My husband is a musician and he loves both of the
  Dan Zanes CDs we have. This will now be a gift I give to all my
  friends and family when they have a baby</Text>
  <Text category="music">There is a saying in the construction
  industry "Tripping over dollars to pick up nickels." Or in the
  regular world "Can't see the Black Forest for the trees." I doubt
  if there IS an definitive rendition of all of Beethoven's
  symphonies. Even the composers own conducted versions changed
  over time and from performance to performance depending on the
  players or his intentions. Instruments were constantly changing
  and you know this guy was never satisfied, always stretching. We
  can only guess what his EXACT intentions would be today or
  tomorrow. What you want to remember is: 1) The first version of
  anything you seriously like will color your listenings of
  subsequent versions. You'll be listening for qualities that
  aren't there and missing qualities that are there. 2) Different
  versions bring us different views. Isn't that a good thing? Sound
  in all it's forms is preferable than a useless search for the
  best sound. I'd rather have that kind of an attitude than the
  bickering negative perfectionist snob attitudes of some of the
  reviewers here. Having said that... I love these versions. I've
  had them for some time. I have at least 4 versions of the
  symphonies. These are clear, well recorded, dynamic and straight
  forward. Beethoven's passion, mental range and personal warmth
  are within. You can easily hear the information that Beethoven
  wanted you to hear. Probably better than he could. No make that
  clearly better than he could. Ha ha! These are solid, lovely,
  beautiful, and astounding. Listen to them</Text>
  <Text category="music">This album sparked the so-called
  "Neo-Soul" movement years before it was adopted by other artists.
  Back in early 1986 everything was about synthesizer overkill and
  Prince broke the music back down to its roots. This concept was

  <Text category="music">This has to be one of the most beautiful
  CDs ever recorded. Damien's vocal range is vast; his musicianship
  excellent; but it's the crafting of songs at which he truly
  surpasses most artists. Haunting, sensitive, flowing, crashing...
  (If I have one criticism, it's the mixing levels - at times, his
  vocals are drowned. In concert, when he lets rip, you really feel
  the power of his vocals/music, which, unfortunately, doesn't come
  over quite as well on the album.) A truly magical album.</Text>
  <Text category="music">A friend loaned me her CD and I absolutely
  loved it......but I could not purchase it ANYWHERE.....my
  daughter suggested I contact you.....results, results!!!! Thank
  you! A most outstanding seasonal soft listening CD</Text>
  <Text category="music">I had tears in my eyes when I first heard
  this album. I get emotional over music I really like, and this
  album got to me.So many great standards so well delivered by the
  duo. They deliberately chose slower ballads for this album so
  don't look for uptempo,snappy songs in this one.Not that Harry
  Warren could not write faster stuff like Jeepers
  Creepers,Shuffling Off to Buffalo etc. This album is to sing
  along with softly or hum.I kept thinking of Bogart in the rain in
  Casablanca and other lovers in W.WII.I know the main tune in that
  movie was not by Harry Warren;it simply reminded me of great love
  tunes from that era by Julie Styne[Time After Time] and the
  grossly underrated Harry Warren.Grab someone you love, some good
  wine and savor one of the great popular composers and a great
  duo.They should do more Harry Warren albums,Michael and George.I
  thank them profusely</Text>
  <Text category="music">Poison the Well are one of those bands
  that I was really big on right when I first started listening to
  them, but which faded a lot pretty quickly. I can't really say
  why. I like their work, but it doesn't inspire me the way it used
  to. Still, I do like them, and this album particularly. Maybe not
  as much as Opposite of December, but whatever. Yes, this isn't as
  'hardcore' as their older stuff, but I've never been hardcore
  kiddie. (I'm a metalhead) And frankly, being a modern hardcore
  band ain't much of a compliment in my book. It's funny, lotsa
  tech-metalcore and other 'core derived bands are good, but most
  straight hardcore/metalcore is staggeringly boring. So, while old
  PTW was semi-technical metalcore, this album is pretty much just
  extremely loud emo. But, they now how to be 'emotional' and not
  come across as sissies,(well, most of the time) and Jeff doesn't
  sing in an unbearably affected manner. Course, the 'extremely
  loud' part helps a lot too, and Jeff's growls/screams are
  absolutely devastating. Way better than on their previous albums,
  and some of the best extreme vox from anyone, ever. As an
  extremely heavy emo album, the instrumentation here is pretty
  bland. There isn't much real riffing going on, not in the metal
  sense anyway, mostly just a single note/chord repeated a great
  many times, than another one etc. But, the vox and atmospherics
  carry the day. The standout track is 'Crystal Lake', an
  absolutely bestial piece of deathcore. I've listened to quite a
  bit of death metal in my day, but this has got to be one of the
  most devastating tracks I've ever heard, largely because of the
  absolutely impassioned vox. Lotsa extreme vox lack emotion, but
  never Moeria's (probably spelling that wrong, sorry) That, and
  the instruments are more noteworthy, very nasty and chaotic.
  Also, it earns points for taking some of the seriousness out the
  genre with its jokey lyrics. (For the culturally backward, this
  song is a first-person narrative from Jason Voorhees, killer of
  most of the 'Friday the 13th' films. Hence the name 'Crystal
  Lake'.) There are no truly weak tracks here. 'Ghostchant' is a
  good opener, nicely displaying the extreme tonal dichotomy of the
  album, mixing the fierce screams with some nice melodic vox.
  'Loved Ones' is one of the very best tracks, again carried almost
  entirely by the powerful vox. Tracks 5 is a cool two part thing
  mixing the rather pleasant, harmonica and bass driven intro with
  one of the more hectic, grinding main songs. The album takes a
  turn for the lighter at about track 8. 'Apathy is a Cold Body' is
  a very emo-y track, but it's got a lot of nice melody to it, so
  it works. 'Sound like the End of the World' is another strange
  one. It's a slow doomy piece with oppressive atmosphere and a
  thick layering of vocal lines. Not the best thing here, but it
  works and it earns some points for being different. Yes, a solid,
  if not great album. Check it out</Text>

  <Text category="music">Wonderful instrumentals and lyrics. A
  Shenandoah Lullaby is simply beautiful. I love the way the ending
  segues into Brahm's lullaby. His version of Arkansas traveller is
  refreshing. Teddy Bears' Picnic is a quaint song that few people

  and giggles from time to time. I like all the songs on the CD. A
  breath of fresh air for parents who prefer real instruments to
  synthesized pop.</Text>
  <Text category="music">I rarely write reviews of music but feel
  that I must share my impressions of this CD. I have long heard
  some of my favorite singers praise the songwriting prowess of
  Townes but somehow never got around to buying one of his records.
  I finally picked this one up because it had two songs that were
  covered by two of my favorite singers--Lyle Lovett-"Lungs" (among
  others) and Steve Earle-"Tecumseh Valley". I was blown away by
  the sheer beauty and poetry of every song on this recording.
  Other reviewers seem to be comparing this to other Townes'
  records. I come from a different angle. As someone who has long
  heard Townes sopken of with the highest praise, I can say this
  disk does not disappoint and will influence me to fill out my
  collection of his recordings. I will also say that I am deeply
  frustrated that I never took advantage of the chance to see
  Townes perform while he was alive.</Text>
  <Text category="music">Without a doubt, the highlight is the DVD
  of the 1975 show in London. "Born to Run," the album, had put him
  on the cover of "Time" and "Newsweek" the same week in October,
  1975, one of the very few times that has happened for a non-news
  story. The publicity and hype generated by Columbia records was
  so overwhelming that there was a backlash: "Nobody can be that
  good." So here we see his first show ever in the UK, playing to
  an audience of professional critics and amateur skeptics, people
  thinking, "hey, 'Rock and Roll Future,' this is the land of the
  Beatles, the Rolling Stones, The Who - who do you think you're
  kidding. No unknown kid from America deserves 'Time' and
  'Newsweek.'" The show begins in almost total darkness, a piano
  softly plays, then harmonica, and a soft spotlight lights the kid
  from New Jersey who sings "Thunder Road," accompanied by only
  piano. An unknown song at the time, "Thunder Road" has become a
  Springsteen classic. IMHO, especially given the expectations, it
  is a perfect understated opening. The DVD has the entire show,
  including everything from the hard rock of "She's the One," and
  "Born to Run," the song, to a much slowed down version of "For
  You," an underated sleeper on his first album, "Greeting From
  Asbuty park, NJ." Bruce accompanies himself on the piano and I
  swear, this version of "For You" is so beautiful it could be the
  scruffy New Jersey kid channeling god. Any skeptic who walked out
  of this show thinking Springsteen was merely hype has no ears, no
  taste, or was xenophobic. The show gives more than a big hint
  that this Springsteen guy is for real, as a songwriter and
  performer, and that "Born to Run," especially, is an extraodinary
  album. There are only eight songs, but none are fill. Repeated
  listenings of the four corners of the album (before CDs)
  "Backstreets," "Jungleland," Thunder Road," and the title song
  are so good they become... well, addictive, works of genius, and
  lead to still more listening. "Tenth Avenue Freeze Out," "Night,"
  and especially "She's the One" could each be the centerpiece of
  almost any other album. Even the whispered "Meeting Across the
  River," fits and helps the album become a coherent whole. The
  songs taken together are more than the sum of the parts. As a
  footnote I'll offer the opinion that Bruce only wrote one other
  album that is as good as "Born to Run" and that is his next one,
  "Darkness on the Edge of Town." Everything he has released is
  good; a good bit of it is great, but I don't think anything else
  matches "Born To Run" or "Darkness." I don't know if two other
  back to back albums this good have ever been released. The DVD of
  the show gives us a big early peek at the guy who would develop
  into rock's greatest performer. By 1985 he would be the biggest
  rock star in the world, selling out multiple nights at football
  stadiums. The remastered CD is nothing special to my ears.
  Perhaps an audiophile could hear improvement. The DVD, "The
  Making of 'Born to Run,'" is interesting, but will probably
  appeal mainly to fans. However the DVD of the 1975 London show
  ought to appeal to anyone who likes Bruce, or rock &amp;amp;
  roll, or showmanship, or history. Its a treat</Text>
  <Text category="music">Thoroughly enjoyed the CD. Have some of
  the songs as performed by other artists, but it's nice to hear
  them as performed by the writer. I'm always impressed by one with
  that kind of creativity.</Text>
  <Text category="music">This outstanding effort by Prince consists
  of mostly spare jazzy R&amp;amp;B tunes, driven by incredibly
  loose, free-flowing live instrumentation. I could only begin to
  tell you about the stylistic variety on this album. With the
  three disc format there is a lot to absorb, and the third disc
  really can largely be done without, but the first two truly do
  rank amongst his best work. It should also be noted how
  especially romantic Prince is on this album. This album was made
  around the time that he entered into his first marriage, and it
  shows because this c.d. is overflowing with outstanding romantic
  ballads. Most of his albums only contain one or two ballads, so
  if you've been longing for an album that includes more, then this
  album should really appeal to you. This c.d. does not fit into
  the "standard" Prince "mold" ( I know that it is perhaps a bit
  oxymoronic to speak of a "Prince mold" but his personal signature
  is not quite as bold on this album as it is on many of his other
  works, even those that are admittedly not as good). The reason
  for this is that Prince follows rather than leads on a good
  portion of this album. The fact that there are two covers on the
  first disc alone shows that Prince was in the mood to do what was
  being done instead of doing something new (he covers songs by
  Bonnie Raitt and The Stylistics) which is unsual for this
  constant innovator, but this album is so great because he is so
  skillful that he does it better than almost anyone else. One
  minor problem that I notice is that it seems that on a few songs
  particularly on the first disc, Prince just doesn't pay much
  attention to the lyrics. There are too many generic R&amp;amp;B
  come-ons and cheesy cliche 90's catch phrases such as "gettin'
  your groove on', and Prince is much too clever, witty, and
  creative to resort to such things. But, really that is just a
  minor quibble because the music truly is consistently outstanding
  throughout the first two discs. And then, he has songs such as
  "Soul Sanctuary" and "Let's have a baby" which are two of the
  most well-written ballads that I've heard from him. "In this bed
  I scream" is just magnificent both lyrically and musically. He
  takes the lead again on this track and he does it in a major way.
  This clever, poetic, and romantic track has an infectiously
  catchy both rhythm and melody that would easily pack any dance
  floor. Other highly impressive moments include the high powered
  funk of "We gets up", the absolutely brilliant and stunning
  arrangement on "Curious Child", and the sincere, pure passion of
  the just so perfect R&amp;amp;B/gospel blend of "Savior". "Joint
  2 Joint" is impressive just for having so much variety in terms
  of sounds and elements, with each part so effectively enhancing a
  different part of the story. The first two discs are really solid
  overall. The third disc however finds Prince trying his hand at
  techno and other forms of conventional dance/club music, and the
  results are not very impressive. But, I don't see how they could
  be, even coming from Prince. Techno for the most part is insanely
  repetitive, monotonous, and downright drone-like. There are only
  three songs on disc three that were really worth it (Slave, My
  Computer, and the title track). Well, maybe four, his cover of
  "La la (means I love you)" is actually really good too. Those
  songs could have been put on the first two discs and the 3rd disc
  really could have been omitted. The most impressive feat that he
  manages to accomplish on this entire album is making a great
  chorus and a great song out of the line "www 'dot' emale `dot'
  com" on "Emale" :-). I was unaware of this feat for a while
  because I used to always skip this song because it started off
  with that really annoying 90's G-funk whistle. So overall, this
  album really does rank amongst Prince's best work, and it should
  especially appeal to those who would like to see him do more
  ballads and dive into more R&amp;amp;B</Text>
  <Text category="music">Rap music today is a tragic lack of
  creativity. Its not real hip hop. This album, brings back the
  good feeling that is real hip hop. Honestly, The Light is a song
  that never gets old, thats real. If you don't have this album,
  get it.</Text>
  <Text category="music">This CD is a confusing mix of punk bands,
  from pop-punk's Sum 41 &amp;amp;amp; Good Charlotte to punk
  favorites Alkaline Trio, Vandetta Red, &amp;amp;amp; The
  Casualties to bands that I've never even heard of such as Unsung
  Zeros, Ozma, &amp;amp;amp; Destruction Made Simple. I reccomend
  this CD if you're looking for new bands to like &amp;amp;amp;
  listen to. Although it's a confusing CD, it gives you new ideas
  of just how deep you're going to go in the punk
  underground</Text>
  <Text category="music">I would say that this is the closest that
  Cheap Trick ever got to making a perfect album. There are only
  two songs on here that I'm not one hundred percent crazy
  about...the slow and gloomy depressing title track and ' On the
  Radio ', which I think kisses up to radio D.J.'s too much. I love
  the rest of this. This album was my introduction to Cheap Trick
  and I would definitely recommend it to anybody as introduction to
  them. ' Surrender ' is an out and out classic and possibly my
  favorite Cheap Trick song of all time. Like most of the rest of
  the album, it's heavy, it's catchy, has great singing and
  interesting lyrics, and it says all it has to say in three to
  five minutes. ' Auf Weidersehen ' is another favorite tune of
  mine...it may be one of the heaviest tunes C.T. has ever done. I
  particularly love Bun E.'s energetic drumming on it. Zander
  really rips his vocal chords to shreads on this tune! Another
  great hard rocker is 'Stiff Competition'. Of the more pop
  oriented songs, I would say ' Taking Me Back ' is another
  personal favorite of mine. Probably should have been a hit, dang
  it! ' How Are You ' shows off the band's terrific sense of
  humor...I particularly like the reference to one of their earlier
  songs! The other tunes from the first half that I didn't mention
  are also terrific, particularly ' On Top Of The World '. My only
  complaint about this newly remastered version is that it doesn't
  include the lyrics, which WERE included on the original LP
  version. That is but a minor complaint. I don't think Cheap Trick
  ever made another album quite as great as this one.</Text>
  <Text category="music">I was waiting for this cd for a very long
  time, i mean i love all Greg's album, they are intense,
  passionate, but Amber Headlights is giving me back the soul of
  the Afghan Whigs, somenthing i missed a lot for a long time . I
  love his voice, the way he sing, the way he loves his music. You
  can t explain the beauty of this cd, there are great
  rock-blues-love songs:the first time i heard "So Thight" it makes
  me jump up and down my room (i haven t done it for long time
  since Black Love "Going to town"), then Cigarettes (what a great
  song, this time i only remember i was singing the chorus with
  "Gentleman" in my hand), then "Domani" that in italian means
  tomorrow, kind of Greg's jazz slow song in which his voice is so
  low that you can t even try to sing like that.Then song after
  song i realized is the best cd i ever bought after so many years.
  If you don t know anything about Afghan Whigs and Greg Dulli then
  it is time to start to listen one of the best alternative artist
  of our time.</Text>

  <Text category="music">I picked this up in a bootleg store in
  Korea a few years back, since it was cheap, and I had loved the
  movie (perhaps more so than any other of Mallicks's others, even
  - speaking of which, if you get a chance to see Badlands on the
  big screen, do yourself a huge favour and do so). As I recall, I
  didn't really enjoy it on first listen. But then, somehow, I got
  sucked in. Almost as much as the film itself, this is a hypnotic,
  haunting slice of poetry. Nothing happens for about a minute, and
  then it builds and builds. Unforgettable, otherwordly and quite
  beguiling. The structure of the soundtrack (especially the songs
  toward the end featuring Polynesian gospel-style singing) is
  strongly reminiscent of the Mike Oldfield cd, 'Songs of Distant
  Earth'. Highly recommended, but do give it a couple of listens,
  because it might take a while to make its charms felt</Text>
  <Text category="music">I was a music director at a college radio
  station when this came out, and along with a ton of other albums
  this one commanded my attention. Shoegazers??? I am sure all the
  label slinging yahoos are still wiping the egg off their faces.
  Its as if the band heard they were pigeonholed and gave them all
  the big finger. Just buy it...and all the rest</Text>

  kids who want to have fun and have fun without the TV! Hokey
  Pokey Baby...that's what it's all about</Text>
  <Text category="music">These guys and this album rocks. Just
  because the songs force you to move other parts of your body
  beside your head, doesn't 'demote' it to pop. Props to the great
  use of two bass guitars. Released amid the misery/grunge rock
  explosion of the early 90's, this was a great escape into rock
  that just simply made you feel good again. This album is highly
  recommended. Kill Your Television, Grey Cell Green, Cut Up,
  Throwing Things, Happy, and Until You Find Out are just an
  awesome experience. If you can find the Grey Cell Green single
  release, I highly recommend that for the track entitled
  'Trust.'</Text>
  <Text category="music">I just want to put it out there...Audra
  McDonald is an absolute genious. Everything she touches turns to
  gold, and I just want to smack some of you for saying that she
  failed in her attempt to make a great record. This may not be the
  audra that we are used to, but if you listen closely she's near
  by. So this CD is a little less difficult vocally. So what? My
  favorite quality of Ms. McDonald's is that she is emotionally
  connected to whatever she is singing. She could record twinkle
  twinkle little star and I would want to listen to it over and
  over again because she tells a story. So if you buy this CD,
  listen to it more than once. Let it grow on you. Let Audra do her
  thang children. Let her do her thang.</Text>
  <Text category="music">It's been a while since someone has sang
  the praises of this album. This is a timeless work. It never gets
  old no matter how many times it is played. I've had this album
  for 5-6 years and I pull it out every summer. Great music for
  boating or BBQ's on the deck. I promise you will love it.
  Something everyone should have in their collection</Text>
  <Text category="music">I've gotten a copy of this cd for every
  friend I have so they can know what I'm talking about when I
  crack a random joke. My mom even loves it and she would not be
  considered the 'target market'. For Mitch check out his first cd,
  if you can find it in stores, if not, go online</Text>
  <Text category="music">There are some amazing moments on this
  record. I find myself freaking out to three songs in a row, and
  waiting for the fourth song to end. The De La collaboration is
  weak; it's got the great Wild-Style instrumental but the chorus
  is obnoxious. Some of the more R&amp;amp;B-toned tracks fall flat
  in my opinion.</Text>
  <Text category="music">I was a big fan of this band's song
  "Rock'n'roll highschool", and I recently saw the documentary
  about them, so, when I saw this anthology selling for around $15
  in Australia, I thought I'd take a punt by buying it. My thoughts
  on this album are similar to the ones I had for the 3 CD Johnny
  O'Keefe collection [reviewed at this site by me]. Namely,
  overall, the album is very listenable, with some standout tracks.
  As with the JOK album, this album is/was great value for money,
  considering how many songs you get for the price. Of the songs I
  PARTICULARLY like on this album, and the ones I have been
  listening to quite a bit, are: Rock'n'roll High School. This song
  still rocks after all these years. Do you remember rock'n'roll
  radio? Good song, though it never got the airplay that the
  previous song seemed to get here in Australia. Chinese Rock. An
  Easter Egg song!! Never heard this song before, but it is an
  instant classic. Very catchy. Danny Says. Another Easter Egg
  song. Takes some repeated listening to get into, but once you do
  that, it gets high rotation on your cd player. To me, I can see
  why The Ramones are considered founders of Punk. At least as far
  as the music is concerned. However, The Sex Pistols truly DEFINE
  Punk for me. They have the whole package which I identify with
  Punk...namely, the punk sound, and the incendiary, anarchistic
  lyrics. The Ramones are more middle-class sounding, to my ears at
  least. I'm surprised at how poppy/boppy The Ramones are. To me
  they sound like a Punk Motown band. One of the songs on the 2nd
  cd, I think, has that classic punk sound, but I didn't make a
  note of the title. Might have to edit that song in later...could
  be "Endless Vacation"? Lastly, the song Danny Says, almost comes
  across as a Punk Beach Boys song. Overall, the anthology is often
  'samey', but listenable nonetheless, with a handful of songs that
  I consider 'high rotation' worthy. Just remembered, "Endless
  Vacation" seems a terrific song too. Will have to listen to that
  some more-I've currently got the 1st cd in my cd player. P.S.
  Listened to this song last night. Really good-the fast talking
  bit in the song reminds me of the equally good, if not better
  song by Australian act TISM [or This Is Serious Mum]-"[He'll
  never be an] ol' man River", about River Phoenix, amongst other
  people. TISM, like The Ramones, can do bad taste well.</Text>
  <Text category="music">This is one of my favorite releases from
  Common. This chi town warrior crafted an underground release that
  will bring a vibrant smile to the hardcore hip hop head and even
  awaken the minds of some of the fake commercial rap artist
  lovers. Songs like I used to love h.e.r and ressurection start
  the classic album and take you on the road to classic chicago hip
  hop. Not only the lyrics are dope but also the beats and the
  hooks. This is a pivotal album that needs to be in everyone's
  collectio</Text>
  <Text category="music">Wow, this album takes me back to the fall
  of '79, around the same time as MJ was taking over the world with
  his scorching solo debut "Off The Wall"!! Both of these albums
  got heavy rotation on my turntable and were house party
  essentials when I was a 15 yr old kid spinning the hot joints of
  the day! At this time, Prince was still a virtual unknown to the
  mainstream, but to a hip urban audience comprised mostly of
  blacks, gays, and ultra-hip whites who really knew what time it
  was, this LP served as notice that a "new thang" was brewin' in
  Minneapolis that was going to take the pop world by storm in a
  few short years! From the opening track, "I Wanna Be Your Lover",
  his first big single (gold) to the rockin' "Why You Wanna Treat
  Me So Bad?", which also was a single and a true fan fave!-- To
  "Sexy Dancer" which was sure to bring everybody to the dance
  floor and into a frenzy! Prince then cools down the mood with
  "When We're Dancing Close and Slow", which is just beautiful with
  its sparse piano and acoustic 12-string guitar--one of his many
  underrated slow jams of all time! Then Side 2 opened with the
  pretty "With You" and into the scorching rockalistic ode to
  female bisexuality.."Bambi", which still knocks me for a loop!
  I've had the pleasure of seeing him perform this song live twice
  down through the years.. once in 1980 during his "Dirty Mind
  Tour" and again in 1992 during his "Nude Tour" while I was
  overseas!--Awesome!! Then there's what I call "The Great
  Triplicate"... "Still Waiting" (another underrated slow
  classic!), followed by what is to me, the definitive version of
  "I Feel For You"(no disrespect to the great Chaka Khan!),
  followed by another underrated slow jam masterpiece "It's Gonna
  Be Lonely", which still sends me today at 41 the same as it did
  when I first heard it at 15! This album was Prince's first
  Platinum album, proving that he (at only 22) was indeed a
  hitmaker and one to watch! This album and the next one, "Dirty
  Mind", served as a changing of the gaurd from the older
  established innovators of that day like Stevie Wonder, Earth,Wind
  &amp;amp; Fire and Parliament / Funkadelic, etc. &amp;amp; is an
  essential if your collecting Prince classics! In fact, you can't
  go wrong with this kat between his debut, 1978's "For You" to
  1987's "Sign O' The Times"...it just doesn't get any
  better!</Text>
  <Text category="music">Growing up with Classical Rock and having
  enjoyed rock music by Rod Stewart, I didn't think I'd like this
  CD. One evening I was having dinner at a friend's home and they
  had this one playing. It was beautiful. Being a little older now
  (in my early 40's), I enjoy more mellow music than the head
  banging variety that is heard now. This CD of Rod's was
  nostalgic, romantic and extremely easy to listen to.</Text>
  <Text category="music">These guys are the best group out right
  now. Every single rapper is AMAZING even Bizarre who is not great
  so far as flow but probably has the funniest lyrics. This album
  brought me some of my favorite songs to date including Sh*t Can
  Happen, Pistol Pistol, Ain't Nuttin' But Music, American Psycho,
  Fight Music &amp;amp; Revelation. My favorite rappers are Swifty
  &amp;amp; Eminem but the fact is every one should have a solo
  album out by now (besides Em, only Proof (R.I.P.) &amp;amp;
  Bizarre do... which are my least favorite rappers in the group)
  Every song is great even the skits are enjoyable. If you don't
  have this yet, you are missing out on one of the best cds
  ever</Text>
  <Text category="music">Joan. You don't love me. Because I'm a
  guy. But I have loved you since 1976. Ok so I'm an old man (age
  43). So what. She's just the best rock and roll female on the
  planet. I like the young ones like Sahara Hotnights and the
  Donnas as well but they just don't measure up to Joan Born To Be
  Bad Jett. This album - like most of her other albums - consists
  of a mix of old and new songs. Doesn't mattar. I love it. And the
  video... well it confirms what we have always known. Not that it
  matters. The music matters</Text>
  <Text category="music">The series of "Golden Age of American Rock
  &amp;amp; Roll" released by ACE couldn't have a better end.
  During the past 15 years they have delighted us with a series of
  10 CD's with 30 songs each remembering the Rock &amp;amp; Roll
  era mostly with minor top hits between 1954 and 1963. One reason
  for their tremendous success is the superb quality of all the
  recordings no matter from what year the original song was. Now
  besides these series of 10 CD's from the R&amp;amp;R era they
  have launched another 2 special editions with the same title: one
  with the special novelty edition and another with the special
  country edition. Both deserve more than 5 stars. The song
  selection on the novelty edition is just out of sight! Most of
  the songs brought back memories from a long long time ago since
  these weren't available after the time they were top hits. I
  never found them back on what compilation so ever until ACE put
  them all together 45 years later. And with a sound quality better
  than in their original version on 45rpm. Therefore don't
  hesitate. Buy it together with the country edition and you will
  have 60 songs for utmost pleasure; 60 songs we grew up with and
  now with no scratches on them.</Text>
  <Text category="music">Nothing at all like boy-band CDs (InSync,
  Backstreet Boys, etc like editorial compared it to). While some
  of the songs are over-processed and don't allow Clay's strong,
  clear, and beautiful voice to shine through enough, it is overall
  a very good CD. It has some catchy tunes on it. His second CD,
  Merry Christmas With Love, allows his wonderful voice to shine
  through even more</Text>
  <Text category="music">this is the soundtrack that led me into
  the wonderful world of glam rock! it is outstanding and i could
  just play it again and again.... it is certainly one of the most
  brilliant albums out there and probably my favourite soundtrack
  of all time.</Text>
  <Text category="music">This album is absolutely beautiful. The
  full musical sound and talent of Calexico together with the
  soothing warm vocals of Iron &amp;amp; Wine make the perfect
  match. It's almost unheard of that I love EVERY song on an album,
  but this one makes the cut. Each song wraps you in a warm trance,
  a coccoon of well-being. It has a really positive emotional
  effect on me. It creates an ambiance of gentle strength.
  Wonderful. I really hope to see a these two bands getting
  together for more albums</Text>
  <Text category="music">I was at the Brighton concerts that these
  recordings were mostly taken from and as a reminder of two
  stunning nights of music they can't be better. Standout tracks
  include the two by Martha Wainwright, the two by Teddy Thompson,
  Perla Batalla's "Bird on a Wire", Rufus' "Chelsea Hotel" and
  (from the Sydney concert) Antony's "If it be your Will". Two
  major disappointments though; the inclusion of U2 as backing band
  for Leonard Cohen's own version of "Tower of Song" seems done for
  purely commercial reasons and doesn't work, and the nonsensical
  ommission of Linda Thompson's sublime take on "Alexandra
  Leaving". Here's hoping it's included on the dvd release</Text>
  <Text category="music">This is not only Brian Eno's best album,
  but one of the finest albums ever made--a work of simple beauty,
  complex intelligence, and imagination..</Text>
  <Text category="music">...because it felt like it predicted that
  I'd be listening to the cd someday. I'm referring to the line
  "The kids of AD 2000 will draw from the music much the same sense
  of well being and warmth that we do today." Now I admit that I
  was 18 in 2000 so I guess I technically missed the literal kid
  description by a year, but the more general prediction of the
  inter-generational, timeless appeal of the Beatles was right on.
  I didn't see them on the Ed Sullivan show. I was born almost
  twelve years after they broke up, and about a year after the
  tragic shooting of John Lennon. But I, like many, many other
  people born too late to have experienced Beatlemania as it was
  occuring, have since become a huge fan of all their work. This
  album has my favorite of all the Beatle's songs: I'll Follow The
  Sun. That song alone is worth the five stars, but thankfully the
  rest of the album is great too. This album gets a little bit too
  much grief, and it may not be quite as amazing as something like
  Abbey Road, but it's still better than just about anything else
  out there.</Text>
  <Text category="music">Call it American folk, call it
  alt.country, call it what you like, but if you heard this Aussie
  trio on CBS or NPR earlier this week, suffice to say their in a
  category all their own. Love that harmonica. Up All Night by the
  Waifs is appropriately titled. I'll be up all night listening to
  it</Text>
  <Text category="music">It's sometimes hard to think there are
  really anymore pleasing melodies out there, but thank Halstead
  &amp;amp; co. for proving me wrong. I am happily pleased with
  their latest, and very eagerly awaited, effort. Instead of the
  depths of melancholia and loveliness on, say, OUT OF TUNE, they
  give us 41+ minutes of what seems like basically "it's good,
  everything's going just way OK..." It's happy. Maybe I'll hear a
  lyric later that says something else, but for those for whom
  music is the priority, you can't go wrong with this considered
  and experienced and artful pop. Four and a half stars</Text>
  <Text category="music">I bought this CD on a whim after I heard
  Joaquin Phoenix was directing their "Tired of Being Sorry" video.
  Whoa! I was addicted! I couldn't stop listening to it...I had to
  get a 2nd copy for the car just so I could stop carrying it back
  and forth. GREAT driving music! The songs are catchy and have a
  great beat...I haven't heard anything this good in a long while.
  I had to have more immediately and luckily found some earlier
  stuff of Scott Thomas'....more on the acoustic/indie side, but
  awesome! I highly recommend Lovers &amp;amp; Thieves (CDbaby.com)
  My faves from Ringside are "Struggle", "Trixie", and "Dreamboat
  730". You will not be disappointed</Text>

  means, buy the soundtrack. you will not be dissapointed. Eevery
  time it listen it not only reminds me of the amazing movie, it

  <Text category="music">Attell is one of the few decent comics out
  there right now. I wasn't that big of a fan until I saw this in a
  record store and decided to give it a shot. I'm running out of
  comedy albums, there's not that many good ones out there. So I
  bought it and I was impressed. The audience is obviously drunken
  college kids who were very familiar with the show "Insomniac".
  They would laugh and scream if just slammed the microphone into
  his forehead the whole night. He has very good timing and
  delivery though and his jokes have very unpredictable punchlines
  for the first time you are hearing them. You never see the
  punchline coming a mile away. He is vulgar so if you are
  sensitive in any way to graphic sexual scenarios and profanity,
  stay away. He is one of the few that I enjoy now, tragically
  Mitch Hedberg died in March because he was another. The
  increasingly popular Dane Cook doesn't do it for me. Cook's
  Retaliation CD has broken all sorts of records for a comedy
  album. I think Cook is very marketable to the college,
  20something crowd, guys like him because he's the loud obnoxious
  drinking buddy from the frat, chicks think he's cute. I
  recommomend Attell myself, he is vulgar but is just a better
  comedian</Text>
  <Text category="music">umm...I don't think you quite got the
  point of this album. It is not about the artists that you like,
  it is about the artists that inspired Moore. Your ignorance
  forces me to do nothing but laugh. I find it funny that you feel
  you are making a point by saying "F*ck you SOAD" and so on. Have
  some respect for other's opinions. Unfortunately, you are a
  steriotypical "ignorant American".So with all that said, and with
  all due respect, I say, F*ck you pal</Text>
  <Text category="music">I'm a huge Matchbox fan and I listen to a
  collection of all 3 albums ALL DAY long. I never get tired of it!
  Rob Thomas has such a powerful voice that it just beckons to me.
  His lyrics are soul searching and speak directly to me. What a
  great band! What a great album! What a great musical ride!</Text>
  <Text category="music">This album is incredible. For me this is
  one of those few albums that defines a time in my life. An album
  that for months I played over and over. An album that I've played
  countless times, that I have passed out to when I came home after
  a late night, that I have ran to, and worked out to, that I play
  at work for a pick-me up. It's great. It's filled with so much
  emotion and passion, from beginning to end its just brilliant,
  the entire album. The songs are composed more like classical
  music with sweeping scores that start off slow and steady and
  then build up and explode into these intense jams. I love it. You
  have to buy this album. Then buy their next self titled album.
  Then play it and play it, and play it. It grows on you. I can't
  wait to see them live...</Text>
  <Text category="music">One of the best Doobie collections out
  there "Greatest Hits" lives up to its name focusing on the
  singles the band recorded and that charted in their long career.
  Some of the songs here are the single versions (meaning they were
  edited and are shorter than the album versions)and this might be
  a problem for some fans as they may want the full length versions
  of songs. Maybe it's because they were trying to squeeze more
  music onto the CD. Either way fans may want to be aware of that.
  In fact even on the boxed set we get "Listen to the Music",
  "Nobody" and "Rockin' Down the Highway" in their single
  incarnations. Perhaps its because that was the way fans
  originally heard them on the radio. Either way, fans looking for
  the full length versions of these songs would do well to pick up
  one of the import "Greatest Hits" collections or wait for the
  remastered CDs coming out later this year. This set does have one
  track not on the boxed set--"Without You" a great rocker. The CD
  booklet is exactly like the larger booklet that comes with the
  boxed set just laid out a bit differently. This definitely covers
  the highlights of the band's career whether it be the Tom
  Johnston rockin' years, Michael McDonald's blue-eyed soul stage
  or the band's reunion phase this has a bit of it all. Personally,
  I would love to see a two disc distillation of the band's
  "Greatest Hits" with a second disc of album tracks such as "I
  Cheat the Hangman", "Losin' End", "The Captain and Me" and "How
  Do the Fools Survive?". In the meantime this single disc
  compilation will have to do for most fans. The sound is terrific
  pulling from the remasters produced by Bill Inglot for the boxed
  set. Detail and clarity is remarkable and puts the previously
  issued "Best of" pair to shame. This is the only place to get
  their singles from their first in 1970 "Nobody" to their last
  (when this compilation was put togetherin 2001) "Dangerous"
  released in 1991.</Text>

  BIG difference and wtf sum 41 your kiding right sum 41 does not

  thing about music and another thing you poser is that Limp bizkit
  is NOT METAL they rap so how can you say that they scream ALL the
  time...limp bizkit is the WORST band out their they give a bad

  until you know more about music wich with the information i just

  <Text category="music">The Sundays come out with a CD once a
  decade, thus putting me in constant cravings for new material.
  Though Camera Obscura is very original and very much their own
  band, they satisfy the cravings that only Harriet Wheeler could
  touch. Truly vast and intimate at the same time, and a voice that
  speaks to something very deep, sad and lovely inside you</Text>
  <Text category="music">I used to listen to a friend's copy of the
  original "Metal Box" of EP's, when it first came out. Years later
  the "Second Edition" came out on LP's for those of us who hadn't
  sprung for the Metal Box before it sold out. Eventually the
  Second Edition came out on this CD. So I finally could own a
  digital copy myself. Pristine, audio quality at least as good as
  the original Metal Box in my opinion, if I remember correctly.
  You do need to listen to this. You do need to buy a copy and get
  other people to listen to this too</Text>
  <Text category="music">Michelle Branch carved out a place for
  herself in the young female pop singer market serveral years ago
  with a brilliant debut and a successful if derivitive duet with
  Carlos Santana. This record is her first with friend Jessica
  Harp. The ladies mine the borderline between the
  singer/songwriter and country genres for quality songs that
  should fit well in the americana format. Highlights include the
  opening track Leave the Pieces, Way Back Home, The Good Kind, and
  the title track Stand Still Look Pretty. Of special note is the
  presence of producer/multi-instrumentalist John Leventhal on many
  tracks. I recommend this record for folks who like songs that
  don't sound like formula country</Text>
  <Text category="music">What a great album this is, not only is
  the music a real pleasure to listen to, but the lyrics are a
  hoot! Wayne is not afraid to experiment, he skillfully combines
  old school elements with new in such a natural way. The songs
  pull you right in as if your listening to an old favorite you
  haven't heard in a long time. This album instantly became one of
  my favorites. I bought two more to give as gifts.</Text>
  <Text category="music">As with her second album, I love
  "Thankful". Kelly Clarkson has a beautiful voice and has a lot of
  talent. I especially like "Whats up lonely", "you thought wrong",
  and "just missed the train". Although the whole album is very
  good.</Text>
  <Text category="music">Just wonderful, wonderful! Even if you
  haven't seen the movie buy the music...so lovely and
  refreshing...of course, there is no one like Van Morrison (always
  and forever a 5-star), he tops the all-time charts for me...Kevin
  Kline is so smooth with La Mer...and the rest of the music is
  soulful and enchanting...you just can't miss with this one</Text>
  <Text category="music">The album is straight raw. Kurupt's
  lyrical abilities are unmatched and go hand in hand with Daz's
  Delivery. The G-Funk beats are the best they've ever sounded. As
  a whole, you will not skip one song at all. A+</Text>

  <Text category="music">1978 the stage is set for an album to
  emerge out of the crumbling decay that is the city of Cleveland.
  Just like their other fellow Ohion's DEVO, the guys in PERE UBU
  obviously saw the world in a slightly different way.I have owned
  this recording in various formats since 1980 and I have never
  grown tired of this album. I find this album to have an almost
  timless quality in that even though it was recorded over 25 years
  ago, if the original band itself tried to go back into the studio
  and re-record it, it just would'nt happen. There is just a
  certain magic that they captured in 1978, as to the music itself
  I tend to break - up this album into 2 distinct parts. Side One
  being the more accessible "drunken" side with more garage style
  sounds almost punk rock in its leanings guitar wise, but a little
  too intelligent, just listen to the lyrics.Side 2 is definately
  the "drug" side like a bad acid trip vocalist David Thomas takes
  you on a journey thru the seedy back streets of Cleveland(I have
  never heard smashing bottles sound so creepy or atmospheric) and
  the rest of the band help to re-inforce this craziness by going
  off in a million different directions.I could give you a track by
  track anylisis of this record but suffice to say that music is
  somethig you should anylize, experience and consume at your own
  leisure, and then form your own opion of what each of the songs
  on this album mean to you. So if you loved things like Throbbing
  Gristle's song Hamburger Lady then u will surely love Pere Ubu's
  album the Mordern Dance.As another reviewer mentioned before
  Black Francis of The Pixies fame must have almost certainly
  listened to these guys.I also hear there influences in recent
  bands such as Portishead and Queens of the Stone Age just to name
  a few.So if you enjoy bold experimental music that is still as
  fresh sounding as it was in 1978 then give your ears a chance to
  have a listen to this album, even if you have to beg,steal or
  borrow it.</Text>
  <Text category="music">this is my favorite ghostface slbum. it
  has a geat vibe to the cd and you could not get sick of hearing
  it. check it out and you wont be dissapointed. rating A</Text>
  <Text category="music">I feel bad doing this becuase I love Iggy
  and the stooges but the quality on this set is pretty bad. All
  the live recordings are worth listening to and probably owning
  but the quality is very rough and can get frustrating. It's like
  the first Beatles Anthology set: the material is amazing but the
  quality is bad. On the plus side the studio outtakes are decent
  quality wise and amazing content wise. The packaging is also very
  nice. I just though I'd share this information before you drop
  all the money on the set. If you are a Stooges fan don't hesitate
  purchase now but if this is your introduction you should probably
  wait.</Text>
  <Text category="music">The Four Seasons have always been one of
  my favorite groups. I think Frankie Valli has one of the best
  voices in the world and without the doubt the greatest falsetto
  in existence, and the rest of the group had harmonies that only
  The Beach Boys could match. nd for band that has had as any hits
  as them are destined to have a barrage of greatst hits
  collection. Up until now, I always felt the best way to obtain
  all the Four Seasons' best songs was by getting Rhino's single
  disc "The Very Best Of The Four Seasons". Well, I was wrong. "In
  Season: The Frankie Valli and the 4 Seasons Anthology" is the
  definitve Four Seasons collection. On these two discs, you find
  all the essential Four Seasons songs, including "Sherry", "Big
  Girls Don't Cry", "Walk Like A Man", "Dawn (Go Away)", "Rag
  Doll", "Let's Hang On (To What We've Got)", "Working My Way Back
  To You", "Opus 17 (Don't You Worry 'Bout Me)", "Tell It To The
  Rain" (an often forgotten Top 10 hit and my favorite Four Seasons
  song ever), "Who Loves You" and "December 1963 (Oh, What A
  Night)". But the majority of the cd is a wealth of rarities,
  including many songs that were either album tracks, uncharted
  singles or Frankie Vali solo singles. Plus, you get it for about
  $25.00, which I consider fairly cheap for a cd with 51 songs. The
  30+ page booklet is excellent, filled with track information
  (chart positions, etc.), rare photos and an excellent essay
  written by Pat Sierchio. This is an absolute must have</Text>

  <Text category="music">Dave Alvin's sublime new CD is a cadre of
  songs written by Californians either born and/or who grew up in
  this land. The lyrics talk about what it means to live and love
  in the land of dreams and broken promises. It is also a look at
  the story of the frontier in this large western state. Dave Alvin
  has a voice that is deep and smooth and like a friend of his said
  "infiltrates your brain like a shot of Jack Daniels." Dave Alvin
  says "We started with a list of 25 songs, from Steve Gillette to
  Captain Beefheart and everything in between. I was even thinking
  of doing 'Going Back to Cali' as a blues thing. In the end,
  though, it wasn't about choosing my favorite songs so much as
  choosing songs that I could sing well enough and arrange
  differently enough to make them interesting." He has picked these
  songs carefully and each of them fit his style and voice well. Of
  them all, and I like each and every one, my two favorite
  interpretations are "Here In California" and "Surfer Girl"
  "California Bloodlines" is a sentimental rendition of John
  Stewart's fine work, which finds peace in knowing "There's
  California bloodlines in my heart / There's a California woman in
  my song ... And a California heartbeat in my soul." "Redneck
  Friend" the Jackson Brown less well known song was just right for
  Dave Alvin's style. "Kern River" is a song Merle Haggard wrote
  after losing his best friend, and it is a melancholy rendition.
  "Blind Love" from Tom Waits is sung in a bluesy style with some
  doo wops thrown in to give it style. "Here in California" one of
  my favorites is sung with Christy McWilson. He felt this song
  needed a woman's perspective. "I'm Bewildered" is an old Richard
  Berry, the great guitarist's tune. Backed up by The Calvenes.
  "Sonora's Death Row" written by Blackie Ferrell is a fable that
  examines the price of acting out of greed and anger and ends up a
  as gun fighter's tale. "Down On the Riverbed" is an old Los Lobos
  song that is sung in Dave Alvin's old blues style. "Between the
  Cracks" a song written by Dave Alvin and Tom Russell is a
  heartbreaking tale of young boy told by a loving woman, with a
  rollicking tune. This is the only Dave Alvin orignal song in this
  CD. "Don't Look Now" a song sung by John Fogerty is an old
  Creedence Clearwater revival. Bluesy and fun to make it Dave's.
  "Tramps and Hawkers" by Jim Ringer is a delicate country waltz,
  come dance with me, BK. Lyrics are wonderful. "Loser" by Jerry
  Garcia and Robert Hunter, is darker with more infused blues than
  Garcia's version. It couldn't sound less like a Deadhead song.
  Dave Alvin put in a psychedelic section that is a tribute to the
  San Francisco sound "Surfer Girl" Brian Wilson's first song is
  done with doo-wops and again The Calvanes did background. This is
  my favorite of Dave Alvin's interpretations, and he sings this
  surfin'song with some tongue in cheek. Dave Alvin gives voices of
  California to this CD. Voices from the California coastline and
  the surf music it inspired to the "brown earth of the state" to
  the frontier life and the lives won and lost. Dave Alvin had made
  his mark on this state, and the writers who loved their lives by
  writing and singing about the state they love. Play it often and
  pay attention to the subtle influence of this CD. "California
  Dreamin'?" Highly recommended. prisrob 6-04-06</Text>
  <Text category="music">Before I review this classic Rolling
  Stones album, I just want to point out that Juke Box Hero and
  whirligig are one in the same person. A troll who likes to trash
  great music and praise Dire Straits(who are a good band but nit
  the greatest) and Green Day. I say CUT THE SHENANIGANS! Now that
  is off my chest, back to the review! The Rolling Stones' second
  album to be released on their own label fittingly called Rolling
  Stones Records, which was distributed by Atlantic at the time(now
  Virgin/Capitol), entitled Exile on Main Street was released in
  May of 1972. The album was the band's only double studio album
  but is one of rock's greatest double studio albums in history and
  ranks up there with other classic 2-record sets like The Wall,
  Quadrophenia, The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway and Tommy among
  others. Before guitarist Keith Richards' heroin addiction took
  over for some time in the mid-1970s, he was what the late
  producer Jimmy Miller called a workhorse. The album was recorded
  at Keith's home in France and at Olympic Studios in London and
  Muscle Shoals in Alabama and in Los Angeles. Keith's music and
  frontman Mick Jagger's lyric writing was arguably at its peak on
  Exile on Main Street. Songs like the opening rocker Rocks Off,
  the 50s sounding rocker Rip This Joint, the album's hit Tumbling
  Dice, the country-ish Sweet Virginia, Keith's classic rocker
  Happy(and it is his most famous track which he sang), the
  slow-ish Soul Survivor, the fast-paced blues rocker All Down the
  Line and the soul sounding Shine a Light are classics which sound
  like they could have been recorded yesterday. Ventilator Blues
  was another highlight as it was the only song that Mick and Keith
  wrote was co-written by guitarist Mick Taylor whom just tore the
  place up from 1969-74(his solos just rocked from 1969-74). Exile
  on Main Street was The Rolling Stones' second consecutive #1
  album and another million seller. The tour in support of the
  album saw the band getting bigger and bigger. Almost 35 years on,
  this album is still a classic! This album is hugely
  recommended</Text>
  <Text category="music">I had originally heard "Drive Away" on a

  in the Suit, man, they did that after Shangri la de and I wonder,
  if this was the direction to come, my god!!!! It's worth it for
  that track alone.. 5 stars is my own way of saying thank you, but
  it is not just sentimental, the only album in the short career
  that wasn't great was Tiny Music, but the quote "Trippin" made up
  for it. It's a shame it's over. I don't like revolver, it's not
  evolution for Weiland and I can't imagine him being happy there,
  it steps back and all I ever hoped was that someday this band,
  STP, would reign supreme and been given the praise and adulation
  they deserve. ALl i can do is give stars, but I would rather buy
  another STP album or go see them live...is rock dead? I think it
  is and it went with this band</Text>
  <Text category="music">Well, here we are. One of the true works
  of the electronic genre in the 90's, "Lifeforms" is true sonic
  adventure. This is obviously some of the best work that FSOL ever
  did. "Lifeforms" is a double album of electronic and ambient
  moments spliced together, interchanged and meshed. For ambient
  work, it has a lot of randomness and bright detail thrown in at a
  rapid pace. There is a lot of energy and terse grab to the songs,
  despite their being ambient. It is very original, I praise
  originality in music. Give it a try, put on some "Flower" "Bird
  Wings" or some "Elaborate Burn.</Text>
  <Text category="music">I'm really not sure what the purpose of
  this Disc is, other than as an Adam Ant filler for those
  collectors who need to add more to their collection. This is a
  slightly scaled down version of the truly best of "Antics in the
  Forbidden Zone" which detailed Adam Ant's career up until the
  bombastic "Apollo 9" album. "Essential" adds the 1990 single
  "Room at the Top" from "Manners &amp;amp; Physique" album and
  "Wonderful" from the 1995 "Wonderful" album. These two songs are
  not really worth the cost of admission and I think are probably
  the weakest songs on those two albums, anyway. And of course
  "Essential" ignores the unreleased 1993 album "Persuasion" which
  had some really good songs on it. If you want later period Adam
  Ant, "Manners" is really good and "Wonderful" is, well, less than
  wonderful, but still a worthwhile Adam Ant. If you want an
  introduction to Adam Ant, the chronologically catalogued "Antics"
  is great and a more complete collection!</Text>
  <Text category="music">I love jazzy hip-hop of the early '90s and
  if you do too,this is the album you must listen to! all the songs
  are wonderful but there are some of these which are something of
  supernatural like the famous (and the most beautiful of the
  entire cd!) "Award Tour", "Steve Birko(stir it up)" and
  "Midnight". enjoy this pearl of REAL hip-hop!!!</Text>
  <Text category="music">...wandering through the dorms in the
  1970's this was one of those albums that was in everyone's
  collection. It was usually very near the front of the record
  stack. Every time I hear that opening guitar riff from Reelin' in
  the Years I glide back to a very nice place in time. If you hope
  to understand the evolution of US pop/rock music you need to
  become intimate with this recording!</Text>
  <Text category="music">This is some great music from a litte know
  movie. You won't be let down</Text>
  <Text category="music">The more I listen to this album, the more
  I love it. What's sounds somewhat familiar even formulaic at
  first becomes totally captivating on further listening. Like a
  girl you thought was nothing special at first glance but then
  becomes beautiful as you get to know the complete package. This
  is one cooooool CD.</Text>
  <Text category="music">I love these albums. Get all 3 cause they

  just great. Every song is better than the last. You can't go
  wrong with Collin Raye and you can't find anyone with a better
  voice. Buy this one</Text>
  <Text category="music">The first time I read this book was at the
  age of 13. My mother had an old, worn, 1950s copy of the book on
  our bookshelf, and one day I just decided to give it a try. I
  think the first 50 pages were a bit of a mystery to me. I
  remember struggling with the language at the beginning, and
  having to look up several words in the dictionary. After 100
  pages, I had finally "learnt the language," and managed to at
  last translate it into my native tongue. I enjoyed it, and over
  the years I returned to it again and again. Now, at the age of
  35, I practically have numerous passages memorized, and reading
  the book is no longer a culture shock. Every word of this novel
  is an old friend, and I wouldn't remove a single one from the
  text. This is the book I turn to when I'm in the mood to read,
  but not in the mood to read something new. Every time I read it,
  I am struck by its relevance. I don't mean the morals or the need
  to marry well in order to win approval from society (although I
  think we still see a little of that to this day). I refer to the
  characters. Their personalities and basic code of principals are
  timeless. I can identify with every single character in this
  novel. When Lizzy and Mr. Darcy fell in love, their courtship
  could have taken place anywhere and at any point in time. That is
  why her novels are so well adapted into modern films. You cannot
  possibly do wrong by reading this novel</Text>
  <Text category="music">Like many of the highly talented and
  innovative groups of the 1980's, The Pet Shop Boys were ahead of
  their time. This album was purchased mainly for "West End Girls"
  and "It's a Sin." Play this album from beginning to end without
  interruption - it's fantastic. "Loves Comes Quickly" emerges for
  me as the best of The Pet Shop Boys remarkable and unique sound -
  a composition reflecting orchestral complexity and pulsating
  energy. The great contributions of Great Britain and Australia to
  music in the 1980's in my opinion comes largely from their
  composers and performers effectively combining the power and
  harmonic complexity of some classical music compositions of the
  mid 1920's to the early 1950's (no doubt the origins of some
  great movie scores) with the emerging sophistication and always
  present upbeat effect of rock and roll. You will love The Pet
  Shop Boys</Text>
  <Text category="music">i recently saw them in san francisco just
  like one of the other reviewers, and i thought it was
  astonishing. i know a lot of people got mad cause they didnt move
  around or anything, i mean it couldn't be because they were
  trying to concentrate or anything like that! the great thing
  about this album is that all the instruments standout at the same
  time. farina(the lead singer)has calmed down after the last
  couple of albums and often times speaks his lyrics in a soft and
  heartfelt way that make you wish you could get into a
  conversation with him right then and there.and his guitar playing
  has even matures after the bed is in the ocean. the drummer just
  flat out rocks. his punctuality is a lot of the reason why these
  guys are so tight. the bass speaks just as well as the guitar
  does and sometimes takes over as the guitar holds it together and
  the bassist go off on his own little excursion. well, if you have
  a problem with a band not rocking out, i dont know what to tell
  you. it is jazzy, but let me be the one to tell you this is the
  best jazz i've heard. i think this is the only path they could of
  taken. you got to evolve. sometimes that cant always be a good
  thing but in this case ,karate is the exception. love this</Text>

  <Text category="music">Brian Regan is simply a comedic genius.
  This cd is especially funny after having seen him live--you can
  just picture his hilarious gestures and facial expressions! He
  has managed to create a hysterical routine based on the silly
  stuff we've all said/done/thought. While I too enjoy comedians
  who are more "cutting edge", I don't think a routine has to be
  peppered with profanity to be funny. This cd is well worth any
  price; check out his DVD and his live show, too</Text>
  <Text category="music">You can resume EDDIE COCHRAN very well
  with one cd.After all,when he died he was only 21 years old.This
  selection is almost the same if you except 5 songs of the
  LEGENDARY MASTER SERIES released in 1990.His best songs are
  there:SUMMERTIME BLUES was of course a favorite of THE WHO ,who
  often featured it in their concerts.I am particularly fond of
  JEANNIE,JEANNIE,JEANNIE,C'MON EVERYBODY and the marvellous
  SOMETHIN'ELSE with it's great shuffle,a trademark of EDDIE.If you
  are interested in rock's early days,you'll enjoy this cd</Text>
  <Text category="music">If you were lucky enough to buy the
  soundtrack when first released in 1987 on Enigma Records, hang on
  to that out of print gem! Straight To Hell is back on CD as
  Straight to Hell Returns, and may have a lot more tracks this
  time, but it also deleted two tracks from the original release
  and shortens another track. Not appearing this time are: "The
  Good, The Bad And The Ugly" by The Pogues, and my personal
  favorite "Money, Guns And Coffee" by Pray For Rain. The track
  "The Killers" by Pray For Rain ran 2 minutes 55 seconds on the
  original, but on this new release was shortened to only 2
  minutes. This is rather perplexing considering Straight To Hell
  Returns runs a total of 55 minutes 7 seconds, which would have
  left room for those other tracks to be included (since CDs can
  run a total of 79 minutes 59 seconds). I'm deducting a point from
  my rating of this CD because the missing tracks should have been
  included! On the plus side, this new release contains a lot of
  short instrumental tracks from the film that were not on the
  original CD release in 1987, as well as some brief dialogue
  excerpts. The film was a misunderstood classic, and the
  soundtrack of spaghetti western-style rock is wonderful: The
  Pogues, Joe Strummer, Pray For Rain, Zander Schloss, Elvis
  Costello's MacManus Gang, and even dialogue excerpts from
  Courtney Love before she was, well, I guess the word is "famous."
  If you're a fan of any of these artists, you'll love this
  assortment of songs...those not familiar with the film may not be
  able to absorb the atmosphere these songs and instrumentals
  create, so get the film on DVD and you'll appreciate the works of
  these artists so much more. The liner notes claim this CD is to
  be considered the "official" soundtrack, while the first release
  of it back in 1987 was basically a "souvenir." I enjoy both
  releases immensely, but since I was listening to those other
  deleted tracks for nearly 20 years now, it's sad to not hear them
  this time around</Text>

  <Text category="music">I'm just starting to become a true fan of
  Pigpen. Earlier, I just didn't get him and I would constantly
  skip forward to more of the GD extended jams. Lately, I've
  started to get what he was all about and what made him such an
  important part of the early dead shows. I'm glad I picked up this
  set. It's Pigpen's night and we should all be happy for this nice
  memory. Pick it up. Note: the rest of the band has some fine
  moments too!!</Text>
  <Text category="music">At the end of the day, when you come home
  from school or work, one can't say &amp;amp;quot;I feel
  great.&amp;amp;quot; Rather than great, we are stressed and
  tired. The sounds of falling rain is evermore relaxing that this
  CD captures it it almost perfectly. I too, am always stressed at
  the end of a work day and have relaxed to the sound of falling
  rain; and it does work. It would also be helpful to listen to
  while sleeping. With quiet, natural sounds, it will have a
  soporific effect on its listeners and relax you</Text>
  <Text category="music">If this is to truly be GYBE's last piece
  of work, then they've concluded their brief and dynamic catalog
  on a fitting note. While I still believe "Lift Yr. Skinny
  Fists..." is their masterwork, "Yanqui" is easily a close second.
  Where "Fists" had a broader range of sounds and textures -
  elements of sacred and profane - "Yanqui" is more balanced and
  focused. Although you could argue this point, I think "Yanqui"
  never gets as high or low as "Fists." The sound on "Yanqui" is
  entirely consistent with their previous releases. As other
  reviewers mentioned, the only major change is the absence of
  field recordings, which actually helps to distinguish this album
  as the finale. The lack of human voice adds a new aura of mystery
  to the work. Well, there is actually another surprising moment on
  this album: it happens during a movement about halfway into the
  album. The guitars drop off, leaving only a small ensemble
  playing dissonant woodwinds over a steady tribal percussion. For
  a few minutes it definitely doesn't sound like typical GYBE. In
  fact, the dissonant horns sound almost like a Ligeti composition
  (although Ligeti probably wouldn't have used a steady rhythm of
  any kind). Fear not. Not only does it work, but it swells nicely
  into a full band tidal wave. But here's the most important point
  I want to make about Yanqui: To me, it resolves some of the
  musical themes "Fists" introduced, which makes U.X.O. a fitting
  conclusion. The last bit on "MFer=Redeemer P.1" slows way down,
  featuring one guitar with one violin (i think) playing together
  in fragile harmony, along with some distortion in the background.
  When I listen to this, I can't help but think of the very
  beginning of "Fists," except the melody changes just enough to
  resolve the paranoia that the "Fists" melody introduced. In other
  words, it's like I can hear GYBE - at last - acknowledging that
  there does exist some...hope!...some goodness!....some
  peace!...in this world - the very place that's inspired them to
  make such dissonant music. And, well, if GYBE can slow down and
  acknowledge something hopeful exists, well then, hope must exist.
  Indeed, mother****er does = redeemer. Of course, they give us one
  last act on "Yanqui" just to kick our butts one final time. Yes,
  it gets so out of control that, at one point, the siren that's
  blaring in the background seems appropriate. The very end, I
  love, as it builds and builds and builds with distortion and
  droning until the music finally-- it suddenly ends. "Yanqui
  U.X.O." is possibly the final act in a brief but brilliant
  catalog. It's an awesome finale</Text>
  <Text category="music">I have been a Barry Manilow fan since I
  was a teenager. I have NEVER been disappointed with any of his
  work and this CD is no exception! He is such a brilliant arranger
  and the remix of these classics is fabulous! His voice is as good
  as ever! Even my 7 year old begs to listen to the CD everytime we
  get in the car and she can sing all the words!</Text>
  <Text category="music">I read some of the other reviews before I
  submitted this. I don't see how someone could get upset over the
  liner notes. Redd doesn't include Danny Gatton as an influence
  because he didn't listen to him. As far as other reviews
  concerning tone and the lack of fire, well, I don't even know how
  to address that. Redd has one of the best tones I've heard on the
  tele and his note selection is what sets him apart from other
  pickers. Ever hear of diarrhea of the guitar? Well, you won't get
  that on this CD because Redd doesn't play something to just play
  it. This CD showcases Redd's versatility from country, to swing,
  to blues, to rock, it has it all. If you like good pickin', then
  by this CD</Text>
  <Text category="music">I was already a fan of Mike and the
  Jacksons, But when Motown 25 came on in 83, this guy set the
  standard for what music and performance could be and where it
  could go. Till this day in my lifetime that one performance at
  Motown 25 is the single most perfect performance I've ever seen.
  I remember the next day at school and the next month after that
  performance we had all kind of talent shows where all of the kids
  were trying to out moonwalk each other. The saddest and funniest
  part was watching the less fortunate kids who could not afford
  the Michael gear wearing tube socks with dress shoes and kids
  making home made glitter and rhinestone gloves. Hilarious. As an
  adult, I refuse to let the media and even Michael himself ruin my
  childhood memories of this untouchable piece of music. 24 years
  later Thriller remains the album to beat</Text>
  <Text category="music">Review no.77.A superbly/nicely done
  reissue of The Zombie's second 'actual' album(isn't it?).Total of
  27 tracks,so since the first twelve(12)cuts were the original
  lp,I guess that means you get seventeen bonus tracks,wow!That's a
  lot,for a one-disc release.A fine CD to repeatedly play,plus keep
  in your 'current rotation' stack for a long time to come.It's
  PROBABLY just me,but these tunes SHOULD be in a different playing
  order.That's why I'll sometimes pre-program this CD before I
  listen to it.Loads of fabulous/memorable tunes to enlighten your
  evening with here,like "Care Of Cell 44"(three versions,but
  welcome),"Time Of The Season"(stereo and mono versions),the
  beautifully-done melodic "A Rose For Emily"(2 versions),"I Want
  Her,She Wants Me","Maybe After He's Gone" and a cut that I've
  certainly never heard before,but was quite impressed with
  it,"Butchers Tale".Obviously,The Zombies must've had hours of
  unreleased material that most of the world didn't take great
  notice of,until now.Simply,a must-have.Timeless top rate British
  Invasion rock&amp;amp;roll that'll never truly die</Text>
  <Text category="music">Right, so by putting a review down for
  this album, I am getting labeled as an emo kid who wears his
  sweater too tight, cuts himself and cries over his girlfriend all
  day long, well too bad that's not me, I am just a normal person
  who can tell the diference between bad and good music. Hawthorne
  Heights is an emo band who are criticised by lots and loved by
  lots of others, I have to agree that their lyrics are quite
  simplistic and are used over and over, they might even sound gay
  at some points, although, "we are so last year" made me laugh "I
  should have known you better, i should blame it on the weather"
  wtf is that??? Anywyas so the lyrics are probably the reason why
  I'm giving this 4 and not 5. But here we're talking music not
  lyrics. The music has nothing very special to it and I can play
  every song on guitar, they often use the same chords except for a
  few songs "This Is Who We Are", but they have a lot of
  interesting melodies and don't just rely on power chords to make
  their music interesting. Even though these chord sequences are
  often re-used, Hawthorne Heights always manage to make their
  sound diverse and interesting and they are slowly imposing
  themsleves as the kings of knock-out choruses. The other thing I
  have noticed in this album is that there are much less screaming
  parts which is an improvement and the guitarist has finally
  learnt where his place is in the band (behind his guitar) but
  also when is a good time to scream and when it isn't. This makes
  them quite different from most other emo bands who literaly
  destroy their sound with high shrieks. Hawthorne have become a
  little darker and even tune down their guitars in some of their
  songs now adding a bit more heavyness. Also check out "Where can
  I stab myslef in the ears" to see how hawthorne have improved.
  Overall this is a step forward from their last album, it won't
  change the emo scene forever, but it will leave its mark in your
  memories and will give you a good moment when listening to
  it</Text>
  <Text category="music">I am a lover of "greatest hits" compact
  discs but this one by far is the best one I have purchased
  recently. This compact disc has almost all of the best tunes that
  Joe Walsh made and I highly recommend it to anyone who loves to
  rock!</Text>
  <Text category="music">With his snarling, gritty guitar tones,
  swampy grooves, and scratchy vocals, C.C. Adcock makes
  butt-shakin' music that blends rockabilly, old-school Memphis
  R&amp;amp;B, New Orleans funk, Cajun dancehall tunes, and
  juke-joint blues. He's young, but no poseur: Having paid dues
  with Bo Diddley and Buckwheat Zydeco, Adcock knows rootsy
  textures like the back of his hand. But despite the tremolo
  guitar and slapped upright bass, this isn't a retro-sounding
  record. Adcock and his various producers bring a hip sonic edge
  to the music that keeps the moods fresh and the vibe ominous.
  Doyle Bramhall joins Adcock on two songs, and together they raise
  6-string hell. Boasting richly layered guitars and heaps of
  attitude, Adcock's music is soulful, somewhat twisted, and deeply
  satisfying</Text>
  <Text category="music">Too bad this group supported by Keith
  Sweat didn't go any further. I bought it for one song, but the
  whole CD is great for listening. Lyrics contain songs about love
  and such, and I like they way speak about it. It gives you
  something to look forward to.</Text>
  <Text category="music">I am just writing this review to correct
  Alexander from Russia, who cites this album as a Christianity
  peddler. Leonard Cohen is a Jew, who unlike Bob Dylan (on John
  Wesley Harding) embraces his sense of Jewish heritage and
  religion within his music. Alexander, you've brought your own
  interpretation to what is a distinctly Jewish artist and his
  work</Text>
  <Text category="music">Hounds is an outstanding piece of work.
  Two outstanding pieces of work if you look at it properly. The
  first consisting of five individual songs, though all with a very
  similar feel and texture. The second is a conceptual set of songs
  called The Ninth Wave, which has had many meanings read into it.
  All five tracks from the first piece are excellent. The opening
  track, Running Up That Hill, is possibly Kate's greatest single
  of all time (up there with Wuthering Heights and Babooshka), it
  is a powerful song with simple but highly emotional lyrics. It
  has been reworked by Aussie outfit Infusion in recent years and
  become a big dance floor anthem for the likes of John Digweed and
  DJ Tiesto. It had lost none of it's appeal or sense of urgency
  over time. The title track is a beautiful, upbeat song. Again it
  has made a resurgence in the last year, thanks to mod-rock UK
  band The Futureheads. The Big Sky is my favourite (You want my
  reply? What was the question? I was looking at the big sky!). The
  extended mix is great and available on the 1997 EMI remastered
  release of Hounds. Mother Stands For Comfort is a little out of
  place, dark and eerie it would have felt right at home on The
  Dreaming. Kates vocals are, in my opinion, sublime on this track.
  The fantastic song, Cloudbusting, nearly deserves a review on
  it's own. A masterpiece in modern pop, it tells one of the best
  stories I've ever heard in a pop song, and combines it with one
  of the best video clips I've ever seen. The Ninth Wave is beyond
  review. You need to buy this LP and listen to it over and over
  again. It will mean different things to different people, and I
  think that is what makes it so amazing. Commonly interpretted as
  the story of a woman drowning, I have weaved several meanings
  through the story at various times of my life, but each ends
  happily - the whimsical The Morning Fog makes sure of it... Else,
  just put it on and lose yourself in the soundscape, read nothing
  into it and take the Ninth Wave for a musical ride. That's my
  favourite way to listen to it. Finally, if you ever need to test
  the ability of a piece of sound equipment, say the $2000
  amplifier you're about to splurge on, take the remastered LP as
  your test. The percussion should be clear, the vocals crisp and
  the stereo separation precise. An outstanding LP in every
  way!</Text>
  <Text category="music">Need to say more? This is one of the most
  beautiful and honest records western popular music ever seen. She
  sings beauty, so lovely, as some fairy enchanting gnomes in a

  will lasts till the end. Druids of the world unite</Text>
  <Text category="music">what a beautiful album! one of the rare
  albums that has no fillers or weaker cuts. i'd call it a classic
  but that makes it sound dusty. these songs could come out in 20
  years and still sound fresh.</Text>
  <Text category="music">REM has had a helluva lot of hits, and has
  remained a radio staple and has been a big influence on later
  bands. This 18-track album does a good job for its length, but I
  really do feel a 2-CD hit package is warranted. The biggest
  omissions are "Shiny Happy People," "It's the End of the World as
  We Know It," and "This One Goes Out to the One I Love." It
  wouldn't surprise me if the band didn't really like these songs
  and would rather not include them in their greatest hits
  collection. However, there are a few other more minor hits I know
  from them that are missing, like "Radio Free Europe." I just
  can't think of other titles right now, but there are more than a
  few other omissions too. Many of the minor hits that are included
  here, thankfully, are very good and will grow well on you: "The
  Great Beyond," "Bad Day," "All the Way to Reno," "E-bow the
  Letter," and "Imitation of Life" are songs I haven't heard enough
  of and I'm glad they are on this collection. Still, I hear REM is
  coming out with another compilation and I imagine it will be more
  complete; I suggest waiting for that album when it comes
  out</Text>
  <Text category="music">I had been hearing "Always Thinking Of
  YOU." But, I never got who it was. I purchased XM radio and on
  the smooth jazz channel, I heard the cut again and got the artist
  name. Purchased the CD based on that one cut. Every cut is great
  on this cd. I look forward to catching him live at some point and
  will continue to look for more from him in the future. He has his
  own style. But, not only do you hear hints of Benson and
  Brown..........I hear a little Doc Powell as well. I will be
  introducing friends to this great artist............Keep it
  coming............</Text>
  <Text category="music">Following the demise of Soundgarden in
  1997, everyone was curious what Chris Cornell would do next.
  Would he immerse himself in another band where he could display
  his blood-curdling screams or would he surprise everyone with
  something totally different? He chose the latter. With Natasha
  Shneider on keys and Alain Johannes on guitars, Cornell found the
  opportunity to break away from his heavily Zeppelin and
  Sabbath-rooted musical background, and he also asked some other
  musicians to make an appearance on the record. The result is a
  very diverse album, highlighting Cornell's immediately
  identifiable vocals and relatively more simpler songwriting. That
  said, he had the chance to incorporate a multitude of other
  instruments, including tambourine, theremin, and timpani. Besides
  the trademark blues rock-ridden songs that helped Cornell make a
  name for himself, he also digs deep into psychedelia, best heard
  on "Preaching the End of the World", a song that finds Cornell
  opting for thick, Radiohead-like arrangements, lofty acoustics,
  and a strange mix of keyboard and guitar effects. Not too
  different is "Disappearing One", guesting Soundgarden drummer
  Matt Cameron with its moving vocal melodies, shimmering keyboards
  and even a vague clarinet addition. Surely, Soundgarden fans
  expecting a very heavy record with meaty guitars and lots of
  aggressive vocals will be sorely disappointed. But they need to
  realize Euphoria Morning was meant to be different way before
  Cornell started working on it. Solo projects serve the purpose of
  letting the artists express themselves in ways they are unable to
  in their own bands. And considering this, Euphoria Morning is a
  huge success. That said, there are still some songs where the
  band behind Cornell churns out some rocking riffs and rhythms,
  such as "Flutter Girl" and especially "Pillow of Your Bones"
  during the chorus. The former starts out in an almost poppy
  fashion but quickly picks up a playful funk bass line and is
  finished off with a cool blues lead; whereas the latter is more
  straightforward, employing lots of acoustic and electric guitars
  as well as weird percussion work. The final song "Steel Rain" is
  also a number that alternates between decidedly heavier parts and
  more haunting, ominous moments. The ethnic drumming (great tabla
  rhythms) on this track is quite experimental given Cornell's
  music with Soundgarden and later on with Audioslave. "Follow My
  Way" and "When I'm Down" are the most moving songs, with the
  latter featuring a deft piano and organ melody beneath Cornell's
  heartfelt delivery. This is another song that embraces his love
  for bluesy guitar work and it also features some female backing
  harmonies during its pre-chorus. Similarly, the title track is a
  passionate piece where Cornell sings entirely a capella over
  acoustic guitars. There are no other instruments; Cornell plays
  his guitar and simply sings his heart out. A remix of the
  effect-laden "Mission" would later be included on the Mission
  Impossible 2 soundtrack while "Moonchild" became a minor hit with
  its eerie atmosphere along with the opening song "Can't Change
  Me", perhaps the most modern-sounding, upbeat song on the album.
  Despite being only three minutes though, its flow is majestic,
  borrowing harmonica, tambourine and shimmering keyboards that
  climax at the final second. My European copy of the album
  contains a very different version of the opening song, with
  French lyrics, accordion, mandolin, and female vocals backing
  Cornell. The song returns to its English chorus at one point, but
  the rest is all delivered in French and perhaps more engaging
  than the original version in some ways. Chris Cornell is one of
  the greatest voices in rock and this solo album is testimony to
  his greatness. When freed from any band restrictions, the man is
  capable of crafting some of the most moving and brutally honest
  songs ever.</Text>
  <Text category="music">I heard the first Beat LP (&amp;amp;quot;I
  Just Can't Stop It&amp;amp;quot;) in a small town record shop in
  1980 and instantly fell in love with this band's brand of
  ska/soul/rock. For some strange reason, I never bought
  &amp;amp;quot;Wha'ppen&amp;amp;quot; and never got familiar with
  it. I confess to reading some less than enthusiastic reviews and
  shying away. Of course, I did buy &amp;amp;quot;Special Beat
  Service&amp;amp;quot; and found it to be par excellent. So I
  ordered &amp;amp;quot;Wha'ppen&amp;amp;quot; a couple of months
  ago and it arrived a few weeks back and I've been wearing it out.
  Damn! How did I miss this? This is a great collection of snaky
  sweet, politically smart songs. &amp;amp;quot;Doors of Your
  Heart&amp;amp;quot;... I've loved that song for years... and
  &amp;amp;quot;Too Nice to Talk To&amp;amp;quot; has always been a
  favorite. But every other single song on this CD, including the
  bonus tracks, is outstanding. These songs are textural wonders.
  Great stinging guitar work and the incredible Saxa on his horn
  make this a stunning recording. I regret not discovering it
  sooner, but it sure is a nice find after-the-fact. Oh yeah... one
  more thing... I had the pleasure of meeting Dave Wakeling in
  Nashville this past summer and he's a very nice fellow who cares
  about the people that support him. If he comes to a venue near
  you, don't miss the show. You'll get your money's worth and more.
  Wear your dancin' shoes. He is truly one of the great talents of
  the 80's and continues to make significant music. He may be the
  most underrated recording artist of the past two decades. Buy
  this CD. You won't regret it. It sounds best in the early
  evening. I'm the Big Oh and I gotta go</Text>
  <Text category="music">I have seen Al Jarreau 20 times in concert
  (and recently saw Al and George perform at the Hollywood Bowl)
  and am a long-time fan from WAY BACK. There are a few Al CDs that
  you just play forwards and backwards (and back when they were
  cassettes, you wore out the tape) because they're just PERFECT.
  "Breakin' Away", "Jarreau" and "Heaven and Earth" come to mind.
  Well, add "Givin' It Up" to that list. If you're an old-school Al
  fan and you're wondering whether to buy this CD, BUY IT. It will
  live up to all of your Al expectations. There's a "Look the
  Rainbow" feel to it, there's a "Breakin' Away" feel to it,
  there's a "Jarreau" feel to it. There's even a "Glow" feel to it
  (when you think about tunes like "Milwaukee" and "Have You Seen
  the Child?"). Grassroots Al. It's got the production values of
  "Heaven and Earth" and "Tenderness". FABULOUS production,
  arrangements, gathering of talent. There is not one song on here
  that you will skip as you're listening to it driving to work or
  whatever. In fact, if you're throwing a party and want to
  instantly get people in a jazzy party mood, put on this CD
  because between everybody from Chris Botti to Jill Scott to a
  SOULFUL Paul McCartney, people will stop and say, "Wow, listen to
  Jill and George tearing up 'God Bless the Child.'" And "Is that
  Paul McCartney tearing up 'Bring It on Home to Me'?" [Yes, it
  is.] Meanwhile, Al and George are working their magic the entire
  time, and guests will say, "Listen to George right there." And,
  "Al is jamming right now." It's a conversation-stopper provided
  by the best thing that can stop a conversation at a party:
  fabulous music that people must comment on. Of course, that's
  where the conversation picks right back up, so you win either
  way. The blend is perfect: Just a touch of scatting, just a touch
  of voice-beat, with lots of fabulous jazzy vocals by both Al and
  George, tons of great music solos, and George playing a perfect
  guitar. If you're a George Benson fan, you will be THRILLED with
  this CD because George provides a fabulous through-line to every
  piece. He's ever-present with every wonderful thing he ever did
  on a guitar. He fronts many of the pieces, and he's not in any
  way relegated to "background guitarist." He IS the music in every
  piece, with few exceptions. As much as I love Al, this CD is
  MAGICAL because of the blend of George and Al. ONLY THESE TWO CAN
  PAIR UP TO MAKE THIS KIND OF CD. There IS NO OTHER TEAM who could
  have pulled this off. You need Al's voice and George's guitar.
  Period. In fact, I'm guessing much of the jazz music world is a
  tad jealous right now of how simply GENIUS this CD is, as in,
  "Dang. These two are GREAT together. Wow." Bottom line: This is a
  perfect blend of these two greats' talents. George takes care of
  the music, while Al provides the wide gamut of vocals he's an
  expert at (and that only he can provide). If you've been a
  long-time fan of either of these two, you won't be disappointed.
  It's not lopsided. And it's OLD-SCHOOL in every good way. My
  prediction: This CD will sweep the Grammys. If it doesn't, there
  is no justice. Like another reviewer on this page, I intend to
  buy this CD for about EIGHT people. It's just THAT perfect</Text>
  <Text category="music">Hey Bret is one of the most tallented song
  writers of our time! He will be in the rock n' roll hall of fame
  when he is done and his guitar playin' and singin' is very
  underrated! Buy this</Text>
  <Text category="music">I love this show so much!! IT just has so
  much passion and beauty and all the cast members sing so well!!
  Sutton Foster as Jo, was cast very well, its obvious she deserved
  that Tony nomination in 2005, and the sisters, even though they
  weren't the leads, they all had such great songs, especially
  Beth, whose song, "Some things are meant to be" always brings
  tears to my eyes,its just so touching. I would definitely
  recomend this CD to anyone who loves musical theatr</Text>
  <Text category="music">I saw these guys live in the Twin Cities
  last week. They opened for Keane and The Zutons. These guys were
  definitely the best part of the show. They had great energy and
  actually looked like they were having fun. To top it off, they
  sounded great and their songs were well written. Give these guys
  a shot, unless you hate Rock 'n' Roll!!</Text>
  <Text category="music">This CD is SOO cool!! I love all the
  songs! They are all good efforts. I especially like Mr. Coffee
  You Have gotta hear that song! Other than that this is a great
  CD!! buy it today!! You'll Enjoy i</Text>
  <Text category="music">Unlike other classical-crossover artists
  minus Emma Shapplin, I believe Sarah Brightman works for art, not
  for money, or fame, or show off. Like what she said in an
  interview, she sees music a a whole--music is to be enjoyed (and
  categorization should never get in the way). That's apparent from
  this very endearing album La Luna. I think this album is as a
  whole better than any song in it although my favourites are still
  the mystical Figlio Perduto, the dreamy Serenade/How Fair this
  Place, the gloomy Gloomy Sunday, and the sweet La Luna. I read
  what a reviewer said about how any other sopranos could sing
  better than Sarah on La Luna/Song to the Moon. I think that's not
  true, at all. Just because the singing isn't wagnerish, it
  doesn't mean it's easy or lacking in technique or whatever he
  said. I think it's easier to just sing full out operatic like,
  say, Renee Fleming than singing with so much passion and being
  lilting without losing any of the voice's qualities (laid back
  with 'THAT' voice at the beginning and successively powerful at
  the end). And, duh, she sings classical properly, ffs. And tell
  me a name of a soprano who could sing How Fair this Place with
  such grace, without sounding like a screeching steel can. I've
  also listened to many other versions of Gloomy Sunday. Billie's
  is weird. Sarah McLachlan's is out of context. Sinead o' Connors'
  is shabby although the intelligence behind the singing is fine.
  Only Sarah Brightman's and Bjork's versions are best for my ears.
  I have introduced her music (from Phantom of the Opera to Dive to
  Timeless to Harem) to many people, and apparently they enjoy them
  very much! There is this radio that's a favourite of us where
  Gloomy Sunday and Time To Say Goodbye are played as much as Bon
  Jovi's It's My Live and Sophie Ellis Bextor's Take Me Home and
  Offspring's Pretty Fly. They're good music and enjoyable. Albeit
  I also like many other sopranos. I like Lucia Popp's
  interpretation of Richard Strauss' lieders, Christa Ludwig's of
  Schubert's, Natalie Dessay, Kiri te Kanawa, etc. :</Text>
  <Text category="music">i'm a spanish fan of soul music of the
  90's. these days is almost impossible to find a good
  soul/r&amp;amp;b cd to purchase. In the 90's i had to buy about 2
  or 3 cds per week. Now, with all the rap &amp;amp; hip hop
  topping the charts,what kind of music could i purchase? LUTHER,
  ANITA, LALAH, SMOOTH JAZZ &amp;amp; maybe, some Joe's cd. AND OF
  COURSE, THIS TERRIFIC CD BY mr.BENSON. If you're a fan of good
  r&amp;amp;b music and you hate the hip hop music, buy this cd
  NOW!!!! You won't regret!</Text>
  <Text category="music">I just bought this on CD as it was on sale
  through the CD club. I have the original vinyl, but hadn't
  listened to it in years. This is one of the best works of music
  ever conceived, written and performed. It is absolutely timeless
  and each song impresses you more than the last. Put this one on
  repeat and let it play three or four times. It just keeps getting
  better. Stevie is an awesome talent and this may be his best.
  Don't forget how great music was in the 70's. This work is one of
  the major reasons for the resurgence of 70's music today by
  artists that weren't even born then. You can see quite clearly
  the artists that followed Stevie. Most recently Alicia Keys who
  would be the first to say his music is pure inspiration</Text>
  <Text category="music">I just refreshed my ears listening to
  "Riot" again! Getting to to hear 1/2 Full, which clocking in at
  just over 4 minutes, is sheer electric blues magic. The price of
  this album is worth this one rocker alone. It was nice to see it
  on "Easy Street" (along with Lukin' Excellent!)any way this
  number totally kicks! Definitely get this if you don't already
  own it.</Text>
  <Text category="music">This is my favorite jazz album of all
  time. Put simply, this was Miles Davis at his best. The notes on
  this album simply float, and yet it flows together better than
  anything I've ever heard. The composition is disorganized but in
  a way that it all makes complete sense. Don't let the thirty
  second clips fool you. I almost missed out on this because the
  clips are misleading. I took a chance on it, and it was the best
  gamble I've ever made. A must have for any jazz enthusiast</Text>
  <Text category="music">Some of the catchiest melodies and
  harmonies ever from Curt. Lots of cool instrumentation. Pete
  Anderson did a great job with the production. This hasn't left my
  CD player since I got it 4 days ago</Text>
  <Text category="music">Grew up on this group. Love them then and
  love them now. Own the &amp;amp;quot;Best of&amp;amp;quot;
  Collection but you can never compile the best on one CD. For
  those Winans fans you know what I'm talking about. These brothers
  are music genuises especially Marvin Winans. Like Stevie Wonder
  they were ahead of their time. My favorite song on this album
  shares the message of all times. &amp;amp;quot;Together We
  Stand&amp;amp;quot; opens up the eyes to all race,religion, and
  creed that its time to come together if we want to see a change
  in this world regardless of background. Entire album is great
  including the celebrity appearances such as Stevie Wonder, Teddy
  Riley, and Aaron Hall. I like the flavor the cameos add to this
  album. If you're into mid-tempo music this is the album to
  purchase</Text>
  <Text category="music">For those who have only heard the hits
  this is a fine addition for your collection. Bruce and the boys
  were young and completely up to the task of handing out the long
  jams you find here. The title sums up the overall feeling of the
  songs. There's a certain joy and a ton of fun to be had. Put this
  on one nice warm spring day and see if it doesn't lift your mood.
  Caution: must be listened to while drinking a cold domestic
  beer</Text>
  <Text category="music">I like every song but 1 on this CD.
  They're the same ones that're on the movie and if you don't like
  the movie, you probably wouldn't like the CD</Text>
  <Text category="music">John Michael Mongomery is back with a big
  bang. This album is one of the best to come out this year. It's
  better than that of Travis Tritt, Alan Jackson, and Kenny
  Chesney. The song I wanna be there is one of the most touching
  songs since Alan's Where Were you. He mixes the soulful ballads,
  with his country rockers, and sweet love songs. THis is vinatage
  JMM and should be bought by any true country music fan</Text>
  <Text category="music">Although the real roots lie with the black
  artists who inspired these guys, the PBBB is where the hippy
  generation,(this is a couple years pre-San Francisco, and before
  the Stones and Beatles began stretching their arrangements out on
  record),learned to JUST PLAY. Their next record was more
  representative of what they were actually doing live at time
  time, and is the single greatest influence on what became the San
  Francisco sound of the late 60's and early 70's, (REALLY long and
  experimental jamming), so this is in fact the &amp;amp;quot;roots
  of the roots of the roots&amp;amp;quot; of todays jam bands and
  guitar-heavy blues bands, mixed-race bands, and, for all
  practical purposes, the white-blues-man in todays' world</Text>
  <Text category="music">Ok, i just could not resist coming on here
  to review this. I've had this CD for about 4 years now and I
  STILL listen to quite a bit, proof right there that this CD is
  definetly a classic (in my book at least) Every single song on
  here is original, the guitar riffs are simply amazing, and the
  lyrics i can not even describe in words how much they hit home
  and how breathtaking they are. If your a Goo Goo Doll fan, and
  you still do not have this CD, i deeply encourge you to go buy it
  now! This is The is The Goos like you've never heard them before.
  The CD is pure genius, and in my opinion the best cd i've ever
  heard</Text>
  <Text category="music">This has been my first cd of Rod Stewart
  and I am very proud to have this cd,because worth every penny.
  This CD has class. Congratulations to the men behind. The duet
  with Cher "Bewitched, Bothered &amp;amp; Bewildered" is the best
  song.duet with Queen Latifah "As Time Goes By," I was astonish,
  She has a nice voice TOO!!. All songs are relaxings. Actually ,I
  listen this cd before to go bed</Text>
  <Text category="music">Actually haven't heard this CD, yet, I can
  still comment on part of it. I was the lucky guy who did the live
  recording at the X-Ray Cafe. Sold the masters to the band a
  couple years ago and just now got around to thinking, "I wonder
  if they ever did anything with those masters?" So, I was there at
  the show and can say that every ounce of energy that the band put
  out (which was considerable since this was the last show on their
  tour, but they knew the X-Ray was special and gave it their all)-
  It was all captured on these recordings. The machine was a Tascam
  688 that used standard cassette tapes for 8-channel recordings.
  Most all the mics were either Shure SM57/58, but there was also a
  high quality Shure stereo mic overhead that was mainly used for
  capturing the drum kit but also provided a nice stereo image of
  the stage. The X-Ray was perfect for this type of recording. The
  tiny PA was only used for the vocals, so, there was no competing
  with a PA blasting everything. I would place a SM-57 close to
  every amp. Had a nice specialtiy bass mic, too. Usually, 8
  channels was enough to catch everything, but, there were extra
  inputs where it was possible to stack multiple mics onto a single
  track if needed. Because of the overhead stereo catching the
  drums, this was rarely needed. With a full house, such as the
  night with The Gits, any reflecting waves were just soaked up by
  the body mass of the crowd, creating what turned out to be a very
  nice intimate recording space. There was split box on stage which
  fed all the mics to the X-Ray "business office" next door, which
  is where the Tascam was setup away from any real danger. All of
  which made it a fun gig to record in comfort and be able to also
  go over to the stage side and enjoy the show. Every once in a
  while, magic happened. D. Fletcher Portland, OR</Text>
  <Text category="music">It's fair to say that all orchestras are
  not created (or built) equally and these discs of phenomenal
  playing with the Berlin Philharmonic under the baton of Herbert
  von Karajan are simply some of the best classical recordings ever
  made. Analog sound was at its peak when these records were made
  in 1976 and 77 and DG has done an excellent job of remastering
  them for CD. But beyond that Karajan simply "gets" the
  composer--as another reviewer pointed out--and conducts with an
  intensity and passion he seldom showed in his other recordings
  and performances. I'm listening to these discs once more on a
  massive sound system with doubled speakers to handle the '70s
  Kenwood beast amplifier and love it more than ever. As a reviewer
  once said of a classic Szell/Cleveland performance of Beethoven's
  Third, this is a reading of "blinding virtuosity and strength."
  As a budget two disc set it is also, incredibly enough, cheaper
  than those old DG import records we bought (and scratched up) one
  by one in the seventies. As I've said before, when you listen to
  a disc like this you realize why you went nuts for this kind of
  music in the first place. Buy it, blast it, love it, get your
  Slavic ya yas out!!</Text>
  <Text category="music">This CD has tons of power, and soothing
  energy. It really shows off how well Part understands the human

  <Text category="music">I've been a Jim Brickman fan for a few
  years now. When I saw this CD came out, I could not resist
  getting it. It is absolutely amazing and fully worth it. When I
  first put it in my stereo, I had to sit there just to listen to
  the first few tracks without doing anything. That was how
  impressive they were. The title of the album is incredibly
  fitting. While my roommate is venting about the latest drama in
  her group of friends, I have this CD turned up in my own little
  corner to "Escape" from it all. I swear I could not have found
  anything more fitting to be listening to while trying to get away
  from real life for a bit. If you love Jim Brickman, or just like
  soft jazz, or piano music, this CD is a must have</Text>
  <Text category="music">"I have been a Brickman fan since the very
  first album. Much of his early songs were uplifting piano solos
  without much "electronic enhancement." Escape is a wonderful
  album full of songs you might find on his early albums. There are
  three excellent vocals on the CD that will please fans who favor
  his more recent work which tends to feature the vocalist over the
  piano. If you are a Brickman fan, this is a must have
  album.</Text>
  <Text category="music">This is a good compilation of AFI's songs
  over the 10+ years they've been together. It's easily worthy of
  10 stars. This CD allows newcomers to listen to the progress
  leading up to Sing The Sorrow, and to get more intimate with the
  band. I havn't purchased this album YET, because I already have
  all their albums, but plan on it. The new tracks are from the
  Answer That, and Very Proud Of Ya era. They've finally been
  released on CD. This is a cool little feature fo newcomers also.
  Anyway, buy this album only if you havn't heard any of AFIs music
  but want to give it a try</Text>
  <Text category="music">This guy is a freak of nature! Different
  but in the same vein as Illinoise. I loved it..No fillers to

  Highlights are: Avalanche Adlai Stevenson Saul Bellow The

  <Text category="music">I bought this recording along with Blood
  on the tracks recently and all I can say is "Doggonit" it don't
  get any better than this. They called Elvis the king but Bob
  Dylan must be the "Wizard". Who will tell us great stories when
  he is gone?</Text>
  <Text category="music">Having read some of the reviews here I
  just thought I should mention that for those who enjoy punk rock
  music rather than the sameness of most emo music these days they
  should definitely check out this band! While the singer (Conor
  Oberst) does have that emo voice so familiar to many other bands,
  he utilises it well and his conviction can be heard throughout
  (unlike a band like Taking Back Sunday) The music is uplifting
  without being soppy or sentimental, the lyrics are refreshingly
  different from most punk-politics band and don't come across as
  just the singer throwing a badly worded hissy fit. If you want to
  feel sorry for youself go listen to Bright Eyes, if you want to
  do something about it listen to Desaparecidos</Text>
  <Text category="music">Anyone who had access to a radio in the
  80's would know at least two songs by Missing Persons. Their fun
  music and amazing flare (Dale did have pink and white stiped hair
  and it looked great!) make this a good party album. I also have
  their album Color In Your Life and most of the songs are great.
  Just as an added note, Warren Cuccarullo is now a member of Duran
  Duran (my personal favorite band) and has been since he appeared
  on their Notorious album which was released in 1986!!</Text>
  <Text category="music">I was looking for a cd that I could listen
  to all of the time. Oh my God, I am breathless. I was brought to
  tears as they sang "Mama". My mother passed away in 2002 and I
  never got a chance to say thank you and this song said it all.
  All of Il Divo's songs have touched me in a way that no one else
  could. Thank you for touching my heart. I really recommend that
  you give this cd a chance. All of these other people on the board
  that gave it a low score, obviously need a hearing aid and a
  heart. Blessing</Text>
  <Text category="music">When I first purchase this album the first

  female groups they rank 5 stars in my book following such groups

  <Text category="music">This is a Great Classic Rock CD including
  some timeless songs. If you like "Summer Breeze" as much as I do
  and have not heard the remix of it yet, you are in for a pleasent
  suprise. A remix album came out in November of 2004 called "What
  Is Hip" and in my opinion is the best remix album of 70's music
  that I've ever heard. Their version of "Summer Breeze" is near
  perfect. A modernized, but not over the top version that manages
  to preserve the true melody of the song with out removing the
  original rhythm. The entire album is great too. I have this
  "Greatest Hits" and the "What Is Hip" CD and simply can't get
  enough. Here's a link to the CD. ENJOY. http://www.amazon.com --

  <Text category="music">Very different, very cool! An awesome CD
  that all ages in my house (from 13 to 68) really enjoy listening
  to</Text>
  <Text category="music">Ah, yes, it's Nirvana's "Nevermind" cd,
  released in 1991. I listen to all 80's pop-metal, or hair metal
  (Whitesnake, Winger, Van Halen, Y&amp;amp;T, Dokken) I could go
  on forever on 80's bands. (Of course there is Rick Springfield,
  and John Cougar Mellencamp). I am a true rocker here, I know all
  the true bands out there, I know everything about them. I have
  reasons for this. But here's the bottom line. Nirvana was a
  breakthough along with Soundgarden and Pearl Jam back in the
  early 90's. Millions of people bought those cds. And yes, there
  were hair bands still alive back then, like Poison, and
  Firehouse, etc. Firehouse and Poison had alot of success,
  eventhough it wasn't the 80's anymore. As I can see, alot of my
  fellow rockers don't really like Nirvana, or Pearl Jam, or
  Soundgarden. To be completely honest, I like their music, I just
  don't prefer the music, because I don't like the hard sound. I
  really like the glam-hair band style. People say: "Nirvana and
  those other grunge bands killed glam-metal". Yes, I agree that
  they killed the 80's hair bands, but it's not necessarly their
  fault. It's a mix between the bands, and the people listenting to
  the music. Because of grundge music, today's music is quite
  horrifying, with EMO and other types of music that would've been
  a nightmare back in those days. Nirvana has a great CD here, but
  I just don't prefer it. If you are a REAL rocker, you'll listen
  to all the types of music back then. Don't judge unless you have
  actually heard it, because you may actually like it. To all
  rockers- Don't listen to modern music. It's poisoning our people,
  and no one really understands the true meaning of "the guitar" in
  today's music. Most of you will understand what I mean, so listen
  to the classics. Classic rock, and hair bands forever, and even
  grunge. Keep the classic alive. ~The Sicilian Axe Ma</Text>
  <Text category="music">This is a fantastic album. The fact that 5
  star reviews are still being submitted over 10 years after its
  release (and they're not the beatles or u2 or anything) should
  speak volumes. I have played this CD countless times over the
  years and I am amazed that I am not sick of it. I am a pretty
  constant consumer of new music. Get this CD - you won't regret
  it! (PS I've never done an Amazon review before, but the fact
  that this has had only 22 motivated me). It is melodic, catchy,
  uplifting and cheeky - in short, a little piece of musical
  bliss.</Text>
  <Text category="music">This was the break through record for Pink
  Floyd that would place them in the super-league. The strength of
  the record lies in the song writing that is simple yet engaging
  and Dave Gilmore's guitar playing and voice is superb. Production
  wise this is well polished and the presence of the sax and
  backing vocalists just give it that little extra commercial
  potential. Overall the record works well as a whole yet I do feel
  'Money' seems out of place. The problem with records like this
  that it is too easy to enjoy and all the sharp ends are neatly
  filed off and well packaged for your consumption. Now don't get
  me wrong I think this is a magnificent record but is it really
  Pink Floyd's greatest album, I tend to think not. Is it the
  greatest record of all time? Most certainly not. Because a
  records sells 35 million copies does not make it automatically
  great. Because everybody and their grandmother thinks it's great,
  does not necessarily make it great. The problem with this record
  is that it sounds of its time, not that that's a bad thing, its
  just that it does not transcend time. The real indication of a
  great record is how many people it inspires to make records that
  sound like it. I can't think of many records that sound like this
  without sounding retrogressive. Some records released at the same
  time: Can's "Future Days"(1973); Nue!'s "2"(1973); King Crimson's
  "Larks' Tongues In Aspic"(1973); Robert Wyatt's "Rock
  Bottom"(1974); Tangerine Dream's "Phaedra"(1974) are by far more
  influential and enduring than Dark Side. If you don't own Dark
  Side then buy it because it is a very good record and deserves
  its five stars, but make sure you buy 'Piper at the Gates of
  Dawn' also. 'Piper' is Floyds greatest, most influential and
  definitely one of the greatest of all time. Besides, how many
  people who think 'Dark Side' is Floyd's best have actually heard
  'Piper'.</Text>
  <Text category="music">This was the first Punk-O-Rama CD I
  listened to, and boy I was not dissapointed. Most of the songs on
  this CD are the type of punk I would listen to, Quite fast and
  energetic. The best song on the CD has to be either NOFX - Bath
  of Least Resistance (NOFX being the greatest punk band of all
  time, of course), or Beatsteaks - Let me in. I heard the
  Beatsteaks for the first time on this CD and there absolutely
  bloody excellent. Obviously, The Cd is made complete with songs
  from the Descendents, Pulley, Pennywise, Dropkick Murphy's. The
  only let down on this CD is Noise Conspiracy, there song on this
  CD, well plainly sucks i'm sorry to say. But overall this CD is
  one hell of a good listen if your into punk. That's all, oh yeah,
  buy it! by</Text>
  <Text category="music">Neil Young's latest release has some very
  clever and interesting songs. They are very political so unless
  you are a completest who likes Neil Young, if you agree with
  President Bush, this album will be a turn-off. For the
  politically neutral or those who agree with Neil Young this is a
  good album. Maybe this is not Neil Young's best but it still is a
  good album</Text>
  <Text category="music">Gun's &amp;amp; Roses came out in the nick
  of time. Record companies were mass producing cookie cutter bands
  and they all sound the same. G&amp;amp;R made their debut on the
  music scene in 87 but didn't get big until almost late 88 early
  89. Appitite is a true masterpiece. Welcome to the Jungle, It's
  So Easy, Mr. Brownstone, My Michelle....The list goes on and on.
  Put it in turn it up to 10 and Rock On! The they made a mistake.
  they realeased an albums worth of great songs on 2 albums. So
  instead of another masterpiece they wound up with 2 ok albums.
  Then they vanished. Anyone who is a fan of the music but couldn't
  care less about Axl should pick up Velvet Revolver with Slash and
  Scott Wieland from Stone Temple Pilots</Text>
  <Text category="music">Being a professional dancer as well as a

  this as &amp;amp;quot;one of the best&amp;amp;quot;. The dancers

  (from classical to rock) is highly deversified. CAN'T WAIT TILL I

  <Text category="music">Digressing from their first 2 albums,
  Transmutation(5 stars)and Sacrifist( 5 stars), Praxis unleashes
  Metatron. Trimmed down to a 3 piece with Laswell, Bucket and
  Brain covering all bases, Metatron lacks Bootsy's space bass,
  Yamatsuka Eye's agonizing screams or John Zorn's out of tune
  saxamaphoning, but it still rocks. track 1 is a laid back
  acoustic # and is absolutly beautiful. The album lacks the speed
  of some of Sacrifist's songs but makes up in phat grooves. Half
  of the Collection cd(again 5 stars) is from this album, but with
  nothing from Transmutation, hmmm. Instead of going further Ill'
  say this.... Get THIs Album at alll costs. Burn copies for
  friends and spread the gospel according to Praxis</Text>
  <Text category="music">I have to admit that, at first listening,
  I found some aspects of Ms.Belle's interpretations of these
  pieces disorienting. However, as I listened to these covers
  repeatedly, I can now say that I understand better what the
  vocalist is after. Not that I always agree with her and with
  George Duke,the arranger/producer, but I agree with their choices
  and their totally new project and enjoy having had my horizons
  broadened. Ms.Belle has immense talent, superb technique, and a
  clear idea of each piece, and she delivers the goods without
  faltering or compromise. I admire that a lot in a performer. Her
  choices ask us for a reaction and we are free to accept or reject
  what she has offered us. When I first heard these renditions, I
  was quite stand-offish, but over time I have come to appreciate
  them more and more - almost to the point of addiction - and am
  grateful to Regina and George for their strength of conviction as
  well as their superior musicianship.They do NOT want us to listen
  in a passive way, they are waiting for our reaction..and God,
  this is really so,so good....That's the true spirit in which an
  album should be recorded. I'd encourage you to get this album
  because it is about strong, powerful and personal interpretations
  of some great jazz standards by Regina. You may love everything
  about it, or you may reject aspects of her interpretations. But
  in any case you will not remain indifferent; you will be enriched
  by hearing these pieces in a clear and beautifully personal way.
  That is an important aspect of why I love this imaginative,
  innovative quality music and why this recording is invaluable.
  And it cannot be said enough that her backing band is incredible,
  giving this album the necessary push to take it over the edge. It
  is a success because it skilfully avoids being categorized.
  Regina has had the courage to break out of the traditional mould
  and make a successful cross-over, which some purists may not
  approve of... Only time will tell....</Text>
  <Text category="music">Okay, take everything that you know about
  John Squire. Strip away the amazing Stone Roses first album, the
  not so amazing follow up, the nice brit pop of his work with the
  Seahorses and picture this as a solo album from a new artist and
  I honestly think that peoples thoughts on this album would change
  drastically. They would realize that every track on it is a
  winner and that the guitar work is amazing and beautiful, the
  vocals might be grating at first (Think Robert Forster (The
  Go-betweens) circa Before Hollywood) but that upon repeated
  listens grows on you and you eventually end up loving. What you
  expect going into an album has alot to do with how much you like
  or dislike it and this album is no exception. People should
  listen to it for what it is and not for what John Squire
  was...John Squire is an established song writer who has moved
  beyond what he used to do (who hasn't moved on in 13 years? minus
  Robert Smith of course!) and now writes beautiful pop
  songs...John Squire has grown up just like his original audience
  has and this solo album is the perfect proof of that</Text>
  <Text category="music">This CD is supberb!! Absolutely fabulous.
  I received it timely and have enjoyed listening to it over and
  over again. All my deslings with Amazon thusfar have been
  outstanding. Thanks, Amazon Laura Rig</Text>
  <Text category="music">This was not a waste of Brad's time or
  mine. Good job!</Text>
  <Text category="music">Tim McGraw does it again. It is a great
  album with some really great songs. A must have</Text>
  <Text category="music">Wow! There's sooooo... much to like in
  this album it's amazing. The music is mostly upbeat &amp;amp;
  very catchy--making you want to (&amp;amp; will if no one's
  around) sing along. The lyrics are fine, meaningful, &amp;amp;
  personally touching--about life which is getting faster &amp;amp;
  faster in the contemporary world, while people are still people
  with hopes, feelings, needs, desires, &amp;amp; all the rest of
  what makes people human. The lead singer, Jennifer Nettles is
  powerful yet gifted with a sweet voice (though a bit twangy in
  style). She grabs you quickly for a wild ride--immersing the
  listener in the musical story she's telling. I bought the CD
  based on hearing Baby Girl &amp;amp; Something More (on the TV
  show Vegas of all place). Then I heard Sugarland on the CMA
  show--winning awards as they so deserve. The range &amp;amp;
  variety of the songs on the album are good too--from sweet
  &amp;amp; poignant ballads to wild &amp;amp; spicy soaring.
  Virtually all of the songs are well worth listening to &amp;amp;
  the majority could become successful singles. Yes, the style is
  their own mixture of influences--the 3 artists come from
  different musical backgrounds, which makes their wonderful
  blending are the more impressive. And, the trio wrote all the
  songs on the CD--with Hall the primary author (solo writer on one
  of them). How many trios are there with 2 women &amp;amp; 1 man?
  I wonder if they are unique? Well, they are unique even if not in
  that respect--how many bands include a mandolin?. Of course,
  country purists may not be happy with them, but the vast majority
  of listeners ARE. This has become one of my favorite albums, at
  the speed of sound. IMHO, it's terrific</Text>
  <Text category="music">This is my all time favourite Jacksons
  album. This album, along with `Mama can't buy you love' and
  anything by Donna Summer were hogging the airwaves during my
  first visit to the States as a kid. Comprising mainly Jackson
  compositions (and production), it showed a more mature and funky
  side of the group, and was far more consistent than their hit
  filled but patchy Motown works. Filled with their trademark
  smooth harmonies, lots of horns and Michael's distinctive vocals,
  the album hit #11 on the billboard album charts (#3 R&amp;amp;B),
  was certified platinum and had a smash hit single in `Shake your
  body (down to the ground)' #7 pop. `Blame it on the boogie'
  opened the album in style, a funky upbeat disco tune that one
  couldn't keep still while it played. Other dancefloor anthems are
  the horn laden `Things I do for you', the frenetic `All night
  dancin'', and the shimmery `Shake your body' with its distinctive
  riff, which hinted at future MJ songs like `Don't stop till you
  get enough' and `Workin' day and night'. For me however, the
  songs that really did it for me were the ballads. `Push me away'
  is a lush sun kissed ballad featuring a passionate vocal delivery
  from Michael, alternating from full voice to falsetto with ease.
  Great horns! Title track `Destiny' has an acoustic guitar intro
  which leads into an amazing ballad where Michael declares `if
  it's the rich life I don't want it/happiness aint always material
  things'. Great backing harmonies too. `Bless his soul' is simply
  stunning! Featuring pensive lyrics about trying to do what's
  right, but never seeming to please anyone. `You just can't please
  the world and yourself' sings Jackie. This song starts off tender
  with congas, fleeting horns and strings which after the second
  chorus builds to a superb climax of `the life you're living is
  dangerous' and a fab outro of `hey, ha ha ha'. Then comes the
  final track and my favourite. The dramatic `That's what you get
  for being polite'. A thumping piano leads to horns and sweeping
  strings, and then Michael tells us the sad tale of some lonely
  guy named Jack who wants to be what he is not and would do
  anything for love. Dazzling instrumentation, a stellar vocal
  performance from Michael, The cover art was a painting depicting
  the group with their huge afros, and the original vinyl release
  folded open like a book with individual shots of the brothers.
  One of my favourite childhood albums, one of my all time
  favourite albums, and a classic!</Text>
  <Text category="music">I'll have to accept that even tough I'm
  not a great fan of this band they have impressed me with this new
  release, the lyrics are in some cases very deep and in songs like
  evil angel they can touch you right there. For me the band has
  progressed a lot and you can tell that in this album, it's very
  melodic and more mature. Also the acoustic version of "the diary
  of jane" is amazing. I personally recommend the songs "breath",
  "evil angel" and my favorite "dance with the devil"</Text>
  <Text category="music">A friend of mine gave me this cd about a
  year ago, I listened to a few minutes of it and was like "What is
  this crap?" and I shelved it for a couple months. I then picked
  it back up and gave it another listen. To my surprise it was
  really catchy to me. The music (and lyrics) are simple, but thats
  what I like about them. Theyre simple! This is a great
  college-rock cd. I plan on checking out more Teenage Fanclub, and
  I suggest you do the same. Notable tracks are Sidewinder, What
  You Do To Me, and Is This Music?</Text>
  <Text category="music">I recently purchased this cd again. I once
  owned it on cassette. Keith is a real smooth old school type
  singer and his music and sound has sustained very well since it
  was released in the early 90's. If you are building an old school
  collection with great singers this is a good one to have. It's
  great for romance or with that special lady. Jaye Price

  <Text category="music">Recorded 2001 - 2002. It has become all
  too common that few are taken to task for saying or doing stupid
  things. What's worse is that no one seems to care. This is the
  kind of thing that pisses Lewis Black off. The angrier he gets
  the funnier he is. I first came to appreciate Mr. Black on the
  Comedy Central's "Daily Show." I always felt that there should
  have been more time devoted to Lewis Black. I wanted more - I
  needed more - I had to have more! So I went to my "mental health
  club," Amazon.com and bought every title available. The End of
  the Universe, Rules of Engagement and Luther Burbank Preforming
  Arts Center Blues - ( I had already purchased the White Album)
  Which one is the best? ALL OF THEM! As I write this review - I
  realize that I still want more - so I am buying the DVD's. There
  is nothing dated about this material. In 2006 it is just as - if
  not funnier than when first released. Please Lewis keep recording
  it still is not enough! casl</Text>
  <Text category="music">This is my favorite Bob Dylan album. The
  album begins and ends with two of the greatest songs ever, Like a
  Rolling Stone and my favorite Desolation Row. Sandwiched in
  between are some fantastic songs. The album is filled with
  incredible lyrics,wonderful music, and a mean harmonica. If you
  want to know why Bob Dylan is a legend buy this album</Text>
  <Text category="music">It's hard to believe this music is more
  than a quarter century old now. I think it would recieve the same
  kind of accolades if had come out yesterday. But it didn't. It
  came out in the summer of 1979. It was the summer before my
  sophomore year in college, my first summer away from home. For at
  least a week, anytime it was my turn to put something on the
  turntable, I'd select side 1 of "Rust Never Sleeps." It took me
  at least that long to flip the darn thing over. And then, when I
  did, for the next week, anytime it was my turn to put something
  on the turntable, I'd select Side 2 of "Rust Never Sleeps." My
  flatmates never complained. Oddly, the songs I see getting the
  most grief in the reviews here are my faves. You don't really
  want to do without the swooping lead guitar, contagious
  handclaps, and hysterically funny yet politically cutting chorus
  of "Welfare Mothers," now, do you really? As for "Sedan
  Delivery," I have only the vaguest clue of what it's about, but
  it's sure a scorcher (and it's still hard to find a job).
  Allright, maybe we don't need two versions of "Hey Hey, My My,"
  but which one would you delete? As far as I'm concerned, there's
  only one song here that hasn't withstood the test of time: "Sail
  Away," which is innocuously pretty, but lacks the bark and bite
  of even the other acoustic stuff. "Trasher" and "Pocahontas" are
  both beautiful and mean in just the right amounts and places.
  Poor Marlon, poor CSN. Do I wax nostalgiac? Perhaps, but not
  overly so. This remains essential Neil, which is to say as
  essential as rock 'n roll gets. It still sounds fresh and
  relevant. And fun. Did I mention fun? In fact, I'm gonna go plunk
  it on right now, maybe take a breather between "Sail Away" and
  "Powderfinger" to relive the LP experience. You should
  too.</Text>
  <Text category="music">All I have to say is great album</Text>
  <Text category="music">A quality album from Richard. Long time
  fans will not be disappointed. It will win over quite a few new
  fans as well with it great guitars and snappy lyrics</Text>
  <Text category="music">This CD is great. It is a must have.
  Picture yourself in the wild or on a lake in a boat and a
  thunderstorm comes rolling in slowly. You hear the rain, the
  thunder in the distance, you sense the storm getting closer. The
  storm is over head, loud piercing thunder claps and you duck for
  cover. The thunderstorm slowly moves out but the rain is a
  constant presents. The thunder rolls on but the wild life moves
  in, bullfrogs, owls in the distance, all the animals are alive
  now. This cd is all in one, the real deal. It is not all thunder.
  I love it. I also bought Thunderstorm [Rykodisc]; this was a
  waste of money. To me, in my opinion it sounds like the storm
  just knocked the cable out, static and more static.</Text>
  <Text category="music">I purchased this CD during the lowest time
  of my life emotionally. Every track brought solace and comfort
  beyond belief, especially the title track, Deep Peace. I would
  listen to it over and over, bathing in the lush healing sounds.
  Each element, from the perfectly balanced vocals to the simple
  piano and violin motifs, is seemingly structured at a spiritual
  level. This is more than ambient music, it's true music
  therapy.</Text>

  <Text category="music">The Edward Scissorhands score will always
  be one of my absolute favorite movie scores. I truly believe this
  is Danny Elfman's best score and believe me, he's done some great
  scores! The music is so moving. The childrens chorus mixed with
  the soft bells and strings were absolutely perfect for this
  sweet, beautiful film. Even people who haven't seen this film
  have probably heard the music from it since it is used in so many
  film previews and commercials. A must-have for any Danny Elfman
  and/or Tim Burton fan</Text>
  <Text category="music">Jodeci's Forever My Lady has a problem
  that most nineties R&amp;amp;B releases had at that time, if the
  fast songs were tight then the slow songs suck and vice versa.
  Jodeci's first CD had some of the finest slow songs to come off
  of one CD in 1991. Stay, Forever My Lady, Come &amp;amp; Talk To
  Me, U&amp;amp;I,and I'm Still Waiting rank with the best but
  every single fast is hot trash</Text>
  <Text category="music">This book helps toddlers put into context
  how they fit into the animal kingdom, and the natural things all

  a day care center and got a very positive reaction</Text>
  <Text category="music">Goth meets Cabaret, or rather Gothic music
  influenced by Cabaret. Thats the best way to describe this
  wonderful little release by Projekt. The eleven tracks here
  provide an introduction to the "dark cabaret" scene, and do so
  quite well. The first song, Coin-Operated Boy by the Dresden
  Dolls, is a great start, and the CD continues onward to devious
  Evil Night Together by Jill Tracy (which sets up a wonderful film
  noir mood) and on to the darker, electronic dance number Cabaret
  Fortune Teller by Audra, to a remix of Knock Three Times on My
  Coffin by Projekt veterans Black Tape for a Blue Girl. Along the
  way numerous other bands are covered. Sam Rosenthal's side
  project Revue Noir makes their debut on this CD, with husky
  feminine vocals provided by Nicki Jaine, who also has a solo song
  (Pretty Faces) on the CD as well. Personally, I LOVED Revue Noir
  and find Nicki Jaine's voice to be quite alluring, but I also
  know some BTfaBG fans who dislike her vocals so you've been
  warned. But all in all, I think anyone with a task for the dark
  should check out this CD. At the very least, its a cheap and
  decent introduction to a whole new style, and thats always a good
  thing</Text>
  <Text category="music">This is an amazing, beautiful album.
  Probably a little more difficult to get into than Streethawk, but
  after about the 4th or 5th listen, I found it more rewarding. The
  music is very dense, and the lyrics are beautifully poetic (it
  helps that Dan Bejar has chosen to include a lyric sheet in the
  cover this time). A great album for any fan of intelligent
  independent music</Text>
  <Text category="music">(In reference to another review) - The
  symbol on the cover of Still is the Factory Records logo, Joy
  Division's record label. Since I'm in the area.... I've owned
  this album for about 15 years and it still sounds, in parts, as
  solid as anything Joy Division ever did. Some of the live stuff
  is so-so but studio tracks like The Kill, Dead Souls, Exercise
  One, They Walked In Line and Something Must Break are damn near
  worth the price of admission alone. If you already like Joy
  Division, thereby showing good taste, this is a great album. If
  you find yourself slowly descending beneath the black cloud of
  depression, Unknown Pleasures should fit. If you have been there
  and find yourself wanting out, Closer is the soundtrack. This
  album is more varied in mood, for established fans and safer for
  household pets</Text>
  <Text category="music">I love this soundtrack! It stands alone as
  beautiful, haunting, alluring, and innocent--just as Griet
  herself was in the film. Desplat perfectly captured the spirit of
  the story, enhanced and deepened a plot that was less than
  stellar. Scarlett Johanssen's acting is superb, as well as Essie
  Davis and Colin Firth. The story, though, was a bit tired--pretty
  housemaid/jealous wife/do-nothing husband. Its portrayal of
  Vermeer and his wife was a disservice to the real people, even
  though it is a fictionalized account. The two best tracks on this
  album are 'Griet's Theme' and 'Colours in the Clouds'. While I'm
  not keen on seeing the film again, this soundtrack is a treasure.
  It's a real work of art, second only to Vermeer's work</Text>
  <Text category="music">This is The Jacksons second album for epic
  and producers Gamble and Huff. It would be their last with Gamble
  and Huff but together they made a great album that doesnt get the
  play it should. Music's Takin Over, Different Kind of Lady and Do
  What You Wanna are great, catchy dance tracks. The real greatness
  here lies in the ballads where Michael's voice is in peak form.
  Even Though You're Gone and Find Me A Girl are classic ballads.
  So good, I feel that Find Me A Girl is probably the best Michael
  Jackson song you've never heard. This is probably Michael
  Jackson's most overlooked album and its one of his best! The
  Jacksons all sing together great and you can see why Destiny and
  Triumph were such big hits after this one was recorded. Overall,
  great ballads, catchy feel good dance tracks, and Michael Jackson
  singing his heart out. Get this, you will not be
  dissaponted</Text>
  <Text category="music">Hayley Westenra, at only 18 years old, is
  an enchanting voice we should be hearing from for many years to
  come. This is an uplifting and at times, spiritual album that
  shows shades of greatness. Throughout, Westenra's voice is
  captivating, though the musical scores are at times, sub-par and
  do not equal the vocal talent. There was an advertising tag on
  this CD that stated "The female Josh Grobin", but I think a more
  accurate sentiment would be "a young Sarah Brightman". ODYSSEY is
  a fine mix of spiritual and operatic tunes, all of which match up
  well with Westenra's abilities. Bocelli fans will also appreciate
  the duet, Dell Amore Non Si Sa. They pair up for that one song,
  but the rest is all Westenra. This is smooth, soothing and easy
  listening. If you like Brightman, you will truly appreciate the
  voice of Westenra.</Text>
  <Text category="music">In Boyz II Men's sophomore album, II, they
  make attempts to create their own identities with writing and
  producing this time around escaping producer Dallas Austin and
  founder Michael Bivins. This LP begins with the deepest of
  gratitude on "Thank You" produced by the group and Dallas Austin.
  Both "All Around The World" and "U Know" are mid-tempo tracks
  with a hip-hop flavor to them, but neither of the two is
  strikingly memorable or highlights. One thing they do is provide
  another angle for Boyz II Men. For a more relaxing environment,
  "Vibin'" has a rather simple instrumentation, lyrics and vocals.
  "I Sit Away" is a hidden gem with a mid-tempo flow with soothing
  lyrics written by Tony Rich and production by veteran L.A. Reid
  and Tony Rich. Stepping into a more modern jazz feel "Jezzebel"
  strengthen the groups range and abilities as the album is nearing
  a completed overall goal. Over a piano solo, Boyz II Men
  harmonize on "Khilil (Interlude)" to shift the gears down to
  their overpowering abilities to formulate ballads that begins
  with "Trying Times" written and produced by Wanya Morris, Tim
  Kelley &amp;amp; Bob Robinson. Hit maker Babyface lends a hand on
  two of the thirteen track album with smash singles and highlights
  "I'll Make Love To You" and "Water Runs Dry". Heavyweights Jimmy
  Jam &amp;amp; Terry Lewis add a touch of love and mood setting
  material on "On Bended Knee". "50 Candles" drives this album to
  epic proportions with its thriving bass and lyrical content
  "...feels like one of those nights..." They show and prove why
  for their time there are no other male groups that can compare to
  their beautiful harmony and range as on "Yesterday" they perform
  accapella. If real talent that you seek, members Shawn, Michael,
  Nathan and Wanya has uncompromising talent for any age, era, or
  time that you can enjoy for long time.</Text>
  <Text category="music">to set the record straight, rodney
  'darkchild' jerkins produced ONE song on this album, and that is
  'he said'. that said, producer waryn 'baby dubb' campbell [also
  husband of erika, younger of the duo] did a great job on this
  album. not at all to say that the ladies' singing hasn't always
  been phenomenal. the highlights of this album include the
  aforementioned darkchild song, a guest apperance by fred hammond
  on 'this love' [their appearance on his album, speak those
  things' is duly noted], an impressively done cover of stevie
  wonder's 'you will know', and a cover of walter hawkins' 'thank
  you'. yes, that is the original sampled at the end of the song.
  every album that mary mary has released to this day [yes, all two
  of them] has proven that gospel music can be musically current--
  impressive-- and still within taste. that's what happens when you
  have the best on your team... baby dubb, while being mary mary's
  resident producer can also be found on kierra sheard's 'let go',
  'sweetest thing', 'all i am', fred hammond's albums 'speak those
  things' and 'somethin' 'bout love' and countless other records.
  the downside: the last two songs. they're of forgettable quality.
  while happy, forgettable. overall, this album is an
  essential</Text>
  <Text category="music">If you think yer gonna puke everytime you

  Real Deal. I don't mean real country or real rock - this is a
  hybrid - I mean he's making music that is honest and down to
  earth. A flash in the pan, he's not. He's going to be around for

  <Text category="music">Tom DeLonge is at it again with a new band
  and a new album. Even with being accompanied by the lead
  guitarist from Boxcar Racer, Angels and Airwaves managed to have
  a completely different sound. They dropped the more punk rock
  tone of Boxcar Racer in favor of an emo-alternative style of
  rock. The first released single "The Adventure" is quite
  enjoyable and even though I haven't checked too deeply into it, I
  think it's the theme song for NBC's Studio 60. Besides, how can
  you go wrong with an album that's gone double platinum in the UK
  and gold in Canada</Text>
  <Text category="music">After watching the movie walk the line, I
  wanted to hear more of Johnny Cash. All these years(35 of them) I
  always thought he was just a slow folk singer. His music is
  non-stop foot tapping soul grabbing stuff. He toured with Elvis
  Presely and Jerry Lee Lewis. He inspired musicians like Bob
  Dylan. I am so glad I bought this CD. It's the best purchase I
  made all year.</Text>
  <Text category="music">Well it's not quite as good as Rising
  which is the best album ever but it's still amazing. 1.Man On The
  Silver Mountain- 10/10 This track is a classic and is still
  played at every Dio concert and Ritchie Blackmore still performed
  it at every Rainbow concert until Rainbow disbanded in 1997 but
  anyway this may be Ritchie Blackmore's strongest riff ever! and
  Dio's vocal performance is excellent. Anyway it's a great fantasy
  song by Dio and Blackmore and still got radio play so it appeals
  to everyone. 2.Self Portrait- 10/10 Excellent dark song by the
  band which fits Dio's voice perfectly another classic! 3.Black
  Sheep Of The Family- 8/10 Good song but not a Rainbow song it's a
  cover and that's a shame because I would have loved to hear Dio's
  brilliant lyrics another original song but anyway still a good
  listen 4.Catch The Rainbow- 10/10 Another classic from this album
  as Dio shows how well he can sing ballads as well as epics and
  rockers. Blackmore has a solo full of feeling and this was
  performed at every Rainbow concert until Dio left the band.
  5.Snake Charmer- 10/10 Another song that takes place in the
  middle ages which is Rainbow's trademark. Anyway this song is
  very underrated and should have been a classic. Dio has brilliant
  lyrics and vocals as usual and it's no suprise that Blackmore
  supplied excellent solos and riffs for this one 6.Temple OF The
  King- 10/10 Here is the best ballad of all time!!! Ronnie's
  vocals are perfect for this song and his lyrics are amazing too.
  Blackmore throws togethor and a great arrangemant and solo aswell
  to make this maybe the best track on the album. 7.If You Don't
  Like Rock N Roll- 8/10 Kind of cheesy lyrics but a good track and
  it sounds more like an Elf track. 8.Sixteenth Century
  Greensleeves- 10/10 Great song! A real classic as Dio puts
  togethor another great fantasy song. Blackmore's riffs is
  brilliant and his solo is full of bends and shredding. 9.Still
  I'm Sad- 10/10 Well the version with vocals is much than this
  instrumental version but this version is brilliant too. The live
  version off On Stage however with Dio's vocals blow it away. I
  still wonder why there weren't any vocals on this. The band is
  Ronnie James Dio- vocals Ritchie Blackmore- Guitar Gary Driscoll-
  Drums Mickey Lee Soule- Keyboards, Piano, Mellatron Craig Guber-
  Bass 2</Text>
  <Text category="music">I like the main voice(s) and I like the
  music, but the voices are over powered by the music. If they
  turned up the voices a bit I think this would be a great album.
  This album does not sound like other albums I have so I'm not
  sure what to compare it to.</Text>
  <Text category="music">The title gets it right - this is a very
  fun album. There are a lot of great songs on here. Infectious
  lyrics and music - it still surprises me that Matthew Sweet isn't
  more popular than he is. One other thing...it's a sin that "We're
  The Same" wasn't a bigger hit than it was. Truly a great
  song</Text>
  <Text category="music">This CD is truly a classic and one of my
  all-time favorites. Love it</Text>
  <Text category="music">This CD is perfect for driving. The
  Downtempo/Beat Driven Ambient feel and overall togetherness of
  this CD is a perfect choice for easy electronic listening.
  Overall very pleased with Mr. Schnauss' contribution to the
  genre. Highly reccomende</Text>
  <Text category="music">Rare are the electronic albums that are so
  consistantly inspired. Melodies are beautifully simple and
  soothing, sounds are particularly well crafted. A great album.
  The drum box could be a bit more discreet though</Text>
  <Text category="music">Every listen I get more into this CD. Many
  catchy songs. I now need to buy more of Donald's solo stuff.
  Great music</Text>
  <Text category="music">I just saw this woman live and she's
  amazing!!!! The songs come alive when you hear them! It's hard to
  put into words the state that her music and lyrics put you in.
  But trust me it's a good place! Please check her music out if
  you're into heartfelt music</Text>
  <Text category="music">What can I say that most of the people
  reviewing this cd haven't already said. Arthur is OUTRAGEOUSLY
  talented. It's almost shocking. The depth of songwriting and
  production values are so intense. It's extremely well recorded
  and mixed music. Anyone into audio manipulation should just buy
  all of his albums right now. "Stumble and Pain" is probably my
  favourite track. The sinister tone of it and the synth effects
  are just superb. As with all Arthur albums the vocals are dense,
  layered, and its something he's obviously worked on for a long
  time and it really pays off on this album! Anyone new to him
  should buy this immediatly and buy redemption's son straight
  after that. WHAT A MUSICIAN</Text>
  <Text category="music">First up I give this album a 4.5/5 for the
  fac that it has REAL hiphop beats and good lyrics. Real hiphop,
  they stayed true to the sound. I just didnt give it a 5 since im
  not the biggest TCQ fan and of that style. But all these emcees
  spit hott lyrics in this album. Tracks like "Keep It Movin", "Hot
  Sex" have ill beats. This album does have a real jazzy sound to
  it, which im not the biggest fan of, but its more of a unique
  style, and they deserve props for trying new styles. So overall
  this is a really good album, and worth getting. My Top 5 Songs
  1.Buggin Out 2.Hot Sex 3.Oh My God 4.Luck Of Lucien 5.Keep It
  Movi</Text>
  <Text category="music">Try to name some of the greatest debut
  rock albums. Let me give you one ground rule though: It has to be
  from a band that put out at least five albums (so no Stone Roses,
  Sugar, Verve or Jane's Addiction, e.g.). Here are some of mine,
  off the top of my head: Led Zeppelin I, In the Court of the
  Crimson King, Days of Future Passed, The Doors, Boy (U2), C.S.N.,
  Can't Buy a Thrill (Steely Dan), Ten (Pearl Jam), Murmur (REM).
  I'm sure there are a number of others that I'm forgetting. Oh
  yeah, one more: the incredible "Ferment," by Catherine Wheel. The
  harmonies and swirling lush guitar sounds created by Rob
  Dickinson and Brian Futter, the compelling rhythms generated by
  Dave Hawes (Bass) and Neil Sims (Percussion), it just all works,
  and is comparable in every way to the extraordinary "Nowhere" by
  Ride (not quite as great as "Loveless" by My Bloody Valentine).
  Unfortunately, C.W. never quite matched the power of "Ferment"
  with their subsequent releases. The best song on the album is
  "Black Metallic" ("it's the color of her skin/ her skin is black
  metallic") which soars up to the sky, floats in the wind, lands,
  and soars again. Clearly, "Black Metallic" clocks in as the
  band's "Stairway to Heaven." The second best song on "Ferment" is
  . . . well that's where it gets tricky, and demostrates how great
  this album is. There are no weak or even average songs, and I
  could see where anyone of the others can be considered as a
  runner up to "Black Metallic." Put a gun to my head and I would
  have to go with "Shallow" or maybe "Tumbledown" or perhaps, if
  I'm in a more pop oriented mood, the danceable "I Want to Touch
  You." Although, last night, as I was listening to the album in
  preparation for this review, I thought of how strongly it closes
  with the trio ""Bill and Ben," "Salt" and the uplifting "Balloon"
  ("ba-ba-ba-ba-balloon"). A wonderful album. Perhaps not in my top
  ten, but definitely in my top twenty (tied with the
  aforementioned "Nowhere")</Text>
  <Text category="music">I bought a copy for a friend recently and
  she said "His music sounds so fresh and it's so singable. The
  lyrics are meaty, too, not just fluffy pop. I'm kind of obsessing
  over this music right now--which is fun! Thanks so much... I'd
  like to see him in concert sometime." I had this album for a year
  before I really got into it, since it takes a couple of listens
  to really appreciate. At first listen I really liked We'll Do It
  All Again, and put it onto my MP3. A year later I finally got the
  album out again and it bleu me away. I realize that there is
  something slightly Barry Mannilowish about We'll Do It All Again,
  because he has some lungs, not because of style or anything. He
  reminds me more of Jellyfish, or They Might Be Giants. Some songs
  are so pathetic, vulnerable, and a little too honest for comfort
  as far as lyrics go, but they are energetic and hopeful in their
  delivery. Anyone who appreciates art for arts sake will probably
  like this album. The songwriting is superb and precisely
  produced. The second hidden track is a real gem, that you don't
  need to relate to in order to appreciate. The lyrics are clever
  and fun even though several songs have a theme of
  loneliness.</Text>
  <Text category="music">Pete Rock and C.L. Smooth came out of no
  where with this classic in "92". I was expecting the T-ROY
  tribute to be the only highlight, but this joint was bangin! The
  very underrated CL had the dope metaphors and complex lyrics.
  Chocolate Boy Wonder had the legendary "horns" going on. The
  whole album is a banger. Fav's are Pete's Sake, The
  Basement(Pete's cuz Heavy D rips it), Mecca and the Soul Brother,
  Troy- They Reminisce, Straighten it Out( a kick in the balls for
  bootleggers), Ghetto's of the Mind and Skinz(CL's cuz Grand Puba
  steals the show on this one). Eternally Classic, rock on.</Text>
  <Text category="music">I've had this cd since it came out and it
  continues to be my favorite. It's a cd that I can put in anytime
  and thoroughly enjoy. This would be my pick for the cd to have
  while stranded on an island. It never gets boring and made me
  appreciate just how good Schon is. Unbelievable. If you like
  this, you'll like Eric Johnson's Venus Isle album too. Two of my
  all time favorites</Text>
  <Text category="music">It doesn't get any better than this. This
  album is a must have for all true Judas Priest fans. This is
  Priest when they were really getting good. The guitars and the
  vocals rock you to the core</Text>
  <Text category="music">This might be the best CD that has come
  out this year. It may be Will Oldham's best CD since "Viva Last
  Blues." It may be better than "Viva Last Blues" although these
  are two different styled CDs. "The letting go" has a mostly very
  mellow sound. Almost every song is beautiful. The string and
  guitar melodies are uplifting. Will Oldham's voice is grounding,
  it is the familiar voice you have heard for the past decade or
  so. Dawn McCarthy's voice will then again lift you up. McCarthy's
  voice is a fantastic companion to Oldham's. Other singers/bands
  have tried to use a female voice to echo or accompany the lead
  vocal and it has often become irritating. This is not the case
  with "the letting go," McCarthy's accompaniment adds so much to
  the album but without taking away from Oldham. I haven't listened
  to a Will Oldham album since "Ease down the Road." This makes me
  want to go back and listen to those albums I have missed. One
  song in particular, "The Seedling" (I believe) has a different
  sound than the rest of the album. It has a harsher sound, but is
  still a good song. This is a great introduction if you are new to
  Oldham or if you are returning listener.</Text>
  <Text category="music">This is a wonderful effort by the Del
  Castillo brothers and their band. Mark and Rick are great
  guitarists and the band is one of the best that I have ever
  heard. I hate that anyone would compare them to the Gypsy Kings
  or Strunz and Farrah, because I believe they (Del Castillo) are
  far superior. Even though I am a huge fan of Santana, I think
  Brothers of the Castle and Vida are more entertaining and
  satisfying than Santana's last CD. If you are a fan of this
  genre, you should possess both Del Castillo CD's.....Brothers of
  the Castle and Vida. Their live show is among the best that I
  have ever seen</Text>
  <Text category="music">As he did with "Parade", the soundtrack to
  his last vanity project "Under the Cherry Moon", Prince provides
  a musically invigorating soundtrack to "Graffiti Bridge", which
  is a hopelessly silly film. No matter. "Graffiti Bridge",
  Prince's first album of the 90's, is also one of Prince's best
  albums of the 90's. "New Power Generation" serves as the title
  track to Prince's new band, and it's a powerful, funky manifesto.
  "The Question of U" is exotic and intoxicating. "Elephants and
  Flowers" is an upbeat song about spiritual redemption, whereas
  "Tick Tick Bang" is Prince at his most joyously raunchy. Although
  most of Prince's material is exceptionally strong here, the
  collaborations and contributions by other artists are a mixed
  bag. "We Can Funk" is a simmering duet between Prince and
  funkmaster George Clinton, and Tevin Campbell provides some
  youthful exuberance to "Round and Round". But the tracks by The
  Time mostly fall flat. I've personally always found Morris Day to
  be a one-trick pony with his effete pimp routine, and his one
  trick gets boring quickly. It's obvious that with "Graffiti
  Bridge" Prince is trying to create the feel and atmosphere of a
  funky block party. But I can't help but wonder, without the
  tracks featuring other artists, if "Graffiti Bridge" wouldn't be
  more highly regarded as one of Prince's better albums</Text>
  <Text category="music">Even if you don't know much about Donny
  Hathaway, this collection of songs is a fun mix and it's very
  moving. It includes some classics with Roberta Flack that are
  terrific. I enjoy it tremendously</Text>
  <Text category="music">At first, I thought the only reason why I
  wanted this CD was because Idina Menzel was on it. But now, after
  listening to the whole CD, I was right, Idina Menzel was AMAZING,
  and all of the other cast members are incredibly talented too. I
  would HIGHLY recommend this because it is a very interesting
  story, it's incredibly complex music (theoretically), but at the
  same time it is VERY enjoyable!!!! I would give it more stars if
  I could... but I am only allowed 5... :(</Text>
  <Text category="music">This is the stuff that rap dreams are made
  of! Just like the movie itself, this CD is packed with moment
  after moment of perpetual rollercoaster type thrills that leaves
  the listener in a sheer state of funk frenzy! The talent assmbled
  here is tops and just seems to keep coming at you so, get in, sit
  down, buckle up and shut the F&amp;amp;#k up because it's about
  to get rowdy up in here!</Text>
  <Text category="music">It realy has been a long wait after
  Jellyfish. This Roger Joseph Manning solo effort is as beautiful
  as music can get, giving wagonloads of goosebumps all the way. If
  you have a craving for the ultimate in sophisticate popmusic you
  should get this rare jewel. And don't wait for the US release: it
  lacks one song from a perfect 11 like the Japanese has. I sure
  wouldn't want to miss any of these tracks. Very higly
  recommended!</Text>
  <Text category="music">I have loved the Swans since my Danceteria
  days in early 80s New York. But its a fitful, frustrating love.
  You get the sense from 'Incandesent' that the Swans forgot to
  stop partying. That they never took the time to put together more
  than a handful of songs. Oh, but what songs they were. This
  collection is for completists and aging post-punker (like myself)
  who wished they'd shared a pint with the boys back when simply
  getting stoned was a subversive act. Its a nice collection of
  beautiful, quirky oddities here. But a few gems are missing "Holy
  Holy", "1982", "World of Milk and Blood" come to mind. Maybe on
  an 'Ashes' reissue. In the meantime, scoop this up. Simpson
  &amp;amp; Company deserve the attention. If you really care about
  the band, buy it directly from their label, Renascent. That way
  the company (and the band) can make a few pennies. Maybe enough
  to mine the crates for a second hits collection.</Text>
  <Text category="music">Buy it. Now. Stop reading. Are you still
  reading???? Okay, so I'll tell you my reason why. Reason(s) why.
  5.1 sound. DTS. Different (some versions better to my
  ears/psyche) than the CD. Flavor. Beautiful production. Did I
  mention DTS - you gotta hear this in DTS. And she and her band
  deserve and have earned every penny you could spend on her
  (gratuitously inciting flaming). I am just hoping that she will
  give us the opportunity to have DVD's covering her 'Girl in the
  Other Room' and her 'From This Moment On'.</Text>
  <Text category="music">I love this album, the best of Phil
  Collins. I believe every great artist always delivers their best
  stuff when they are in a rut. I know he wrote some of the songs
  on this album bases on his bad times/suffering with his ex wife.
  He did not realize how much pain she was in and the mood and
  moment is captured very well. He is a great composer. Too bad
  most of his new songs...2006, times are different and so is his
  life, I do not enjoy them as much. Once an artist becomes more
  Self-Actualized much of their best work becomes just that a
  memory.</Text>
  <Text category="music">This album sends mixed messages to the
  listener. Some tunes are overally happy, some quite depressing. I
  can only explain it in parts: Radio Song - the first track of the
  album comes out quite upbeat and rollicking. A guest vocal from
  KRS-One makes it quite a lively tune. Puts you in the mood for a
  more Green-style album. Losing my Religion - Huh? What's this?
  The album delves into uneasy angst as a troubled Stipe spills
  problems out to the listener. The tortured riff holds out until
  the end, telling the listener this isn't quite like Green or
  Document... Low - The depression lingers on. Low is a tune
  sadened speech about the absence of love and how it can make you
  feel so low. My favorite on the album, I think it's delicate and
  sad. My #1 downer tune. Near Wild Heaven - Another uneasy tune
  that has a touch of angst. Deals with the apprehension of love.
  Endgame - A curious tune. Can't be interpreted either happy or
  sad, for it is instrumental. It could go either way, it's written
  in a major key, yet the melody sounds sobered, almost as if it's
  a requiem. Shiny Happy People - Takes the listener up to a very
  uncomfortable level of happiness. A low point on the album, yet I
  interprate it by feeling uneasily happy after the anti-pastorial
  earlier tracks. Belong - One track I don't understand, yet enjoy
  and see it as a break from the main goal of the album. Half a
  World Away - Ah, so beautiful. Essentially about enjoying life's
  finer moments at the expense of moments to come. Truly happy, but
  still holds on to the softcore angst. Texarkana - The lyrics and
  pulsing bass line make me draw conclusions that it's about
  unfulfilled life goals. Delves deeper into seeds of depression
  until... Country Feedback - The climax of saddness on the album.
  This song is excruciatingly sad. The melody, the lyrics... It
  kept me awake all night. One of the saddest songs I've ever
  heard. Me in Honey - A powerful, joyous ending that basically
  sums up the fact the everything turns out OK in the end. This
  album is highly recomended. R.E.M. are an incredible band.</Text>
  <Text category="music">Evan Dando has once again delivered an
  astounding collection of pop/punk songs. This album rocks like
  Lovey and is almost as catchy as Come On Feel. I've been
  listening to this album for weeks on end.</Text>
  <Text category="music">I wore out my tape of Cypress. Afoot is
  great, but Cypress is amazing. I bought this while stationed in
  the Army. There weren't too many "new wave" tapes available at
  the PX, and I wasn't going to listen to Def Leppard or Bon Jovi.
  So I bought Cypress. One of those rare tapes that I bought 20
  years ago and still listen to every few months (The Jam's Snap
  and Setting Sons, and The Smith's Hatful of Hollow are 3 other
  tapes I never tired of). Get this CD. Get it now! It is great.
  Thanks for reissuing it.</Text>
  <Text category="music">And you will to. This music conveys the
  happy feeling of Latin music produced for the American ear from
  1946 to 1949. I picked up the album from Amazon after listening
  to selected cuts offered by the Yahoo Music radio service -- "El
  Cumbanchero" and "Cuban Pete". The cuts are almost all strong and
  all are well recorded, especially when you compare the sound
  quality to those on some other big band recordings that have been
  reissued. "Babalu" which became Desi Arnez signature piece on the
  I Love Lucy TV show is probably one of the least appealing, and
  that may be why it was used comedically in the TV show through
  the years. The highlight cuts include -- "Peanut Vender",
  "Holiday in Havana", "You Can in Yucatan" and "Brazil". While
  brass, strings, drums and guitars tend to dominate much of
  today's music, this album gives the spotlight to a variety of
  percussion instruments, flute, clarinet and bass clarinet. It is
  refreshing to hear them in solo. The liner notes by Will
  Friedwald are extensive and give you a glimpse into this period
  of Desi's life between his movie career and the defining work he
  and Lucille Ball did on television in the 50's. I could not
  recommend this album more and hope you enjoy it as much as I
  did</Text>
  <Text category="music">I purchased this CD with the intent of
  finding fine players playing fine music. What I found, however,
  was and outstanding example of chamber music as its finest. The
  ensemble these 3 players generate is some of the finest ensemble
  music playing recorded. Each player displays exceptional
  technique, both in the mechanical and lyrical aspects of their
  playing. Most impressive is listening to Istomen who, playing a
  very technically and lyrically demanding part, voices his playing
  with such finess and carefull attention to detail to the strings;
  a feat very difficult to do as a pianist. This is an excellent
  recording for the professional to study a score from or for the
  avid listener to play over and over</Text>
  <Text category="music">THIS ALBUM MARKED A RETURN OF SORTS TO THE
  OLD TRADEMARK ISLEY BROTHERS SOUND,AND IT'S OFF THE HOOK.JAM AND

  <Text category="music">I appreciate bands like Ima Robot, Film
  School and electroclash artists for trying to add a little
  balance into Alternative music, or at least I appreciate Film
  School for trying to merge the beauty of Electronica with
  Alternative and allow it to simmer down to the always wonderous
  shoegazing while bringing back the trend of the New Wave you
  loved in the 80's. The thing about it is it is bands like these
  that are adding their own style into music making it worth your
  minutes and expanding your genres from just on band. Have you
  heard Depeche Mode's albums with a wind of Boards of Canada? Call
  this the album that it would have made more sense for Maximo Park
  to create if you will but this album is America's response to all
  other international bands showing us off hard. (The band is from
  San Francisco, I believe) And their influence for this album is a
  mix of Electronica and 80's music (My Bloody Valentine. New
  Order? Depeche Mode?) all leading them to create an album that
  doesn't quite call the band in question an American Radiohead per
  se, but with half of the music smothered in swirling guitars,
  accompanying keyboards, and a leaders effort to push the band
  forward, a band that is trying to reach heights of originality.
  Film School's debut (if you aren't counting their imported EP)
  kicks off with am intro wielding only swirls of guitar and
  electronics before finally bringing you into an illuminating "On
  and On" that may force your urge to name this band after Interpol
  and Elefant and a little bit of The Bravery in there, too, but
  will not let you throughout this entire album. Their current
  single "Pitfalls" may cause them to swing on the vine of
  similarity since everyone is trying to bring back New Wave these
  days, but worse can happen for a band like this. The backward
  keyboard melody should more than make you tell the difference.
  The second actual interlude "Garrison" is where Boards of
  Canada's wind starts blowing through the CD, before heading back
  into the record that will be likely to redefine the sound of
  "cool". If there is ever an album to chase after and count on for
  the safety of New Wave and the health of Alternative, I don't see
  a better candidate for leg-ups than Film School's latest. Rating:
  7.5/1</Text>
  <Text category="music">Without a doubt, this is a must-have for
  any fan of the Go-Betweens and the place to start if you are new
  to the band. "A man far wiser than myself once referred to "16
  Lovers Lane" as 'the indie Rumours'" the liner notes say in this
  fantastic re-issue of the Go-Betweens ultimate set of songs. No
  truer words were ever spoken about this amazing set. Why this
  album didn't spawn at least five top 10 singles is a mystery that
  will never be solved. But needless to say this is a fantastic set
  made even better by the wonderful packaging and extras included
  with this re-release For those of you unfamiliar with the
  Go-Betweens work, this was the consummate work of their 80's
  heyday, for a great many reasons. The music is bright pop music,
  crystal clear, but in no way is it featherweight pop. The songs
  are beautifully arranged, every instrument, vocal, handclap, and
  anything else perfectly placed with not a note out of place, but
  this can be said of nearly every Go-Betweens release. The lyrics,
  plaintive ruminations on love, are clearly written by two
  songwriters/lyricists going through the opposite sides of
  relationships. I will not go into detail here as the liner notes
  tell the story, but the interplay within the band as these
  relationships play out are what drove the entire release. Each
  lyricist, Grant McLennan and Robert Forster, gets about half of
  the album's lyrics, and that is what makes the CD special. Images
  of the giddyness of new love ("Love Goes On!") are juxtaposed
  with images of love lost in such as way as to be almost shocking.
  "I'm ten feet under water/standing in a sunken canoe/looking up
  at the water lillies/they're green and violet blue/still the sun
  it finds/a place to light me" from "Love Is a Sign" has to be one
  of the best descriptions of how it feels when a relationship
  falls apart that has ever been placed in song. These themes are
  repeatedly dealt with in different ways, from young lovers
  meeting and breaking up to the "old" love of couples with
  children ("You Can't Say No Forever") having a fight. The bonus
  material in this handsome double-disc set is truly welcome. The
  videos to "Streets of Your Town" (still undoubtedly the best song
  on this incredible collection) and "Was There Anything I Could
  Do?" underscore the relationships going on in the band while not
  seeming too terribly out of date. The bonus disc of outtakes and
  b-sides is also a fantastic addition to the set as it includes
  several songs that didn't make the final album cut but are
  presented as they were at the end of the recording sessions,
  being nearly complete but having that rough edge of a final demo.
  The real treat come with the acoustic "demos" that are included.
  "You Won't Find It Again," "Apples in Bed," and "Head Over Heels"
  are played only by McLennan and Forster on acoustic guitars,
  providing for an intimacy that is unmatched anywhere. To top it
  all off, the packaging (including an awesome essay by British
  songwriter Andrew Male) is exquisite, providing detail on the
  circumstances surrounding the album as well as any pertinent
  recording information. This is "16 Lovers Lane" as it was meant
  to be heard--enjoy!</Text>
  <Text category="music">My son loves music and really likes Dan
  Zanes. We started with the videos on Disney and the "catch that
  train" song really got us singing, so we ordered this CD. Now my
  son sings along with it, dances and jumps around. Dan Zanes
  really is fun for the family</Text>
  <Text category="music">I was looking for some music I could play
  in the car or around the house with my 19-month-old son and came
  across this one--the exact same "album" that I had when I was his
  age! I'm so glad they redid it! One of my fondest memories</Text>
  <Text category="music">Gene Watson was one of the finest voices
  in country music, and this compilation of 18 hits provide a fine
  sampling of that voice. Considered by some to be "hard country",
  I find Gene Watson to have a more "pop" oriented voice that
  combined well with his selection of songs; and in the '70's, that
  proved to be enough to keep him on the charts. While many of the
  songs on this album are pure country, others are the typical,
  drab, 70's pop that filled the void between the Nashville Sound
  and the New Traditional era of the 80's. In any case, there is no
  doubt that Gene Watson earned his spot in Country Music, and this
  collection carries those hits that made him the household name he
  is today; including his signature songs "Farewell Party" and
  "Love in the Hot Afternoon". If you prefer the more traditional
  country sound, his "You Could Know as Much About a Stranger" and
  "Should I Come Home" are also included</Text>
  <Text category="music">Gene Watson's music was introduced to me
  by a friend who played drums for Sonny James, Ernest Tubb, and
  Dottie West. I had never heard of him but then when I heard his
  voice on the CD I knew the songs. It's amazing to me how a person
  with such a great voice has never received the attention that he
  should. Every song is great but the one which I really like is
  &amp;amp;quot;The Old Man and His Horn&amp;amp;quot;. This was a
  song I had never heard. It also shows the versatility of Gene's
  song selections. He has the best voice of any country singer I
  have ever heard</Text>
  <Text category="music">Honestly, Led Zeppelin is the ONLY artist
  that can create monumental album after monumental album and have
  not ONE bad song. When you listen to one of their albums in your
  car, there's no, "Oh, I really like track 2, but I don't like the
  next couple, so I'll skip to track 5 after that one's over." Now
  it is common opinion that the classic albums of Led Zeppelin are
  the first five, and "Houses of the Holy" is the fifth one. This
  is Zeppelin at their pinnacle, which in my opinion, they never
  fall from. "The Song Remains the Same" is Pagey at his best with
  his Gibson double-neck. The song itself makes you want to ride
  the wind because it is so airy, but at the same time a fast-paced
  rock tune. Page's initial (and INCREDIBLE) guitar solo makes this
  song the perfect initial song on this album. "The Rain Song" is a
  lovelorn masterpiece with the lovely sounds of an orchestra to
  help create this mood. The lyrics are deep, and while the song to
  me is melancholy, it is also refreshing. "Over the Hills and Far
  Away" is a 5-trillion star song, with amazing acoustic and
  electric guitars with mystic lyrics. "The Crunge" is groovy and
  funny. The bass is really felt in this song, and odd spoken
  lyrics at the end give a laugh. "Dancing Days" is very far out,
  but a summer-y song with an addictive riff. "D'yer Mak'er" is one
  to definitely highlight Bonzo's masterful rhythm skills, or in
  other words, GREAT DRUMS! Equal to that is Pagey on guitar and
  Robert's singing, "I still love you so...but I can't let you
  go..." "No Quarter" is the quiet masterpiece that is credited to
  John Paul for an exquisite keyboard solo. "The Ocean" is quite
  the upbeat song on this album with a raunchy riff. An overall
  energizing song. This is the best deal for this album--do not
  pass it up! I hope this will be a permanent fixture to your
  collection...not one bad song</Text>
  <Text category="music">This is a great cd with many good songs as
  it is one of my favorites and bruce rules</Text>
  <Text category="music">low tech and brilliant, music that seems
  to have channeled Zappa, Winchester Cathedral, and god knows what
  else. incredibly funny, and then suddenly sad. mr pink is a
  genius, you betcha. and he explains what it is and how it is to
  live here in this strange quasi-city in the shadow of the

  <Text category="music">Trace Adkins has set them up and knocked
  them down once more! Can Trace ever produce any music that sounds
  bad? His low deep bass voice continues to tickle our ears and the
  message of the songs he chooses to put together on cd continue to
  proclaim loud and strong that he loves everything in life from
  his dog to his woman to his God! I strongly recommend that
  everyone has Trace's latest CD in their collection! A big
  ten-four in my CD player</Text>
  <Text category="music">"The Dreaming was one of those albums that
  I found in my parents CD collection when I was young and I
  haven't outgrown it yet. My parents seemed to hate it and never
  bought a Kate Bush CD after it (though I recently bought her
  whole collection except "The Whole Story" as it's just a greatest
  hits!). This album took me a very long time to get into however.
  I listened to it several times as a child and then put it away
  because I thought it was too strange. I took it out then several
  years later and loved it. I would now say it could be my all time
  favourite CD and is better than "Hounds Of Love" as I see it. The
  songs all stand on their own and Bush's voice is brilliant and
  her quirky themes shine through. This is the only album that I
  will never skip a track because I'm always in the mood for them
  all. 1. "Sat In Your Lap"- A great opening track. Bush deals with
  whether she can be bothered to do something or not. The
  instruments are great as always. 2. "There Goes A Tenner"- A
  notable song for the quirky British accent Bush puts on. The
  instruments are very good and remind me of the '80's (as it was
  made then!). That was a good decade for music! 3. "Pull Out The
  Pin"- The piano arrangement is excellent in this song and the
  chorus is so good. The lyrics are about someone who is in war and
  thinking about pulling out the pin of a grenade. The song was
  inspired by a documentary. 4. "Suspended In Gaffa"- I don't
  actually know what Gaffa is but this song is still so great and
  catchy. The lyrics are quirky and the instrumentation is
  excellent. 5. "Leave It Open"- An excellent song that reminds me
  more of "Hounds Of Love". The instrumentation is excellent as
  always. 6. "The Dreaming"- Another brilliant song which is so
  funny because of Bush's Australian accent. The production is good
  and so is the songwriting. 7. "Night Of The Swallow"- The use of
  Irish traditional music is a nice effect to this song. The
  singing by Bush is superb and the song is flawless! 8. "All The
  Love"- The song has a sadder feel to it but is excellent. The
  lyrics are unusual and very well done. The instruments complement
  Bush's superb voice and never overtake! 9. "Houdini"- The album
  cover is to do with this song. The song is excellent with a
  really quirky chorus and good instrumentation. 10. "Get Out Of My
  House"- A perfect way to end an amazing album. The lyrics are so
  good and it is so funny at the end when she turns into a mule
  (within the song obviously). It is something only Kate Bush could
  have written! Overall I think it is an amazing album though I can
  see why people don't like it. It could be a little too
  experimental for some though for me it is perfect. Kate Bush
  shows she was the original alternative female and the best (yes,
  she's better than Tori Amos). She is one of the few geniuses of
  music and an all time amazing artist. Reccomended to everyone
  into alternative, especially Tori Amos fans! MARK- 10/1</Text>
  <Text category="music">What else can be said about this great CD?
  It's one of the best pop records ever made and you never get sick
  of hearing these 10 songs. "Child of Vision" is the best (the
  piano solo is killer) of the best, but this is one of those rare
  CD's that you just pop in and let the entire thing play till the
  end (no skipping over songs you don't like). A true
  classic</Text>
  <Text category="music">A lot of music fans have mused over why
  Matthew Sweet did not achieve greater success with the masses
  despite his obvious ability to write very catchy songs. "Sick of
  Myself" single-handedly rejuvenated my faith in the power of pop
  music at a time when pop seemed to have exhausted its
  possibilities. But in retrospect Sweet simply wasn't a very
  marketable commodity for the music industry, and on top of that
  his vocals and lyrics somehow didn't grab people. Its not that he
  doesn't sing with passion or feeling, but somehow the words seem
  to get lost in the mix. Perhaps its a production thing;
  regardless, the vocals on a MS album always seem to be secondary
  to the music and that is a no-no for any great singer-songwriter.
  There are some truly impressive (albeit derivative) stuff here:
  "What Matters" is in my opinion the greatest Byrds song never
  written, "Hide" is a beautiful piano ballad that wouldn't seem
  out of place on Badfinger compilation, "If Time Permits" has some
  of the most beautiful chorus harmonies not written by Brian
  Wilson, etc. etc. "I've Been Waiting" works well in combining
  catchy melody with plaintive adolescent desire, and "Girlfriend"
  is for the most part a great rocker. However, after the
  relatively simple production of Girlfriend, his later albums got
  bogged down in an attempt to recreate a "wall of sound" feeling,
  which quite frankly doesn't really work unless you're Phil
  Spector. Not much here can be completely discounted and the new
  songs fit in quite well (although I probably would have included
  "Evangeline" at the expense of "Ready"). Despite the undeniable
  quality of the music there is nothing life-changing here and
  ultimately great music must at least have the semblance of being
  life-changing. Still heartily recommended for fans of catchy,
  melodic pop-rock</Text>
  <Text category="music">Really nothing on this is bad. The best
  IMHO is Rubyhorse, the Brian Jonestown Massacre and the Subways
  but a case could be made for any of the songs. The only problem
  is now I have 8 other CDs I need to buy</Text>
  <Text category="music">After Trouble and his Austin City Limits
  appearance, I thought he was just another very good singer
  songwriter. This follow up has made me reconsider, because this
  is the work of a very thoughtful perfectionist. He waited and it
  was worth the wait. This reminded me immediately of John Lennon
  (please don't punish me for blasphemy) and others that knew how
  to touch you with simplicity done in a classy way. I didn't
  expect something this deep for a sophomore recording.
  Enjoy</Text>
  <Text category="music">The title gets it right - this is a very
  fun album. There are a lot of great songs on here. Infectious
  lyrics and music - it still surprises me that Matthew Sweet isn't
  more popular than he is. One other thing...it's a sin that "We're
  The Same" wasn't a bigger hit than it was. Truly a great
  song</Text>
  <Text category="music">I've been a Robben Ford fan since 1979.
  Each time he offers a new recording, I try to purchase it as
  quickly as possible. Robben can ROCK and play slow blues. Every
  cut on this cd is worth listening to over and over again. I can't
  say enough! Robben is one of the least known and treasured
  guitartists of our generation! If you like Robben Ford, don't
  miss Chris Cain. This man is also a guitar genius</Text>
  <Text category="music">I'm a horn performance major, and I bought
  this box set because I needed recordings of all of Beethoven's
  symphonies but at a low cost. Now first off, yes, they sound
  great. However, I've noticed a problem in the first movement of
  the fifth symphony: Karajan changes Beethoven's orchestration!
  Allow me to explain: The horn players at the time would have been
  using valveless horns -- instruments bound to the overtone
  series. On the "natural" or "hand" horn, pitches that fall on the
  overtone series can be played without adjustment (like a bugle)
  but any other note must be bent into tune by using the right hand
  to close off the bell. This technique was effective in allowing
  the horn to play most chromatic pitches, however, the "stopped"
  notes have an entirely different tone color; most composers
  favored "open" pitches, especially for symphonic works. In the
  exposition, the second theme is announced by a call in E-flat by
  the horns. However, in the recap, the same call must be in the
  tonic (C), as dictated by sonata form. The horn part is written
  for E-flat horns, which meant they would have been tuned so that
  the harmonic series emphasised E-flat major, the relative major.
  The E-flat call of the exposition falls entirely on partials the
  hornists can play with no significant adjustment -- they are all
  "open" notes. However, in the recapitulation, the C call would
  include two "closed" notes if it were played by the E-flat horn.
  The horns could change crooks and become C horns, in which case
  the call would again be all open partials, but Beethoven does not
  do this; I am uncertain whether he wanted the horns in E-flat for
  the transition, leaving them no time to change, or if it was
  simply not yet common practice to change crooks in the middle of
  a movement. For whatever reason, Beethoven left the horns in
  E-flat and rather than writing the call in the horns again, which
  would include stopped pitches and have a very different sound,
  Beethoven moved the call to the bassoons. In Karajan's recording,
  the second theme is announced by the horns in both the exposition
  and the recapitulation. Granted, if Beethoven had been writing
  for our modern valve horns, he might have written both calls in
  the horn section. There is no way to prove for certain that this
  is the case, however. It strikes me as very arrogant to "correct"
  Beethoven's instrumentation, and I feel that a respect for
  historical accuracy by preserving the master's writing is a more
  prudent performance choice.</Text>
  <Text category="music">This is the album that all Kenny G fans
  have been waiting for!!! It was well worth the wait too. Not only
  is Kenny G at the top of his game but the vocalists are GREAT!
  The entire group of artists is so eclectic. Thank you Kenny
  G!!</Text>
  <Text category="music">To be honest I can't think of a word that
  can explain the emotional link with this album apart from it
  being the most beautiful sound I've heard. For me listening to
  this album makes me feel emotionally confused but absolutely
  complete at the same time, never before has an album stopped me
  in my tracks as firmly as this one. My favourite songs on the
  album are "the only moment we were alone" and "six days at the
  bottom of the ocean" every time my ears are blessed with these
  artworks I'm am fixated on nothing else but them. I literally
  cannot communicate with anyone or anything I just have to listen
  to them intently. This album is not as experimental as "those who
  tell the truth shall die those who tell the truth shall live
  forever" but I feel it is just as good and the songs are put
  together impeccably well, with no song being neither longer nor
  shorter than it has to be. I love the pure, clean sound of this
  album and see it as light as the wind. The trance that this album
  provides is indescribable; I'm not saying if you buy this album
  it will have this exact effect on you this description is merely
  from a personal note. Either way I strongly recommend this band
  and album to anybody who is looking for a purchase, for you can
  have no doubt that this album is extremely well produced,
  written, recorded, thought out and sounding. Buy it, you will not
  regret your choice one bit.</Text>
  <Text category="music">The one song I know is a remake is
  "Goodnight My Love." I know this because I have it on the
  original 45 issue and the CD version is an inferior remake. But
  the others with which I'm familiar - but don't have original
  vinyl to compare, only memories - seem authentic. The audio
  quality is great and certainly superior to some of the CDs you
  find these days which are only re-recordings of old vinyl or
  cassettes.</Text>
  <Text category="music">I bought this CD after I'd watched the
  movie the first three times. The music is wonderful. I bought it
  specifically for the song they sing in the church scene - "I
  Don't Care to Stay Here Long" and I want it played at my own
  funeral way out there in "someday". You can't hear it without
  smiling and the words are much easier to understand on the CD
  than in the movie. But just in case, here's the first
  foot-stompin' verse: Fare -- well, vain world! I'm going home. My
  Savior smiles and bids me come and I don't care to stay here
  long. Bright Angels beckon me away to sing God's praise in
  endless day and I don't care to stay here long. Right up Yonder!
  Christians, away up Yon-der. Oh, yes my Lord, for I don't care to
  stay here long</Text>
  <Text category="music">I can't say with the words must
  listen!</Text>
  <Text category="music">I can't even begin to say how much I love
  these albums (i just picked UYI 1 to write my review for both).
  Everyone always says that Appetite is Guns best album...no way in
  hell. The Illusion albums are so much richer. Now don't get me
  wrong, I love appetite but it is more of a party album with cool
  guitar work and catchy tunes. The illusion twins are just so much
  deeper lyrically and have many more styles woven in and out of a
  hard rock framework. I can identify with so many of axls lyrics,
  and the music just makes them stand out so much more. Slash is
  basically the best hard rock guitar player ever, and he has more
  awesome solos and leads on these albums than most guitar players
  have in a career. And the best part about these albums is that
  the lesser known songs are usually the best, such as: Locomotive,
  Bad Apples, Dont Damn Me, The Garden, Pretty Tied Up, Coma, Civil
  War, Get in the Ring, Breakdown, Estranged (kind of popular but
  still fairly unknown) 14 Years, Bad Obscession, Dust n Bones,
  Dead Horse, and more. Then of course there are the hits, Dont
  Cry, November Rain, Knockin on Heavens Door, Live and Let Die,
  You Could Be Mine etc. The only songs i dont really like that
  much are My World (wtf?) and shotgun blues, but everything else
  is just so gdamn good. Do yourself a favor and go buy these
  albums if u consider yourself a hard rock fan. The illusion
  albums are art, plain and simple</Text>
  <Text category="music">We started playing this for our one year
  old when we were driving on a short trip out of town. As babies
  sometimes do, she began screaming and was unconsolable... UNTIL
  we turned on Rocket Ship Beach. Polly wolly doodle calmed her
  right down and continues to do so. We played that song at least 6
  times in a row that day! now that she's a little older, she
  points to the cd player in the car if something else is playing,
  requesting her cd be played. I've always enjoyed a wide range of
  music, and was afraid that after having a child, we'd be reduced
  to listening to watered down "kid music" like that purple
  dinosaur and those australian guys. There is a mixture of
  classics reimagined and new songs that i find myself humming all
  of the time. There is a good variety of instrumentation and
  styles. Our daughter claps at the end of her favorites and often
  waves her arms about. Got kids? Buy this cd!</Text>
  <Text category="music">...else if Michigan was on vinyl I would
  have worn it out by now. Illinois was my first venture into the
  sound-world of Sufjan Stevens, and no doubt it his most
  impressive outing to date. However the subtle spendour of the
  earlier Michigan has ousted it as my favourite. Perhaps less
  eclectic and entertaining than Illinois, but more soulful and
  beautiful. Ultimately it's the one I'd take to the proverbial
  Desert Island. There's not a single track in this 74 minute CD
  that I'd want to skip or drop from my MP3 playlist, but
  highlights for me are Romulus (gentle and heartbreaking),
  Sleeping Bear (musically gorgeous), and Vito's Ordination Song
  (like being gently hugged). p.s. So often the 'bonus tracks' on a
  CD can seem superfluous and substandard but the 2 extras on my CD
  (Marching Band and Pickerel Lake) are both excellent.</Text>
  <Text category="music">His singing style is very unique as are
  his lyrics. He has an eclectic mix of love songs, "we are the
  world" type songs and a few others on this album. He has the
  staying power for long the long term and I would love to see him
  mature throughout the years and watch to see where he goes. I
  loved Streetcorner Symphony! It is so upbeat it can pull me out
  of whatever is ailing me. Lonely No More is my theme song for
  right now in my life - needless to say I am replaying grooves in
  that one! Enjoy this album - I sure do</Text>
  <Text category="music">Like many Amazon reviewers, I play a
  teensy bit of guitar. I know just enough to know how incredible
  these guys are. This is the best, most exciting acoustic playing
  I've heard since Al DiMeola cut "Race With Devil on Spanish
  Highway" on his Elegant Gypsy Suite LP. Watching the Del Castillo
  brothers shred on the DVD part of this set will assure that I
  don't get anywhere near my guitar for a long time. Since Robert
  Rodriguez (Desperado, Spy Kids, etc) filmed the performances, we
  get appallingly good, tight shots of the fretwork. People, it
  can't be done. I will henceforth concentrate on harmonica, and
  try to forget that Sugar Blue does about the same level of
  impossibility on that instrument. The songs and playing come from
  a somewhat traditional Latin, Mexicano perspective, but the
  overall sound is more like Santana when Carlos goes acoustic. The
  "hidden track" on the CD most overtly shows that the Del Castillo
  brothers love their blues and rock almost as much as the Latin
  roots music. This is an obvious buy for anyone who enjoys Latin
  music or great guitar work of any style, but it is more accurate
  to say that anyone who is not totally averse to this style should
  check it out. The quality of music here really transcends the
  genre</Text>
  <Text category="music">This was one of my first albums I got. I
  got it because of 'Paradise City' but got adapted quickly to
  'Welcome to the Jungle' and rest. There were only few more
  metal/rock albums that made such impact on my taste during teens:
  Maiden's 'Powerslave', Megadeth 'Rust in Peace' and Suicidal
  Tendencies 'Lights...Camera...revolution'</Text>
  <Text category="music">Without getting too much into it this
  Album is pretty good. 4 stars for some bad ass tracks. My favs
  are Tears from the moon, Beautiful things , As the rush comes.
  All in all worth the money</Text>
  <Text category="music">I, like many others, have been waiting for
  this album for quite some time. Right from the first track, I was
  hooked. "All My Days" is a haunting, melodic, heartbreaking
  opening to a fantastic album. "Breathe" has a subdued yet
  powerful message. "Home" is just plain fun. "Song For You" is
  sweet, somber, and hopeful. However, I must say that the Four
  Songs version of "Orange Sky" is what I consider to be the
  greatest song ever written. However, the Time Without Consequence
  version is devastatingly bad (when held up to the light of the
  original). The new version is too fast, has an inexplicably
  irritating percussion, and just doesn't dig into the soul the way
  the Four Songs version does. I will always be baffled by this
  remake. It is truly awful. Its only saving grace is that the
  original is still available. But that is by no means any reason
  to avoid this CD. In fact, those who do not know the original
  "Orange Sky" may fall in love with this one. But it is my duty to
  warn those looking for an "Orange Sky" that matches the original
  that you will be severely disappointed. Outside of this
  single-song complaint, this CD has vaulted to one of the best I
  own</Text>
  <Text category="music">EDITED: It took me a while to enjoy
  listening to this whole album since I am used to listening to her
  recent work - Afterglow &amp;amp; Surfacing. This is truly an
  outstanding album and definitely overlooked. In my opinion, this
  ranks as the 3rd best Sarah McLachlan album with #1 Fumbling
  Towards Ecstasy, and #2 Afterglow -- even though Surfacing
  outsold these 2 albums. I can't say much about the album, because
  some of the reviews here say what I would say for this album as
  well. Drawn to the Rhythm: 5/5 Into The Fire: 5/5 The Path of
  Thorns (Terms): 5/5 - first song from Solace I heard. Truly
  unique than the rest since she sings at a lower range. I Will Not
  Forget You: 5+/5 - LOVE IT, My #1 favorite of all her songs on
  this album. Lost: 4.5/5 (this is a first for Sarah McLachlan to
  have male background singers singing - Edited: actually this
  would be the third as her 1st album "Touch" had male bg singers
  for the tracks Trust and Strange World) Back Door Man: 5/5 - I
  truly enjoy this song, this song sort of reminds me of Stupid
  from Afterglow. I love her intense voice and wish she could do
  more songs like this. Shelter: 5/5 - really sad and it's actually
  the second Solace song I heard after 'Path' Black: 5+/5 - this is
  my second favorite song. All in all, deep lyrics dedicated to
  corporate pigs as Sarah says. One of her first experimental songs
  after "Touch". Home: 5/5 - this is also another good song,
  probably the 3rd I love. I just love how the song ends. It
  actually sounds better live since the instruments overlap her
  singing. Mercy: 5/5 - I consider this the last song from the
  album. WYLLH doesn't do it for me and I'm disappointed Sarah let
  Arista have it their way. Oh well. Sarah should do more
  acapella-like songs! This truly displayed her skills and got even
  better in the next album ;) Overall rating: 9.5/10 Outstanding
  album I wish it had more praise</Text>
  <Text category="music">This album came out about 8 years before I
  was born. All the years, I still remember turning on the classic
  radio stations that would play WBSS or Billie Jean. Now I know
  all the lyrics and music videos from this album. This is MJ in
  his prime. Unfortunately, we will never get another epic like
  this again. Michael is sadly a target in the media, but he is
  still a great music icon whether you like him or not. Every song
  off here is a classic. One song I thought was unneccesary was
  "Baby Be Mine". But otherwise, it's excellent. If you starting an
  MJ collection, get this album first. Trust me.</Text>
  <Text category="music">Hiphop as a genre is so wide spread and
  international that sometimes we get wonderful creative jems like
  Lady Sovereign. She is not only lyrically impressive, but the
  mixes of electronics on all her tracks will get you moving, which
  is basically what she sets out to do. I dont know much about the
  hip hop insprised grime scene in the UK, but i will definitely be
  keeping on eye out now. And i will patiently await for S.O.V.
  debut US album. Favorite Track, though all of it is really good,
  will have to be "The Battle" feature other grime scene artists
  like Shystie, Zuz Rock, and Frost P spitting the wildest (barely
  understandable lol) rhymes ive heard. No men and women have
  battled against each other like this, especially for the
  listening public. How ever, no one should compare SOV to anyone
  (Missy or M.I.A.) All emcees, particularly female one have a
  different style and should be prasied for such. SOV has a style
  totally different from anything ive heard to date. It's
  refreashing to see a new spin on HipHop.</Text>
  <Text category="music">Yes, there may be some small issues with
  the sound quality, but you get used to it, and Wilhelm Kempff is
  definitely one of the great pianists of the 20th Century, so it
  is worth it. These are incredible performances that are often
  justly called definitive. Kempff seems to always bring out every
  theme of every work and magnifies its emotional intensity,
  whereas other pianists would not have nearly as much attention to
  detail and neglect many subtle themes. Highly recommended</Text>
  <Text category="music">Kate is one of the most talented musicians
  on this earth. The Dreaming was underrated when it was first
  released, but I think that has to do with the fact that it was
  way ahead of its time. This is a superb album, tracks like Sat in
  Your Lap, Suspended in Gaffa, Leave It Open, Night of The
  Swallow, Houdini, and Get Out of My House proving this point.
  There's lots of anger on this album, as Kate put it herself many
  years ago, and it is her "darkest" effort to date, but it's pure
  brilliance! Buy it and be convinced.....</Text>

  pop-rock star Ritchie Valens, was released. The film cast Lou
  Diamond Phillips as the classic musician, and told his story,
  from his rise to fame, right down to his young and tragic death.
  For the film, Los Lobos, a fairly popular act of the day, was
  asked to rerecord classic Valens material for the movie. Some
  other moderately popular musicians who portrayed other musicians
  of the same era depicted in the film also provided recordings for
  the film. So, how is the soundtrack? Read on, and find out!
  OVERVIEW: The La Bamba soundtrack was released in 1987, around
  the same time as the film of the same name. Contributors to the
  soundtrack include Los Lobos, Howard Huntsberry, Marshall
  Crenshaw, Brian Setzer, and Bo Diddley. The A-Side of the
  soundtrack sonsists of the Los Lobos covers of the Ritchie Valens
  songs La Bamba, Come On Lets Go, Ooh My Head, We Belong Together,
  Framed, and Donna. The B-Side consists of the other artists'
  covers, which include Howard Huntsberry's cover of Jackie
  Wilson's Lonely Teardrops, Marshall Crenshaw's cover of Buddy
  Holly's Crying Waiting Hoping, Brian Setzer's cover of Eddie
  Cochran's Summertime Blues, Bo Diddley's remake of his own
  classic tune Who Do You Love, and the two songs Los Lobos
  recorded for the film which were not remakes, Charlena and
  Goodnight My Love. REVIEW: Awesome movie, awesome soundtrack. I'm
  a huge fan of the music of Ritchie Valens, and for the most part,
  La Bamba proved to be an efficient and entertaining retelling of
  the Valens saga. Aside from some omitted material (which I'll get
  to later), the soundtrack is every bit as good as the film it
  represents. Read on for my reviews of the tracks. -SIDE A- -La
  Bamba by Los Lobos: Los Lobos covers the track that took Ritchie
  Valens to the top of the musical world. Being a folk song, no one
  ever thought a rock and roll version would do well - Valens
  proved the non-believers wrong! Los Lobos does a great cover of
  it, too. The band actually did two versions of the song for the
  movie - a rendition of the slower, folksier version by the bar
  band that convinced Valens to cover the song himself, as well as
  the classic version Valens did. This is the classic Valens
  version. I wish they had included both versions of the
  soundtrack, though (although an instrumental sequence near the
  end of this version DOES reprise elements of the folk-type
  version. Still, I wanted BOTH versions as complete, separate
  tracks!) -Come On Lets Go by Los Lobos: This classic
  rockabilly-style cut was another huge hit for Ritchie Valens. Los
  Lobos creates a fine rendition of the classic cut, staying true
  to the Valens original while at the same time adding their own
  spin onto things. All in all, another great song. -Ooh My Head by
  Los Lobos: Not much to say about this one. Once again, Los Lobos
  manages to create an excellent version of one of the many classic
  Valens tunes people know and love him for. Every song on this
  soundtrack is excellent, and this one is no exception. -We Belong
  Together by Los Lobos: Ah, the classic Valens love song. Although
  its success was pretty much ousted by the better known ballad
  Donna, this one was still a fairly notable hit for Valens. The
  Los Lobos take on the ballad is a damn good one - but I shouldn't
  have to tell you that, now should I? -Framed by Los Lobos: Of all
  of the Ritchie Valens song that Los Lobos revisited in La Bamba,
  this one is the least well known. That's a shame, because it's a
  great song! The song takes a classic blues styling, and puts a
  rockabilly spin on it. Once again, Los Lobos does a marvelous
  cover version of the song. -Donna by Los Lobos: This song was so
  big a hit for Ritchie Valens initially, that his only song even
  on the same plane of popularity is La Bamba. The classic ode
  Valens wrote to his high school girlfriend proved to be the stuff
  that has withstood the test of time. And I know you're probably
  getting tired of me saying this for every song, but Los Lobos
  really does a good job on here. -SIDE B- -Lonely Teardrops by
  Howard Huntsberry: In La Bamba, Howard Huntsberry portrayed the
  classic soul singer Jackie Wilson. And here, Huntsberry reprises
  Wilson's signature tune. This is classic soul at its very best.
  Prior to seeing La Bamba, I had never even heard of Huntsberry.
  But the real shocker is that I ended up liking this version of
  the song more than the original! Definitely a solid, underrated
  cut. -Crying Waiting Hoping by Marshall Crenshaw: Marshall
  Crenshaw, a fairly popular eighties pop signer, managed to land
  the role of Buddy Holly in La Bamba. Holly, of course, was killed
  in the same plane crash that claimed the life of Ritchie Valens.
  Buddy Holly is a tough guy to cover, but Marshall Crenshaw does a
  damn good job of it. I personally prefer this version over
  Holly's original (and that's saying a lot since I LOVE Buddy
  Holly!) If you're interested in hearing Crenshaw cover another
  Holly tune, check out the remastered version of his 1982
  self-titled debut - he covers Rave On on there as a bonus track.
  -Summertime Blues by Brian Setzer: Long before Brian Setzer
  gained any real fame, he played Eddie Cochran in La Bamba,
  covering the song that made that man a rockabilly legend. Here's
  another one of those covers that is so good, I like it more than
  the original. Definitely worthwhile listening - but then again,
  isn't every song on here? -Who Do You Love by Bo Diddley: Bo
  Diddley himself did this song originally so very long ago, and
  was asked to rerecord it for La Bamba. He did, and the end
  results are solid. Diddley is a legend of the blues, and this
  recording is just a small sample of why so many people feel that
  way. It just a shame that the version of this song most people
  remember is the George Thorogood one, because Diddley's version
  is the song the way it was meant to be heard. -Charlena by Los
  Lobos: In addition to the Ritchie Valens covers, Los Lobos
  recorded two new songs for the La Bamba soundtrack. This is the
  first of the two. Essentially, this here is a neo-rockabilly
  track of sorts, and a damn good one too. Long after the fifties
  music scene died out, Los Lobos still managed to record a song
  that suited the style perfectly. -Goodnight My Love by Los Lobos:
  Here's the second of the newly-recorded Los Lobos songs done for
  the soundtrack. What we have here is one of those classic
  fifties-style rock ballads that were so popular back then. If
  you're into that sort of thing, you're going to love this song -
  I know I do! -OTHER COMMENTS- Omissions are the biggest problem
  with this soundtrack, by far. As I previously stated, only one
  version of La Bamba is on here - not both versions from the film.
  Another omission is Sleepwalk, the classic Santo And Johnny
  instrumental that shows up frequently in the film. Its omission
  is likely due to the fact that it wasn't recorded just for the
  film, but still, I miss it. And then there's the issue of Rip It
  Up, the classic Ritchie Valens rockabilly tune he first plays
  with his band in their garage, early on in the film. This was one
  of my favorite songs in the film, and I was devastated not to see
  it on here. And where's the Big Bopper's Chantilly Lace? I rated
  this soundtrack four stars instead of five because of omissions.
  If these songs had been on here, it would be five stars all the
  way. OVERALL: Overall, despite my issues with the omitted songs,
  I am very satisfied with the La Bamba soundtrack. Much like the
  movie, it's an excellent experience all the way through. If you
  liked the movie, or you're just into this sort of music, the
  soundtrack is well worth owning. Highly recommended! EDITION
  NOTES: This soundtrack is becoming increasingly more difficult to
  find on compact disc, implying it may be very gradually going out
  of print. Take my advice - if you want it, just buy it online.
  It's the fastest, easiest way to get it.</Text>
  <Text category="music">When I first heard this album I was a bit
  shocked. Myself and my fellow TMBG fans derided it as a "teen
  angst album," moaned and whined that John &amp;amp; John had
  betrayed us by adding a band, and generally refused to give it a
  chance. A few years later, listening to my entire collection of
  TMBG in chonological order (a sanity-restoration ritual), I
  realized that this album is AWESOME! There are only 2 stupid
  songs, Window and DirtBike. Hey, for TMBG, that's not bad - their
  fans forgive them stupidity on a regular basis. Aside from that,
  there are more rockin', thought-provoking tunes here than you'll
  find almost anywhere. This album establishes beyond a doubt that
  TMBG are among the most gifted songwriters in rock history. I'm
  not going to go over each individual song - there are millions of
  TMBG fans who have and will. I will add my 2 cents about my 4
  favorites however: "I Should be Allowed to Think" - TMBG does
  justice to beat poetry, and beyond! "Why Must I Be Sad?" - Funny
  and pissy, great for getting those pesky emotions unstuck. The
  lyrics are genius, subtly quoting the best of Alice Cooper with
  tongue firmly planted in cheek. "A Self Called Nowhere" -
  Righteous, angry, and breathtaking. Angsty punk bands of the
  world, take note: you will NEVER be this hardcore. "The End of
  the Tour" - I have written in my last wishes that I want this one
  played at my funeral. One of the most moving and emotionally
  honest rock ballads ever written. If your idea of TMBG is songs
  like "Istanbul" and "Particle Man," get over it! And give this
  album a chance!</Text>
  <Text category="music">So many times, older recordings are not
  very high quality but not with this group of songs. If you are a
  Marty Robbins fan (and I am) this CD is a must</Text>
  <Text category="music">ALL I CAN SAY IS YOU MUST TRY THIS!</Text>
  <Text category="music">I am a big Ambrosia fan and I love
  "Biggest Part of Me", "You're the Only Woman", "How Much I Feel"
  and the newer track "I Just Can't Let Go". However, I wish this
  CD contained all of their Billboard Hot 100 hits. The CD is
  missing their cover of "Magical Mystery Tour" (#39) and "How Can
  You Love Me" (#86). For the casual listener, this CD is perfect.
  For the chart hit completionists out there, it misses a couple
  songs. I bought this CD used for $1.99, which was a HUGE bargain
  for the songs included. For that price, I can certainly try to
  download the missing tracks</Text>
  <Text category="music">i just want to say that this record blows
  my mind! Only the japanese could come up with this musical hybrid
  that defies definition. Only miss minekawa could inject such
  beautiful innocence into this thrilling aural rollercoaster of
  breaks, samples, and guitars. Cornelius and DJ Me DJ You are
  brilliant</Text>
  <Text category="music">I'm a bit surprised by the negative
  reviews, this CD is amazing. It's not anything like Soundgarden
  or Audioslave - but it's amazing none-the-less. Every song on
  here is beautifully written, and, as always, Cornell's voice
  doesn't disappoint. It's different, but one of my new favorite
  CDs</Text>
  <Text category="music">When my boyfriend bought this for me I was
  so happy and I remember I would play this music and sing for him
  in the car on cool dark, starry nights and I would be mesmerized
  not only by the intensity of those nights, but by the music she
  sang and how she deeply, richly portrayed those songs. She really
  knew how to set the mood for any lover or lonely lover as well. I
  totally recommend this CD to start if you have not heard much of
  her music...SHe truly is addicting once you hear these
  songs...These songs will definetly put you in an enchanting and
  romantic journey</Text>
  <Text category="music">If you are expecting "Safari Moon Pt. 2",
  you will be dissapointed. Air took a more adventuourous, darker,
  ambient, serious, experimental, and ultimtately brilliant journey
  into electronic music. The songs here range from sounding like
  Aphex Twin (without the weird off-putting effects or heavy drums)
  to Thievery Corp. Air still has a beautiful sense of melody and
  as usual the tunes themselves are beautifully and creatively put
  together (even a throwaway Air song is a well-crafted one).
  Overall, all us true hardcore Air fans love this album. Those who
  only loved MS may not like it, but that's their loss I say</Text>
  <Text category="music">If you do not yet own Dark Side of the
  Moon, Wish You Were Here AND The Wall, do not even consider
  purchasing A Momentary Lapse of Reason. AMLOR is junk by
  comparison. That said, very few rock albums ever made can hang
  with those three, and AMLOR certainly has its bright spots.
  "Learning to Fly" and "On the Turning Away" are as good as
  anything Pink Floyd has ever produced. Some of the other songs
  are adequate, but this album does not contain the front-to-back
  brillance of the earlier Floyd releases. It's definitely worth
  having, but make sure that you have the others first.</Text>
  <Text category="music">This album is the foudation of modern Hip
  Hop...the format of the album the presence of Rakim ....his image
  everything was new territory when this album came out in 86' all
  Hip Hop lovers should have this album especially people down
  south</Text>
  <Text category="music">Considering how much bad music is out
  there these days, this was nice to come across. Covers a wide
  range of topics and moods, musicianship is pretty good. I'd
  recommend it to just about anyone. My tastes are usually heavier
  and more progressive - Rush, Dream Theater, Iron Maiden,
  Queensryche. But I like this disc too</Text>
  <Text category="music">It's impossible to like all of country
  music, but Randy Travis is liked by even those who don't like
  country music. From 1986 and through the 90's he was always on
  top or near the top of the country charts. His calm, nasal drawl
  reminds me a bit of Lefty Frizell, but there's no mistaking his
  unique style. These are some of the best recordings in the
  history of country music including Digging Up Bones, Forever and
  Ever, Amen, Too Gone Too Long, Is It Still Over?, Hard Rock
  Bottom Of Your Heart etc. Randy had 16 No. 1's on the country
  charts. There are 20 cuts here. If you only want one CD with all
  his greatest hits this is your logical choice. By the way, the
  sound from Rhino is bright and punchy and the booklet features
  dates, neat pixs, and peak positions. You've got a winner for
  life with this one!</Text>
  <Text category="music">Good singing and Good Production must I
  say anything else?.....No get this if you love mixtures of good
  uptempo and slow Rn</Text>
  <Text category="music">This is mood making, sexy, great music.
  Neal adds a slight rock edge to some beautiful and familiar
  melodies. This album is great for background music (we play it in
  our store), party music or just for listing. One of the best
  guitar players of all time 'sings' with his instrument. BUY IT
  NOW</Text>
  <Text category="music">I personally like this compilation of
  Prince, it's got most of the songs I like and the sound is great.
  Sure, there could have been a few more songs included, like "Pop
  Life", "Hot Thing", but when compared to the other compilations,
  this disc has more of the songs that are a must-have, for me,
  such as "I Wanna Be Your Lover", which I don't think was included
  on any of the other compilations. So, it's just a matter of
  weighing what songs you most want, so that's why I chose this
  disc and I'm glad I did!</Text>
  <Text category="music">I owned the album as a kid.......I enjoy
  it as much now as I did then</Text>
  <Text category="music">For the longest time, I have thought that
  observational truths were highly prone to being the most piercing
  of things: I have believed that the truth could either hurt (or
  disturb) you terribly, or make you laugh so hard, to the point of
  hysteria--or a combination of both extremes. There are many
  things to put this theory to the test, but to cut it all short,
  all one would need to do (if by chance it hasn't been done
  already) is experience the observational humor of Richard Pryor
  to possibly get a better understanding of what I am talking
  about. This classic comedy album from 1975 is a prime example.
  Richard Pryor has been hailed as a genius by many, and I would
  have to agree: it takes plenty of intelligence and natural talent
  to be a comedian for starters, but to also turn many disturbing
  observational truths of everyday life into something painfully,
  body-breakingly hilarious takes a whole lot of something as well.
  From the very beginning, to the tail-end of this CD, 1975's _Is
  It Something I Said?_ is a non-stop laugh fest, that personally
  gets *me* laughing so loud and hard, I end up pretty much abusing
  almost every part of my body in the process: my throat, my lungs,
  my sides, my stomach--they all end up feeling beaten and
  worn-out. Richard's takes on drugs, sex, race &amp;amp; racism,
  relationships, and politics in general are every bit as painfully
  observational as they are profane--and did I mention HILARIOUS?
  The racy quality of the material found here makes so much of
  what's referred to as "cutting-edge" these days, seem so
  contrived and unaffecting; Richard's observations seem just as
  relevant now--if not more so--as they were 30 years ago. I
  couldn't be graphic in pointing out some of the sickeningly funny
  moments on this disc -- and there are MANY -- but I should say
  that the opening one-two punch of "Eulogy," and "Shortage of
  White People," and Richard's take on his own battle with cocaine
  addiction in the "Cocaine" bit get me cracking up SO
  hysterically, I sometimes need to be careful not to make myself
  sick. And again, those are just a few of the MANY hysterical
  blasts found here. Richard Pryor is considered a comedic legend
  for a reason. This album here is a good example as to why he is
  considered as such. Just don't play it for the kids, and for the
  love of god *don't* play it during the middle of the night; you
  most certainly will disturb the beauty rest of your family, and
  your neighbors. And you know what could happen if you disturb one
  person's beauty rest: just imagine what would happen if you
  disturbed the beauty rest of many..</Text>
  <Text category="music">I think this my first EP purchase ever -
  and I generally feel that, despite the quality many offer, EPs
  just are not worth it. Sam Beam was clearly on a mission to
  change my mind, as these apparent "outtakes" from The Creek Drank
  The Cradle are every bit as good as that miracle debut - if not
  better. I only very recently discovered Iron and Wine through Our
  Endless Numbered Days, and have since been backtracking only to
  see that this remarkably talented artist can do no wrong. The
  standout track to me is The Night Descending, it has the feel of
  a track pulled right out of the past. The other four tracks are
  just as excellent though, and I think Sam's managed to make an
  avid fan out of me. Damn... and just when I thought there were no
  new artists to be excited about!</Text>
  <Text category="music">"Horizon" was a turning point in the
  recording career of the Carpenters--a more sophisticated sound
  more suited to Karen's rich and warm voice. But the album was
  rather short, and some of the songs just weren't up to the
  standards expected by their fans, which was reflected in the
  sales of the album, which was their slowest selling album up to
  that point. The opening "Aurora" and the closing "Eventide" (The
  same melody with different lyrics) nicely bookend the album, and
  Aurora provides the first hint that this was not the average
  Carpenters album. "Only Yesterday" follows; this beautiful and
  uptempo song begins as a dolorous, downbeat ballad before
  segueing into the cheerful refrain. The cover of "Desperado" is
  well done, but ultimately it is lost between the flashy tracks
  before and after it. "Please Mr. Postman" is infectuously happy
  fluff; it has absolutely no depth, but is irresistable while it's
  playing and will have you singing along with Karen. The big-band
  era "I Can Dream, Can't I?" reveals the new depths of Karen's
  voice, and the small jazz combo ensures that she is the focus of
  the listener. The third and final single from this album,
  "Solitaire" begins the second half of the album on a
  (metaphorical) high note. The remaining full tracks ("Happy","I'm
  Caught Between Goodbye and I Love You", and "Love Me for What I
  Am") are all less-than-captivating songs that greatly benefit
  from Karen's reading and Richard's arrangements</Text>
  <Text category="music">I received "Aerial" last December, and it
  still amazes me. The music soars and sweeps, carrying the
  listener along on its wings. It is a work of genius, and those
  who are long-time Kate Bush fans will find that it was well worth
  waiting twelve years for this masterpiece to arrive! This
  two-disc set offers the listener two different experiences, in my
  opinion. The first disc, "A Sea of Honey" is comprised of sort of
  stand alone pieces, first of which is "King of the Mountain,"
  probably the most "commercially appealing" song on the album.
  "King of the Mountain" sucks the listener in with deep, murky
  tones and Kate's voice easing into the song softly, building in
  intensity as the song progresses. "King of the Mountain" is
  followed by songs like "Pi" (who else but Kate Bush could make
  the derivation of Pi sound so sexy?) and "Bertie," a lovely
  Elizabethan paean to her young son. Then there are emotionally
  raw songs like "Mrs. Bartolozzi" and "A Coral Room," the latter
  of which is about Kate's late Mother. The reclusive Ms. Bush
  teases the listener about the struggle for anonymity in "How to
  Be Invisible," and sings in reference to Joan of Arc in "Joanni."
  After being captivated by songs about famous people, and more
  down-to-earth personal struggles/triumphs, the listener comes to
  the second disc, titled "A Sky of Honey." This is, in my opinion,
  the pi&#239;&#191;&#189;ce de r&#239;&#191;&#189;sistance of
  "Aerial." This disc is a continuous journey of sound, taking the
  listener on an amazing voyage punctuated by--among other
  things--the sounds of birds, the sound of her child's voice, and
  Kate Bush's silky voice singing in Italian. The disc is almost
  indescribably beautiful, in my opinion. I love the way "A Sky of
  Honey" takes me out of myself when I hear it. I feel like I am
  flying at points; becoming one with the soaring birds. My
  personal favorite on "A Sky of Honey" is "Nocturn," a surreal
  nighttime romp on the beach, accompanied by thumping bass and
  showcasing the pure magic of Kate Bush's voice. The disc's final
  (and title) track "Aerial" is a forceful climax to the sonic
  journey, and ends with Bush singing: "I want to be up on the roof
  I've gotta be up on the roof Up, up high on the roof Up, up on
  the roof In the sun" It is as though Kate Bush has reached new
  heights and has taken the listener along for the trip. What an
  absolutely magnificent acheievement this disc is! To Kate Bush
  fans, I cannot recommend this album highly enough. True, it was a
  very long wait for this new CD, but, Ms. Bush has rewarded her
  fans duly; indeed it is almost like she released two separate
  albums at once with this two-disc triumph! If you are a Kate Bush
  devotee, you will not be disappointed! And, if you are new to
  Kate Bush, "Aerial" will be a great introduction to her genius.
  Kate Bush is like no other artist I can name. Her voice is
  incredibly versatile; she can mold it to sound like an angel or a
  banshee, a temptress or a child. And, so far in her career, it
  Kate Bush's voice gets better with the passing of time. Like a
  fine wine, one can savor it and contemplate its complexities
  endlessly. "Aerial" is well, well worth listening to, and words
  alone cannot suffice to explain what a work of art it is.</Text>
  <Text category="music">First, I'd like to say that I am so glad
  there are artists like Amel around who aren't trying to fit in
  with today's commercial R&amp;amp;B scene. As a long time fan of
  R&amp;amp;B and soul music I can't help but feel sad and
  dissapointed at the direction the genre is taking, especially in
  regards to female singers. She may be beautiful, but she doesn't
  need to use her looks to overcompensate for any lack of vocal
  talent by flaunting herself. Amel has a beautiful soul, and you
  can hear that through her wonderful voice and lyrics. Every song
  on this album has at some point or another touched me, some songs
  straight away while others grew on me slowly. You know how
  sometimes when you're listening to music and a particular lyric
  or vocal piece makes you shiver? Amel's got that down for me. I
  was firstly introduced to nusoul by Teedra Moses, someone who
  I've admired for two years now, and who to me seemed one of the
  few decent R&amp;amp;B singers left. Through Teedra I stumbled on
  Amel's "Bravebird" and became more and more curious as I listened
  to the album over and over. Like with most nu/soul, the love I
  have for each song grew slowly, and songs I thought weren't for
  me suddenly became my favorites on the album. I love that about
  Amel; she makes me suprise myself, as I become emotionally
  involved with her music and voice over time until I'm enchanted.
  "For Real" hit me instantly as a beautiful song. I never get
  tired of it's cute opening where Amel's daughter babbles
  something in baby talk! I'd love to talk about each song
  individually, but I'd probably just bore you. To me Amel's music
  is a personal experience, and most likely strikes people in
  different ways. I will mention however, "Congo" - one of the
  songs on there I was tempted to skip at first but has fast become
  something of an obsession which crops into my head throughout the
  days, with it's monotonous jungle vibe. Other personal favorites
  include "We Can Be New", "Say You Want It", "All I Got2"... Hell
  the whole album really. Along with other outstanding artists of
  the nu-soul genre, Amel has succesfully metamorphosised my taste
  in back music. Trust me, you'll never go back to commercial
  R&amp;amp;B again</Text>
  <Text category="music">Overdrive, watching the rain, Enchanted,
  Teaching myself to dream, Glow, Lemon, Because I can are really
  excellent songs, this album is really worth it.</Text>
  <Text category="music">This is where AFI began their sound change
  from their first 2 cd's (answer that &amp;amp; stay fashionable,
  Very Proud of Ya). It is much more serious than the first 2, alot
  angrier, heavier, Darker, and more screaming/yelling as well.
  Some people say this is their best, I disagree, I prefer their
  "punkier" 1st 2 BUT i still enjoy this alot, it's all down to
  personal taste, it gets a 5/5 for me</Text>
  <Text category="music">I have just about all of Robben's albums
  and I believe that this is his best work. The interpretations and
  musicianship are outstanding. Robben's improvisational playing
  actually comes across more like composition. His technique is
  extremely melodic. He is, in my opinion, one the best blues
  guitar players around and his profound knowledge of jazz gives
  his music a very refreshing &amp;amp;quot;twist&amp;amp;quot;.
  Check out his prowess on &amp;amp;quot;You cut me to the
  bone&amp;amp;quot;, &amp;amp;quot;Prison of love&amp;amp;quot; or
  &amp;amp;quot;My love will never die&amp;amp;quot;</Text>
  <Text category="music">Although I like this album, there's
  nothing that especially stands out about it. It's typical Bright
  Eyes, and if you already love the band you won't be disappointed.
  However, it's not one of their best albums. It's not as good as
  Lifted, not as addicting as Fevers and Mirrors, and not as raw
  and endearing as Letting off the Happiness. But yet again, Conor
  succeeds in writing songs that capture all of the emotion without
  making me ill in a Dashboard Confessional sort of way</Text>
  <Text category="music">I first encountered Bird3 opening for
  Veruca Salt the summer of 2001. That band had put their faith
  into Bird and so have I. We fell in love with them all together.
  This band has successfully combined infectious pop hooks with
  soul-baring lyrics to create something unique, beautiful, and far
  from most of the trite pop or rock music you hear on the radio
  today. You'll find yourself not only humming along, but holding
  this music close to your heart at your most intimate moments. You
  will not once regret buying this piece of art</Text>
  <Text category="music">Earlier, I had an LP called "Best of the
  Band" that was 10 cuts and maybe 35 minutes. This is 18 well
  chosen cuts and double the length. There are a lot of "best
  of/greatest hits" type collections from veteran artists that
  originally came out in 70's or early 80's that had a limited
  number of songs and length. This IS a case where the record
  decided to offer more songs and give the customer a better value
  for their money. The music itself is 5 stars and they were a
  major artist due to the fact that they had 3 very good but very
  different lead vocalists handling the vocals. It gives the music
  a lot more variety and they put out a lot of fine music in their
  1968-76 prime. As an aside, 3 of the Band members (Helm, Danko,
  and Hudson) also put out some good music in the 1990's</Text>
  <Text category="music">This album is great but I'm looking for a
  song that I think they sung. It goes: Pressing on we're pressing
  on (repeat). Waiting on Jesus to answer our call we're holding on
  (repeat) Pressing, pressing, pressing. If anyone knows the name
  of the song, or has any suggestions on who sings this song,
  please email me at udeebear1984@yahoo.com. Thank you and have a
  blessed day! :</Text>
  <Text category="music">Hot Hot Heat is one of the few new bands
  to pique my interest. Their first release was decent, but
  "Elevator" is even better. Great tunes, drums and guitars - and,
  of course, Steve Bays' yelping vocals. There's only three songs I
  really don't care for - "Pickin' It Up", "Soldier In A Box" and
  "Shame On You". Looking forward to the next CD</Text>
  <Text category="music">I used to be a bigger fan of Joe Satriani
  than Steve Vai about 10 years ago. Now I quickly get bored of new
  Satriani albums, but Vai's music just moves me. Lotus feet for
  example, wow, words cannot describe what that song does to me.
  Thanks Steve</Text>
  <Text category="music">I'm a fan of Three 6 Mafia, and I can say
  maybe they kinda got a little of Three 6's rap style in this
  album, but I dunno. DJ Paul and Juicy J, the superproducers, they
  can never be beaten. I got all the Hypnotize Minds albums and
  they did invent crunk music. Many people haven't heard of them
  cuz besides Ridin' Spinners and Chickenhead they haven't been
  played on the radio very much except for their new track "Poppin'
  My Collar." Crime Mob's alright. The beats are alright, but
  nothing compared to Three 6 Mafia. Some of them are some krunk
  songs, I can get hyped to a few of them. But other than that I
  dunno. The lyrics are rather simple, I'm an 18 year old white
  dude and I think I can put together some better bars than these
  dudes can. But they do get some major play up here in Virginia.
  Stilletos and Knuck if you Buck haven't gotten some airtime. But
  there's only like 4 songs total that are worth hearing. I guess
  we'll see if they put out another album or not. I think if they
  had some other fellas from Georgia like T.I. or Jeezy or
  something they might get some more hype. Who knows, since Paul
  Wall's on every song now maybe he'll make a cameo. I guess we'll
  see. Three 6 Mafia still the buckest and besides their new artist
  Chrome, who really is garbage, they are still the kings of crunk,
  not Lil' John</Text>
  <Text category="music">if you do not own this album you must get
  your hand on a copy. It is the best debut album since definatly
  mayby. Tracks like &amp;amp;quot;golden touch&amp;amp;quot;
  &amp;amp;quot;V.I.C.E&amp;amp;quot; well lets just say every song
  on the album is a bonnifide hit including the
  banging&amp;amp;quot;stumbble and fall&amp;amp;quot; which will
  have you tapping your toes from the first 2 seconds. If you like
  the libretines or the others or are just looking for a solid cd
  this is a must have</Text>

  <Text category="music">The earlier reviews pretty much said it
  all; this is pretty much one of THE best and most overlooked
  bands from the 90s. Swervedriver is lumped into the shoegazer
  category often, however, if that label scares you off then
  dismiss its application to this band, because they aren't so much
  shoegazer - in that cough-syrup-dreamy-noise way - as they are
  sonic rock. Yes, rock. Who knew it could still be done, and
  believe me, they do it well, and uniquely. If you've listened to
  Swervedriver before, then tehre isn't too much more to say - buy
  this album. It's not as hi-fi as 99th Dream or Mezcal Head (in my
  opinion their best album and one of the best of 90s decade), but
  not as fast or dirty as Raise. Now, if you have never listened to
  Swervedriver, this might not be the best album to start with - it
  all depends on your tastes. Personally, I would suggest starting
  with 99th Dream or Mezcal Head; either way, this has all the
  qualities of every Swervedriver album - great lyrics, superb and
  unique songs, and that urge for more when it's over. Sadly, this
  band was vastly ill-treated by labels and they are no longer
  together (however, some vestiges exist in the form of Toshack
  Highway). But if you want to see what you missed in the 90s -
  even more so, if you want to see what the best of the best from
  that decade truly was - Swervedriver is a must</Text>
  <Text category="music">Every thing he sings is perfect, I've yet
  to find one song that doesn't move me. This CD has some beauties.
  &amp;amp;quot;Daughter of Mine&amp;amp;quot; is priceless.
  &amp;amp;quot;Steal Away&amp;amp;quot; is very nice.
  &amp;amp;quot;One Small Star&amp;amp;quot; brings tears. This
  arrangement of &amp;amp;quot;Voyage&amp;amp;quot; is probably the
  best I've heard. His traditional songs (&amp;amp;quot;When you
  and I were young Maggie&amp;amp;quot; and &amp;amp;quot;Mary of
  Argyle&amp;amp;quot;) are beautiful. I can't find anything on
  this CD I couldn't listen to for hours. I truly love music and
  listen to it constantly. I find myself reaching for the McDermott
  CD's almost exclusively. I have them all, more please</Text>
  <Text category="music">Kudos to Harvey Fierstein for being so
  true to the Jean Poiret play. Jerry Herman did a wonderful score

  <Text category="music">Hey!....It's Johnny Cash! You can't go
  wrong purchasing anything by Johnny Cash.</Text>
  <Text category="music">This CD offers a great deal of incredible
  music by John Lennon during 1969 and the early 1970's when he
  fought our government in order for him and Yoko to live in the
  United States. The quality of the music is excellent and after
  you listen to this CD you want to run to watch the film! The CD
  starts off strong with "Power To The People." The song makes its
  political statement and offers a great beat that sticks in your
  mind. It is also very upbeat and aggressive in its tone which
  attracts the listener immediately to make them want more. The
  listener won't be disappointed. The tracks that follow provide
  great insight into John's politics at the same time that he
  provides us with his singularly beautiful music. Great songs on
  this CD include the autobiographical "Nobody Told Me" in which
  John admits that his struggle with our government both to end the
  Vietnam War and to remain in the USA is harder than he thought it
  would be. "Working Class Hero" has a folksy, bluesy feel to it
  but then the CD goes right back to that unique John Lennon rock
  and roll flavor with the song "I Found Out." "Bed Peace" follows
  as a type of introduction to the only Beatles song on this CD,
  "The Ballad Of John &amp;amp; Yoko." Despite the catchy rock and
  roll beat to "The Ballad Of John &amp;amp; Yoko," the lyrics tell
  the sad story of how people harass John and Yoko. Another great
  song is "Give Peace A Chance;" the message here is obvious.
  "Love," "Imagine," and "Oh My Love" are beautiful ballads with
  excellent musical arrangements; and we get a new instrumental
  version of "How Do You Sleep" that is very well done. In
  addition, I like the two live tracks from the John Sinclair
  Freedom Rally in 1971. "Attica State" is a brand new release and
  "John Sinclair" packs a strong punch! These tracks demonstrate so
  well John's ability to connect with his audience in a live
  setting. One special song on this CD directly challenges each and
  every listener to personal reflection and insight: "Happy Xmas
  (War Is Over)." John and Yoko tell people to know the difference
  between the blessings of peace and the evils of war, to cherish
  what is morally right and to fight against anything that is
  morally wrong. The song also expresses hope for a peaceful future
  beyond the current Christmas season. "Happy Xmas (War Is Over)"
  continues to play on radio stations every Christmas season to
  this day. Yes, another Amazon reviewer correctly notes that Yoko
  talks a little bit over the very beginning of the song "Oh My
  Love." Thank goodness that she doesn't talk over the lyrics! A
  few brief dialogue excerpts from the film are peppered throughout
  the CD but they never overlap with the songs. The CD ends with
  the same strength that it started with: "Instant Karma! (We All
  Shine On)" is an excellent song that most Lennon fans will always
  love. The liner notes include some great black and white pictures
  of John and Yoko, including two from the infamous "bed-in." You
  get the song credits along with the year that each song was
  released and there is a brief essay by Yoko Ono herself. Overall,
  this CD is more than just a retrospective of John's music during
  a turbulent period in his life. Oh sure, almost all of this music
  has been previously released. However, that's not relevant here.
  The CD celebrates Lennon's ability to communicate his political
  beliefs through his songs. These songs remind us to avoid
  genocide, to be true to oneself and to strive for peace--now. I
  highly recommend this CD for Lennon fans, fans of great 1970s
  rock music and anyone who wants to experience how John Lennon
  taught us what was right through his music.</Text>
  <Text category="music">This is one of my all-time favorite CDs. I
  loved all the songs on this CD except one. My favorite is "Black
  Girl Pain" and it should be an anthem and inspriration for Black
  women all over the globe. I had the pleasure of seeing Talib in
  concert a few months ago in Atlanta and his live show was even
  better than his CD. True Hip-hop lives</Text>
  <Text category="music">In the early 60's Etta James was to
  R&amp;amp;amp;B what Patsy Cline was to country. She could cross
  over and yet remain true to her roots, and that's only one part
  of a nearly 50 year career! From the velvety cross over soul of
  &amp;amp;quot;At Last&amp;amp;quot; to the hard driving Memphis
  soul of &amp;amp;quot;Tell Mama&amp;amp;quot;, this is one legend
  who certainly deserves a wider audience than she has today. She
  ranks right up with Aretha Franklin as an influential vocalist. I
  took far too many years to discover her power. If you haven't
  given her a serious look yet, stop wasting time and begin
  here</Text>
  <Text category="music">This guy is going to become big someday. I
  agree with this reviewer: "The songs on "Seven Swans", with a
  folksy bucholic feeling that runs through most of them, tell of
  spiritual tales. They tell of love that transcends the body and
  age. Sufjan can appeal equally to the Christian person as to the
  one who practices Zen Buddhism. And that is something few
  songwriters can accomplish. Keep an eye on Sufjan for years to
  come." I have fun tooling around with "To Be Alone with You" on
  the guitar, such a simple but infectious melody. "SEVEN SWANS" is
  not over orchestrated like "Michigan" and "Illinois" seem to be.
  Good song to OK song ratio is about 85 percent on this one and
  about 45-50 percent on the the aforementioned CD's. "SEVEN SWANS"
  is a great way to get introduced to the subtle musical power and
  overall genius of Sufjan. Sufjan has all his own style and is not
  afraid to tell us who he is. VERY CREATIVE...HE TRULY FORGES HIS
  OWN MUSICAL PATH. CANNOT WAIT FOR HIS CD CALLED
  "WISCONSIN."</Text>
  <Text category="music">Please do yourself a favor and buy this
  CD! Whatever you do, dont listen to it in your car though. No
  kidding aside, I almost ran my car off the road because I was
  laughing so hard</Text>
  <Text category="music">I INHALED this CD. After all the hype and
  hyper blowin' up about this dance/punk/rock genius, I finally
  broke down and bought it. Not that I was old enough to get into
  the discos in the mid 70's-early/mid 80's(I was still in
  elementary school, then middle school), but I remember(and still
  love) the groups that influenced this disc...The Buzzcocks,
  Heaven 17, PiL, Blondie...hell even the Rolling Stones "Some
  Girls" album. And yes, I have to say(after finding "Death
  Disco-Songs Under the Dance Floor 1978-1984" CD and I'm ordering
  it)the old stuff is more fun. But for the hipsters who don't know
  this is not original genre,it's pretty great. No, it's very
  great. The first song "Daft Punk is Playing at my House" was fun,
  and both discs made it worth driving through snowy/sleety/frozen
  rain covered streets to work out at the gym these last couple
  weeks</Text>
  <Text category="music">With a compelling story, great music,
  great lyrics, and two outstanding female leads, Aida certainly
  delievers. Right from the start with the goregous "Every Story Is
  A Love Story", the listener is captured by the wonderful spirit
  of the show. The seamless tranisition between ballads and
  showtunes is flawless. The three stars of the show each being
  something different to this recording. While Adam Pascal is
  always great, he's the weak point on this recording. I much more
  prefer him in Rent, and I don't think his voice suits this show
  very well. Sherie Renee Scott is teriffic as Amneris, and her
  powerful voice fills this recording with the powerful opener and
  "I Know the Truth". The star, however, is Heather Headley as
  Aida. Her Tony-winning performance will be forever immortalized
  on this recording with big, raw, emotional, and powerful voice.
  She's is perfect in every way</Text>
  <Text category="music">I love that garage days re-re visited is
  on the flip side...in the cassette I had warped a long time ago!
  I like this one</Text>
  <Text category="music">This was one of those rare performances
  where Dylan's raw energy swept the stage and transformed these
  selections from his collection into somthing entirely new and
  great. The sound is rough, the intonation is off, the recording
  is filled with horrible buzzes, whistles, and clicks. None of
  which matters. Once youe listened to some of the tracks on this
  disk, you'll prefer them to the original album cuts. I know I do.
  Absolutely essential to any collection of Dylan's work, "Hard
  Rain" is not to be missed.</Text>
  <Text category="music">ROCK N' ROLL history has many example of
  band/artists unlucky, that didn't get the recognition they
  deserve. Here's one. What is Big Star about? A rock n' roll,
  slightly psychodelic, most influenced by Beatles and The Byrds.
  the first record (#1 record - 1972) is the battle of two frontman
  putting one classic pop-rock tune after another. Chilton gets the
  most rock stuff, Chris the ballads, and also a contribution from
  Hummel, the hippy "India song". best moments: In the streets,
  thirteen, india song, when my baby's beside me, my life is right.
  the second album - Radio city - 1973. Chris left the band,
  claiming that Chilton was getting too much control of everything.
  For this record, Hummel contributes more, the band goes torward
  some stuff slightly different, like the soul intended O my soul
  (maybe a reflection of the record label atmosphere. Chilton here
  also takes full control of the musical direction, the albm sounds
  not better or worse, but less laboured, sounding in some tracks,
  more like a rehearsal, with a great garage feeling. Stevens goes
  great on drums, specally on Back of a car. best tracks: way out
  west, life is white (although the harmonica annoys me a little),
  mod lang (very bowie mood), back of a car, september gurls. At a
  glance, Big Star reminds me backing home from school,playing my
  guitar, calling my girlfriend on the phone and waiting for the
  weekend to go to the beach. A feeling of youthness that doesn't
  come back, just like those special moments in a band's career
  that later, they can't catch anymore, no matter how hard they
  try. For Big Star, no differ, they would never do anything like
  these two records. And sadly after Bell's death, chances are zero
  to none. Why didn't they succeeded. Well, ego stuff, lack of Stax
  knowledge to deal with rock n' roll bands, and the dicotomy that
  was ruling the rock n' roll scene at the time: Hard rock versus
  progressive rock. And what about Big Star? Neither hard rock, nor
  progressive. But, despite all that rubish, Big Star is pure rock
  n'roll, guitar band, 70's style, recognizable in many current
  bands recording all over the world. Big Star is eternal.</Text>
  <Text category="music">I purchased this album from Rasputina's
  website as soon as it was released there, and it stayed in my cd
  player (or technically, it stayed on repeat on my iPod) for a
  full fortnight after. It's full of the rock, groove, beauty, and
  madness that typefies the live Raspy experience. I HIGHLY
  recommend this cd to any fans who love to see the band live in
  recital, or who have not yet had the pleasure. If you don't have
  this recording, buy it now! Wait a minute... why don't you have
  it yet? The only reason I've given a rating of 4, rather than 5,
  is that I feel the sound quality could be a tad better in some
  spots; it can get a little murky. But for the most part, it
  sounds pretty good. I'll also mention, for anyone who doesn't
  know, that Zoe's latest solo cd is now available on her website,
  zoekeating.com. She's a wonderful artist in her own right - check
  it out!</Text>
  <Text category="music">For real, you gotta give this man props. I
  repect him and his music, but it's not my style. He still managed
  to make this a good album, so it's all good. Much repect.</Text>
  <Text category="music">For any seasoned fans of The Waifs (or
  anyone out there with a predilection for folksy girl duets
  sporting brilliant guitar skills and voices to boot), 'Shelter
  Me' will be no departure --and no disapointment -- from what
  you've heard before. The album weighs heavily on The Waifs
  accoustical appeal. The majority of the songs carry themselves
  without backbeat or excessive instrumentation -- mostly it's just
  the girls, their guitars, and the usual, typically wonderful
  songwriting that comes from Josh Cunningham, the third member of
  this stellar folk ensemble. The title track 'Shelter Me' is a
  gorgeous, magnificently charged piece that will leave you
  reeling, "Take me now where shelter be/ before there's nothing
  left of me." Vikki's final track 'Spotlight' is a pure gem,
  emotional and raw but utterly beautiful. 'Attention' finishes the
  album well with that familliar Waify energy and pulse, almost
  blue grass, almost country, but totally wonderful.</Text>
  <Text category="music">This album is a classic, but its really
  short. Dead prez are the best duo in rap in my opinion. i highly

  <Text category="music">Wow what a great cd. I'm a big music fan

  with this one. A</Text>
  <Text category="music">This is lovely stuff. The other reviews
  say why much better than I can, but I just had to add to the
  adoration</Text>
  <Text category="music">I love EVERY track on Ne-Yo's CD "in my
  own words!" Next let me thank Ne-Yo for bringing true R&amp;amp;B
  back to the industry! I dont consider songs about cheating on
  your bf/gf/husband/wife R&amp;amp;B. R&amp;amp;B is supposed to
  be about love - thats why people call them slow LOVE songs. And
  from 2001 - 2005 new slow love songs didn't exist. I ended up
  listenin to the same songs from da 90's over and over until I got
  so tired of them, and was fortunate to be lucky enough for my
  radio station (that plays mostly rap: a genre of music I dont
  like) to play "so sick" by Ne-Yo. It was a great song. This is
  literally the FIRST and only R&amp;amp;B album that I never have
  the urge to use the fast forward feature to get to the next song!
  Ne-Yo's lyrics are strictly romantic and sweet too! He is a
  lyrical genius. His voice is soothing and melodic. Most
  R&amp;amp;B albums obviously have rap tracks or rushed
  R&amp;amp;B songs as filler to probably meet the deadline or get
  the CD out as fast as possible and reducing the enjoyability of
  the CD, but THIS album has ALL songs that are great. All of the
  tracks on this album are great, but here are the ones that are
  SUPERB: 1. So sick - 9/10 (would be a 10 if it wasn't played over
  and over and with so many different versions. Although I can
  still listen to it over and over 2. When you're mad - 9/10 (for
  those guys who like the look on girls faces when they get mad.
  Maybe for Michelle Rodriguez fans. :) ) 3. Get Down Like that
  10/10 (both versions) (I call it "dont get down like that") (This
  song is for the guys that are completely faithful like me) (if
  you're not a player, and proud of being faithful, this is da song
  for you) 4. Sexy Love - 10/10 (great song. um hmmm.. what can i
  say about THIS one about its lyrics?.... oh yes.... this song is
  for the guys who have a girl and when she touches them, it just
  feels like.... Magic.) This is da only CD dat ever deserved 5
  stars by me, the only reason I gave OTHER R&amp;amp;B albums 5
  stars is cuz i took into consideration: there was no R&amp;amp;B
  album that existed that had NOTHING but good tracks, and most had
  poorly done upbeat song</Text>
  <Text category="music">I just loved this album the songs really
  related to my life. It was nice to see that there was personal
  experience involved while writing the songs</Text>
  <Text category="music">Can't say enough about how great this
  record is. It still stands the test of time by remaining
  relevant. "Summerland," and "Mission Man" are my personal favs,
  but the whole album deserves raves</Text>
  <Text category="music">This album was so good to hear when it
  came out. I like every song on here but my favorites are "Still
  Dre","The Watcher","Xxplosive","What's The Difference" and
  "Forget About Dre. Those are my favorites but there a lot of
  other songs that people will like. Recommend this album highly to
  rap fans. Buy this album you have nothing to loose because its
  Dre one of the best producers in the game right now so click on
  add to cart and be happy you hearing this classic</Text>
  <Text category="music">Not speaking or understanding Tibetian,
  didn't lessen the joy of being totally absorbed by this wonderful

  guides you like a sherpa, gently leading you along the high

  i invested thousands of dollars in a killer Dvd-audio/Super-audio

  between the dedicated Dvd-audio disc sold between $14.99-$29.99
  and the so call Bonus Dvd Disc...you will understand why iam so
  irritated at this new phenomenon.Today most good recievers can

  <Text category="music">I will state first off that I'm one of
  those hipster snobs who dismiss Pearl Jam's debut album, "Ten,"
  as the whining chart-whoring pseudo-anthemizing
  overpriced-flannel-flying watered-down-grungifying
  crowd-surfer-pandering piffle that it is. If you think that makes
  me inherently biased (unbalanced?) this review probably won't be
  "helpful" to you, and you can move on the other 250 or so
  reviews. If you decide to hear me out, I promise to be fair,
  'cause even though I may be a hipster snob, I can't deny to
  myself the sweet rockin' going on in "Vitalogy." This album
  represents one the best meeting points between what was then
  called "underground" or indie rock and the "classic" rock
  mainstream. Thus the production quality is raw when it needs to
  be but polished enough so it doesn't sound sloppy. Ballads like
  "Better Man" and its companion piece "Nothingman" are clearly
  influenced by Neil Young and even "Nebraska"-era
  Springsteen--they're sincere &amp;amp; emotional but not mushy
  &amp;amp; sentimental. "Not For You," with it's lyrics about how
  Eddie Vedder's small table has been invaded by uninvited hordes,
  is a none-too-subtle complaint about Pearl Jam's status as
  "millions served" rock gods and a longing for the more
  stripped-down aesthetic of punk. That, of course, is more
  directly the point of "Spin The Black Circle," an old-fashioned
  punk barnstormer that sounds like a close cousin to SST-era
  Husker Du. For Vedder, the joys of vinyl are that they seem
  "warmer"--a symbol of "tradional values" in a rock 'n' roll
  sense: independence, hard work and homespun crafts are better
  than the shiny, sterile corporate plastic of compact discs. Never
  mind the fact that vinyl was just as much a product of corporate
  culture; Vedder just feels a pleasing wave of childhood nostalgia
  cradling a 12" record sleeve in his arms and watching a needle
  bury itself into those mysterious black grooves. Pearl Jam may be
  in many ways traditionalists who long for the simple joys of just
  playing for the kids without corporate interference. On the other
  hand, the Big Corporate Evil has enabled them to reach a huge
  audience, which in turn helped them finance the elaborate
  packaging of "Vitalogy"--it's designed as a salute/satire of a
  very old hardcover book advising youths on good
  physical/mental/spiritual hygeine. The album, therefore, aims to
  strike a balance between the fondly-remembered rock stars of the
  band's own youth (the Who, Neil Young) and the more recent
  indie-punks that re-sparked their interest in the Power of Rock
  (Fugazi, Sonic Youth)--hence the title. The album is perhaps
  unnecessarily padded out with unfinished or noveltly tracks like
  "Bugs" and "Hey Foxymophandlemama That's Me," even though they're
  intended to give the album a looser and more light-hearted feel.
  Still, some of the songs that work the best are gloomy ones like
  "Last Exit" and the somewhat proggy sea chanty "Tremor Christ"
  (whose title I dearly hope is meant more as metaphor than an
  endorsement). Even though it's uneven, "Vitalogy" is the work of
  a self-reliant, even ornery band that's in full control of their
  ideas--even the bad ones. It's also not their fault that they
  influenced the likes of true bottom-feeding whores like Stone
  Temple Pilots and Matchbox 20.</Text>
  <Text category="music">I love this Pretenders album and Chrissie
  always rocks but I love the songwriting skill of Billy Steinberg
  &amp;amp; Tom Kelley. They wrote "Love Colours", "Night in my
  Veins" and the hit "Stand by You". Her follow-up to this, "VIVA!
  EL AMOR!" also contains three tracks written by them. I purchased
  this long after its release and was glad I did. Steinberg Kelley
  write memorable hooks and good lyrics with interesting chord
  changes. Something not all big names can do on their own and
  Chrissie wisely is aware of this.</Text>
  <Text category="music">This cd has so much going on and going for
  it - it's one of the number one releases this year for jazz fans.
  Lee Ritenour is one of those guitarists who sculpted much of the
  west coast evolutions in jazz during the 80's and you can hear
  why people followed his flavor on these tracks. He's never
  sounded better and the musicians who contributed with him on this
  cd are tight and magnificent in their own right. "Blue in Green"
  is one of my favorite jazz compositions by Miles Davis and Ernie
  Watts on tenor sax more than does it justice. "Ocean Ave." is as
  breezy and beachy as I think it's meant to be. My favorite tracks
  are easily "She Walks this Earth" (Ivan Lins' vocals are bossa
  nova beautiful), "Blue in Green" and predictably for me "Papa was
  a Rolling Stone" with powerful, crystal clear, unique trumpet by
  Chris Botti and soulful, rhythmic vocals by Kenya Hathaway and
  Grady Harrell. I went looking for that track because I am
  transfixed by Chris Botti's trumpet and what I found was a
  remarkable cd in its entirety. Happy me. ;</Text>

  <Text category="music">Feinstein is in love with the Gershwins
  and that passion is never made clearer than in Pure Gershwin.
  Michael's love affair with Ira's lyrics, his reckless abandon to
  the light-hearted spirit of the familiar -- and lesser known
  --phrases, more than makes up for the less polished vocal
  production in this early album. In fact, it is that very element
  that sells these songs as I've never heard them elsewhere.
  Michael pulls out all stops, embracing the less-than-lily-white
  additional verses of &amp;amp;quot;Embraceable You&amp;amp;quot;,
  with the unbridled passion of a first time lover. His duet with
  Rosie Clooney arrouses my curiosity about the movie in which this
  unknown number made its debut. What a delightful approach Michael
  demonstrates throughout.... Oh, to be that young and exuberant
  about life, love and music again</Text>
  <Text category="music">It would be easy to say that this is the
  single greatest performance of the Mahler Eighth ever recorded; I
  believe it is. But it would be difficult to say that and have it
  mean something, because after experiencing this colossal
  achievement, the competition (including, alphabetically, Abbado,
  Bernstein, Chailly, Haitink, Horenstein, Kubelik, Nagano, Olson
  [Colorado Mahlerfest], Solti, and Tennstedt, among others)
  suddenly seemed far less impressive than they once had. What sets
  this Mahler Eighth so far apart from virtually every other is its
  sense of ecstasy; of a transcendent vision being communicated, of
  a religious fervor. Mahler had an extraordinary plan in putting
  together what he considered his most important work, such that he
  could bring us to the brink and say, "There. It's out there. You
  can't see it, but you can divine it" (and call "it" what you
  will: "God" or "Love" or some all-embracing power outside of
  ourselves). Most performances miss the mark, then, in one of two
  ways: by remaining resolutely earthbound or by trying to capture
  that vision in terms we can understand. The problem, of course,
  is that if we can understand it, it's no longer a vision, it's
  something mundane. In the closing pages of Wit's extraordinary
  (and that word, as well as any other, hardly begins to do it
  justice) performance you become aware of that vision existing
  just beyond your comprehension. You know it's there only because
  you're willing to take that leap of faith. And that's what I mean
  when I say he brings the piece a sense of religious fervor. There
  is nothing dogmatic about the kind of religion I'm referring to
  here. So let's look at the basic components of the performance,
  element by element: The sound: Spectacularly natural and
  all-encompassing. The soloists emerge from the overall sonic
  image like members of the orchestra, and the chorus, orchestra,
  and organ blend to perfection. The soloists: To a letter the
  finest group I have ever heard. There's a distinctly Slavic sound
  that seems altogether appropriate given Mahler's Bohemian roots,
  and a refreshing lack of self-importance. No operatic
  grandstanding here. And for the first time ever I felt as though
  I was missing something by not following the words (no libretto
  is provided, though it is available online and can be found
  easily enough elsewhere) because everyone sounded like they cared
  dearly about what they were singing. They weren't going through
  the motions, making pretty sounds. They had something imperative
  to communicate and wanted us to know it. To be honest, part II
  has often bored me to tears (with Chailly's performance being
  particularly offensive in this regard) but here I was literally
  on the edge of my seat throughout, impatient to hear what (and
  who) came next. And throughout it all, so importantly, there was
  a sense of spiritual ascent from beginning to end. The choruses:
  Easily the best I've ever heard. The way they rip into "Hostem
  repellas longius" with their shrieks in the great double fugue of
  part I is unforgettable, and the fugue itself, which has never
  reminded me more of the "rabble" section from the first movement
  of Mahler's Third, literally had my spine tingling throughout its
  entire course. That's nothing. I got chills right at the
  beginning of the Chorus Mysticus and six and a half minutes later
  they had not abated! I have NEVER experienced anything like that
  before. Ever. And I don't just mean while listening to music. The
  conductor: What can I say? He holds the symphony together with a
  tautness and logic that nobody ever credited this work with
  having before. How? I have no idea, but when the start of part II
  doesn't jar, as it usually does, you know you're in for something
  special. Maybe it's because the orchestral prelude there seems
  faster than usual, or because he finds so much inwardness in the
  first part (the first entry of the soloists, for instance, is so
  raptly caressing). The orchestra: While they don't have the
  "Mahler sound" that the Concertgebouw or Vienna Philharmonic may
  produce, there's an earthiness (but never sloppiness) that sets
  them far apart from the bleached, sterile sound of too many
  American orchestras that make Mahler sound not like Mahler. To
  sum up, then, I could not speak for an hour after hearing this
  recording, and still burst into tears at the mere thought of it,
  especially those radiant, visionary, and extraordinary closing
  pages. Record of the year; record of the century! It crowns not
  merely my Mahler collection but an entire lifetime of listening
  to great music.</Text>
  <Text category="music">If you would have told me last year that I
  would own an album of piano solos I probably would have laughed
  in your face. While I enjoy several kinds of music, most of my
  favorites are in the classic rock and alternative genres. The
  reason I bought this is my wife and I are having a baby in
  December and our birthing class instructor played and reccomended
  Brickman as a popular choice for relaxation music and her
  personal favorite. I bought &amp;amp;quot;No Words&amp;amp;quot;
  and &amp;amp;quot;Simple Things&amp;amp;quot; mainly for their
  absence of singing and something to play while she is in labor. I
  have been listening to them nearly every night since we received
  them while browsing the internet or doing chores around the
  house. It really is amazing music that is very calming and
  relaxing. He definitely pours everything he has into his piano
  and the accompanying instruments and background is fabulous.
  Everything everyone else has stated in their reviews is right on
  as well. I would definitely reccomend not only this CD but Jim
  Brickman in general if you are looking for a nice relaxing
  getaway</Text>
  <Text category="music">this is without doubt the most beautiful,
  moving song i have ever heard. i cry every time i listen to it. i

  are a very good band that should be getting more cred than what
  they are getting. some of my faves on this cd include

  <Text category="music">This was the second tribe album i bought i
  was gonna get this cd before i got the low end theory but they
  didn't have it at the best buy i went to. I like this cd a lot
  but i like midnight mauraders more because phife got some more
  rap time and i like phife a little more than tip. Most people
  like tip more but i like phifes style a lot. All like all the
  songs but the most is luck of lucein, afterhours, foot prints, i
  left my wallet in el segundo, bonita applebum, can i kick it,
  rhythm, go ahead in the rain, and description of a fool. Man i
  pratically like all the tracks but the most remeberable. I wish
  they were still going to make another cd but its just tip coming
  out with another solo cd. The only complaint is that phife was
  only in a couple songs. This is one of my favorite rap albums
  with the jazz and r and b mix with the lyrics which makes this a
  absoulte must have for any hip hop fan is part of the tribe

  actually felt like I was there even my daughter thought it was
  really storming outside since I have a Subwoofer and was able to

  It does relax you and allows you to destress. There are other

  work for you. Johnny Lina</Text>
  <Text category="music">This album is absolutely fantastic! Paul
  and the band are incredibly tight and sound great together. Paul
  sounds very loose and like he's having a lot of fun - not as
  serious as some live shows I've heard. The songs focus mostly on
  his solo records, with some Jam and Style Council mixed in (all
  on disc two). Wisely, only five of the twenty three tracks are
  from "As Is Now" and they're the uptempo ones - it's not a hard
  sell by Yep Roc to make you buy that album if you don't already
  have it. The extended jams for "Porcelain Gods/Broken Stones,"
  "In The Crowd" and "Foot Of The Mountain" (one of my favorite
  solo tracks) all are focused and don't wander so they keep your
  attention. The crowd is energetic and into the show and are very
  appreciative when the Jam and Style Council classics get into the
  mix (although the sing-along to the album closing "Town Called
  Malice" is pretty lame). I haven't listened to the somewhat
  difficult to find "Live Wood" concert disc for a while to give a
  good comparison. However, since "Catch-Flame" covers all his solo
  discs instead of only "Paul Weller" and "Wild Wood," this is a
  more balanced collection. Highly recommended! personal

  <Text category="music">But a good debut album. This is when I
  felt proud knowin Ja was from ny. No radio friendly s*** here
  just street for the most part. But i guess when you were never
  really gangsta in the first place you can't keep talkin about it,
  which is why i guess he changed his style. Now the subject i
  wanna hit. Has anyone noticed that guy named progressive? Why
  does amazon allow goofs who hate hip hop trash our culture? And
  everytime I turn around its some damn rocker/junkie hippie. Last
  time i checked Rhythm and melody was part of music. I dont hear
  none of those when i through on heavy metal or rock. I'm tired of

  <Text category="music">This album is by far on the greatest
  recent live recordings. Sheryl Crow demonstrates her influence
  and talent by putting on an all star show with some of the
  biggest names in music history. Sheryl shines on her own, singing
  some of her great hits, but it's the duets that really make the
  album. My least favorite has to be the Dixie Chicks just because
  I can't appreciate the country flare they bring to "Strong
  Enough" but it's still a great version. Chrissie Hynde, one of
  the album's highlights, brings intense attitude to "If It Makes
  You Happy", still one of my favorite Sheryl songs. Stevie Nicks
  remains Stevie Nicks, giving more than enough emotion and flare
  to her own "Gold Dust Woman." Sarah McLachlan's usually soft
  voice comes out strong on "The Difficult Kind" and compliments
  Sheryl's quite nicely. My favorite rendition has to be Eric
  Clapton and Sheryl together on Cream's "White Room", the rock-out
  moment on the album. The show is complete when all the guests
  return to belt out Bob Dylan's "Tombstone Blues" and close the
  show with a definite BANG</Text>
  <Text category="music">I won't say to everybody this greatest
  hits is highly recommended. Being that I never heard all of her
  albums, so a true fan may feel like some songs is missin'.
  However for me, who is just really startin to seriously get into
  pop is somewhat satisfied with these and this is a 5 star
  collection to me. Some of the tracks I love, a couple I don't
  like at all and the rest I just like. My favorite ones are in
  order; Erotica Ray of Light Beautiful Stranger The power of
  goodbye Deeper and Deeper The prodution is excellent and I love
  the vocals. If your new to Madonna, my opinion would be to start
  here. But a true fan can give me lessons.</Text>
  <Text category="music">First of all Bob Dylan is certainly not
  for everyone. However, if his style is up your alley this is a
  classic. You can turn on the radio and hear all those classic
  songs of his like "lay lady lay" or "like a rolling stone" to
  name a couple. Planet Waves is the type of album where the sum of
  the songs come together wonderfully. This is probably my favorite
  Dylan album and I have all the "classics" like Blonde on Blonde,
  Blood on the Tracks, Highway 61 revisited. ect. I'd recommend
  this to any Dylan fan</Text>
  <Text category="music">So, Incubus rocks no matter who you are or
  which of their albums is your favorite. Plainly put, this album

  disappointed</Text>
  <Text category="music">Even though Gary Allen is a country
  singer, he rocks as an artist! He has a vein of rock mixed in

  could melt butter along with any woman's heart. Guys will like
  him too, but he's a crooner, his ballads touch women (sigh!) and
  make men want to emulate him. I enjoyed every song on this CD,
  but my personal favorites are: Tough little boys, and Songs about

  <Text category="music">It is good for old Eric Gale fans to be

  has played on. Pay close attention to She is my lady and morning
  glory. This is a must have cd. jaye price Beltsville, md.</Text>
  <Text category="music">I have seen Phantom on stage twice and
  regularly listen to this cast recording. It is a different
  approach to the classic Leroux novel; one that is gentler and

  this production if it plays nearby.</Text>
  <Text category="music">I read about Lila Downs' new CD, La
  Cantina, in Victor Cruz- Lugo's article entitled, "Sweet Sorrow,"
  published in the June-July 2006 issue of Hispanic Magazine (page
  76). It is an honor and a pleasure to offer these few reflections
  on Lila Downs' new CD, La Cantina: 1. The CD cover is awesome, a
  beautiful and colorful work of art illustrating Lila in a pensive
  and contemplative mid-air pause with her guitarra ready to rock.
  It strikes me as an example of the rising feminine in our time,
  awakening the historically-oppressed feminine from its slumber
  and into an alto canto of unstoppable and celebratory song. 2.
  Each track is a lively composition of Mexican corridos and sones
  impregnated with Lila's lovely voice that makes me feel so proud
  to be mexicano-chicano-hualahuisense and a member of our precious
  universal human family. 3. I first was introduced to Lila Downs
  and her musical talent when I enrolled in writer Juan Felipe
  Herrera's legendary Manikrudo Summer Arts class at Cal State
  Fresno in 2000. Juan Felipe invited her to our class room and she
  impressed us all with her down-to-earth talented voice. Later
  that night we all saw her in concert at the Tower Theatre in
  Fresno and I've been a fan of her work ever since. 4. This new CD
  is indeed a delightful experience. I appreciate that she moved
  into the corrido, son, etc. genres which makes me appreciate her
  music so much more. It has so much more appeal to me without
  bordering on the commercial and superficious. It's authentic and
  retains its articistic musical integrity. I think that this is a
  hallmark that we can expect from all of Lila's work. She is a
  true artist. I've always appreciated her darker and earthier
  songs in her first two CDs, however, this new stride into popular
  folk corridos is a movement into another aspect of the heart and
  soul of the mexicano experience. 5. I am very impressed with
  Lila's voice and how it has matured since the summer of 2000.
  There seems to be more color and flair in it and definitely mucho
  corazon. Ahua! Her solos in "Yo ya me voy," have my soul spinning
  to the outer edges of infinity. As Victor Cruz-Lugo writes,
  "Through it all, Downs' powerful alto voice cuts a path into the
  deepest pits of your heart, tears something out of there and
  somewhow we as listeners wind up asking her for more of the
  same." This is my favorite of Lila's repertoire. It is my opinion
  that those who purchase this CD will not be disappointed.
  Enjoy!</Text>
  <Text category="music">If you're a Strummer fan who is an
  historical completist then you'll want this disc. Also, there are
  some really good tunes on here for anyone, particularly Joe's
  "Keys to Your Heart". Some of the live material here is high
  quality and some is not. This is likely not a CD you will listen
  to over and over again as you would artists who are fresh. But,
  I'm just glad this finally appeared on disc as I've always wanted
  to hear it and as a Joe fanatic, I had to have it. There's
  moments here that sound like a rough draft of JS and the
  Mescaleros, but also moments of pure rock 'n roll circa mid 70's
  with some great guitar solos. If Joe had not been where UK punk
  started after this band there's no telling what he would have
  done but you can be sure he'd have kept playing in a band. I'm a
  huge Clash and Strummer fan, but I rate this 4 stars more for its
  historical significance than for the actual quality and
  uniqueness of the content</Text>
  <Text category="music">Wonderful cd the music brings back a lot
  of childhood memories! A must have for those who are looking for
  a cd that includes Neil Diamond's top hits.</Text>
  <Text category="music">I bought this out of a cut rack for $3.99.
  It sat in my CD tower for at least 5 years before I ever really
  listened to it.I couldn't stand the way it sounded over my stereo
  and I came close to trading it.I brought it to work and put my
  headphones on and it sounds like a completely different album.I
  really like the whole experience. I'm lucky I brought it up
  here-it was going nowhere at home but I'm playing it a couple of
  times a day over my headphones. I don't know anything about this
  band,I bought it on a whim,but I'd reccommend this album and I
  may follow up on this band</Text>
  <Text category="music">There is a reason why Styx was the first
  musical act to have 4 triple platinum albums in row! Find out
  why. They are a unique band, with their own uncatagorizable style
  and sound. Not hard rock, but can rock. Not pop, but catchy
  melodies and great three part harmony. Not art rock, but themed
  concepts in their writing and dramatic tempo changes and
  crescendos in their music. It is probably true that Lady was the
  first power ballad, though Styx was not credited for it. Lady
  paved the way for other rock bands to showcase their softer
  sides. Perhaps Styx was not always successful in their attempts,
  but they took chances artistically and musically and should be
  given props for doing so. Every song on this CD is great; however
  the two that stand out for me are Too Much Time On My Hands and
  Suite Madame Blue. Most people who have spent time in
  neighborhood bar will would likely agree that Too Much Time On My
  Hands is witty, funny, and true. Suite Madame Blue a song which
  is a metaphor for the United States is simply One of the Greatest
  Rock Songs Ever!! The lyrics of Suite Madame Blue are as powerful
  as the music, and this song contains all the elements which made
  Styx great</Text>
  <Text category="music">this is quite a sharp turn from francine's
  previous album (40 on a fall day)... whereas the last album was
  closer sonically to frontman clayton scoble's work in poundcake,
  this time around it's quieter, subtler, sweeter and sadder. make
  no mistake, this is a break-up album. even those songs that make
  no mention of breaking up leave you with that cold, lonely,
  hug-craving feeling only the best break-up albums can. the mood
  will draw you in and keep you listening, but after a few listens
  it's the songs you'll fall in love with. ahh, the songs. they're
  densely packed with chord changes, odd but appealing lyrics, and
  unexpected instrumentation. they're hooky without being obvious
  (a francine specialty). this was my favourite album of 2003, and
  i still listen to it pretty often these days. best tracks: this

  <Text category="music">I'm biased, because I loved the movie and
  adore the book. Gregson-Williams does an outstanding job here
  (before this, I was most familiar with his score work on Metal
  Gear Solid videogames). The music is extremely touching and
  magical. The "Evacuating London Score" (from the scene in the
  train station) tugs at the heartstrings. And the "Battle Score"
  brings back the images of the dynamic battle at the movie's
  climax. One song that's missing is the 1940s jazz song played in
  the movie when the kids are playing hide and seek. Other than
  that absence (probably due to copyright restrictions), this is an
  excellent CD. As for the "Bonus" DVD - I probably wouldn't
  purchase it if I had a second chance. It's got some nice gallery
  art of movie stills and concept art. There is only one trailer,
  and it is not the very first one released, which opens with the
  kids at the mansion and really gets the blood pumpin' with its
  intro of the wardrobe. There are also behind-the-scenes
  interviews I haven't watched yet, but I wonder if they'll appear
  again when the movie DVD is released.</Text>

  <Text category="music">I saw Midlake at festival recently and had
  never heard of them. The live set was strong enough to convince
  me to order some albums and I'm now a solid fan. The opening
  track, Roscoe, reminds me a bit of Adrian Belew, a bit of XTC and
  a whole lot of Midlake themselves. It's like suddenly realizing
  how Coldplay should sound. The music is layered and atmospheric
  with a bit of an eels feel. Midlake is definitely their own band,
  for all the influences I'm throwing out. They make the sort of
  music that feels old, like your favorite album you lost long ago.
  Try 'Roscoe' or 'Young Bride' for an indication of their style.
  If you like either of those, you need to buy the album.</Text>
  <Text category="music">Everyone has their favorite Beatle. Some
  people love to complain about Paul's solo music, comparing it to
  John's. The fact is that each of the Beatles had their own style,
  and together they had a magical symbiosis. Separately they each
  pursued a solo career that simply solidified what we already
  knew. So Paul's music is light hearted? Maybe even silly? Sure,
  but if you are like me and enjoy each Beatle for what they
  brought to the group, then this is a wonderful album. No you
  won't find deep soul searching here, just fun! And fun is what
  this album has in abundance. So if you want to curse Paul for his
  naivet&amp;#x1A;, don't buy this album. If you loved the Beatles,
  and enjoyed each one for their individual talent, this is a fun
  solo album. In my humble opinion it is Paul's best solo album, as
  he really spreads his "Wings" and you can hear the sense of
  freedom coming through loud and clear. Later albums seem to
  become too engineered, and never seem to have the same energy
  that this album has.</Text>
  <Text category="music">At first I didn't think there was enough

  comment on how fantastic this compilation is. I have a
  four-year-old and an eighteen-month-old, and this CD is in heavy
  rotation at our house. My husband and I love the music at least
  as much as they do -- it's stylish and sets a great mood as we're
  making dinner and doing dishes. The kids love it too, needless to
  say. My four-year-old's favorites are Three Blind Mice (she loves
  when the farmer's wife squeaks that she'll give back the tails)
  and the final track by Peggy Lee (where she says the word *poop*,
  as in "party poop" -- endless laughter ensues). Ella Fitzgerald's
  A-Tisket, A-Tasket and Chew, Chew Your Bubblegum are priceless.
  All in all, I highly recommend this CD -- everyone will be happy
  to hear it again and again</Text>

  best, most consistent music I've heard in YEARS. I started with
  Summer in Abaddon and was weak in the knees, then I acquired
  their debut album and could barely stand...and now, Blue Screen
  Life has about knocked the breath right out of me. I haven't
  gotten through the entire back catalog because I can't stop
  listening to the three albums I have in my hands. Words cannot
  express how fascinating this band is - intricate &amp;amp;
  complicated with a simple, straightforward delivery. Their
  transitions are SICK. They put their contemporaries (death cab,
  the shins, the killers) to SHAME. I love all of the
  aforementioned bands, but Pinback slaughters them in delivering
  well conceived, perfectly executed, diversified albums that you
  can listen to from front to back, over &amp;amp; over. How many
  albums can you say that about? They are heavenly. The standouts
  are XIY, Boo, Concrete Seconds, Bbtone, Prog, Pene... oh, screw
  it - every song is GREAT!</Text>
  <Text category="music">Sam Moore's new CD is a welcome return to
  the roots of soul. This CD has got IT! Sam's voice is superb and
  the duets he does with his guests are wonderful. I'm not a fan of
  country music so I was a bit fearful of what Wynona and Travis
  Tritt would do with Sam. Wow! Are they ever good! Wynona's got
  it. I'm going to listen to more of her now. The musicians are the
  best! I thought I could hear that wonderful touch of Earth Wind
  and Fire on some of the numbers so I went searching the notes.
  Sure enough--there is Reggie Young--the wonderful Earth Wind and
  Fire trombonist! Go Reggie! Billy Preston is wonderful on "You
  are So Beautiful" as is the accompanying guitar by Eric Clapton.
  This is a musician's CD--quality all the way. I have had the
  great pleasure of seeing Sam Moore and Billy Preston in person
  (with Bowzer's Doo Wop Party--thank god for Bowzer, bringing back
  all these wonderful artists) and they were wonderful. I'd love to
  see even more of Sam Moore. Thanks to Randy Jackson for putting
  this together. This is a class-act.</Text>
  <Text category="music">When I bought this I played it on repeat
  for about 45 hours. Different versions than on the album (I think
  it's their demo). This version of Modern Age is amazing.
  Definitely worth buying</Text>
  <Text category="music">I have a few hundred surf CDs and I would
  have to say thet this CD is my favorite! My next favorite is
  their new CD called "Headin' Out". They have the reverb and the
  composition that just makes all of the songs fantastic. If you
  like instrumental surf you will love this CD! Buy it you won't be
  sorry</Text>
  <Text category="music">As a fan of both celtic traditional and
  bluegrass music I was wary of a CD claiming to be a hybrid - too
  often it means an unsatisfactory compromise where original
  flavours become watered down and insipid. I need not have worried
  - Tim O'Brien has produced one of the most amazing and rewarding
  musical journeys I've followed for some time. Not only do the
  players from the two traditions blend instinctively and
  harmoniously but the tracks , mostly songs, are marvellous
  vehicles for new and exciting directions. There are superb
  performances all round, vocally from O'Brien with guests Paul
  Brady, Maura O'Connell, Kathhy Mattea, Del McCoury etc and
  musicians Altan, Frankie Gavin, Jerry Douglas, Earl Scruggs,
  Seamus Egan and a host of others and the sound is fresh, acoustic
  and vital, requiring no production gimmicks or effects. Standout
  songs for me personally are &amp;amp;quot;Mountaineer is Always
  Free&amp;amp;quot;, &amp;amp;quot;Lost Little
  Children&amp;amp;quot;, &amp;amp;quot;Wandering&amp;amp;quot; and
  &amp;amp;quot;John Riley&amp;amp;quot; although there is not a
  weak track on the CD. It is obvious that for Tim O'Brien this has
  been a labour of love. If you like acoustic music, from any
  tradition, either side of the Atlantic, you'll love it. Several
  of my friends have bought it on my recommendation and agree it is
  brilliant</Text>
  <Text category="music">NWA was an original rap group and with
  that being said, this is definitely a must have album for rap
  lovers. Along with Public Enemy, NWA christened their genre with
  hard core lyrics and tight bass beats. Although I don't agree
  with some of their lyrics, one would not expect this white kid to
  fully understand their view on life. Anyways, buy this album, I
  recommend it. Keep it away from the kiddies though</Text>
  <Text category="music">Of course, no jazz musician can pack the
  energetic wallop that Dizzy could. His trumpet can only be
  described as HOT, and hearing his music makes you think of people
  dancing their legs off with garbage cans burning all around and
  smoke in the air. This man's music has LIFE in it. Unfortunately,
  the REAL energy to Dizzy is in his Latin Jazz work, and a more
  complete compilation of that style would be the Compact Jazz
  series. Ken Burns' collection here is more versatile, but just
  not as lively as Dizzy's music can be. Proceed with
  caution</Text>
  <Text category="music">While not dissimilar to other excellent
  acts such as Coldplay, Keane, and Pete Yorn, Travis have
  distinguished themselves as a band with their own unique style
  and sound. This, their 2nd album, is the best of their music:
  melodic throughout, with catchy tunes, solid lyrics, and
  tremendous guitar work that captures the listener from the first
  chords of 'Sing' to the fade-out from 'The Humpty Dumpty Love
  Song'. If you buy an album once you know three or four or more of
  its songs are excellent, then I confidently recommend The
  Invisible Band to you. Rating each song individually for one's
  ipod: 1. Sing, Side, The Cage, Afterglow and the Humpty Dumpty
  Love Song are each worthy of four to five stars 2. Pipe Dreams,
  Flowers in the Window, Safe, Follow the Light, and Indefinitely
  are three to four star songs 3. The balance are two to three
  stars each. The only poor effort is probably "Last Train", which
  is too plodding relative to its counterparts The Invisible Band
  is basically a healthy mix of folksy, hopeful songs mixed with
  just the right amount of melancholy. Nowhere is this better
  reflected than in 'The Humpty Dumpty Love Song', which defines
  this mix perfectly. While this is the best of the album, the rest
  is well worth listening to repeatedly. Highly recommended</Text>
  <Text category="music">I really think it's Simon's best. This,
  and perhaps (in a very different style) "Paul Simon." I'm just
  listening to it again after several years...the melodies are
  intricate, the words are vivid and allusive, the range is
  astounding. Graceland has a wonderful rock-style going on, but I
  really think this is my favorite. I know a lot of non-Simon fans
  who love this one album. It's just fantastic</Text>
  <Text category="music">Blue Note was on the mark to re-release
  this classic. Tina Brook's style of blues laced jazz is a sound
  that will bring joy to your soul. A must have CD for any jazz
  collection</Text>
  <Text category="music">This CD is absolutely wonderful. I am in
  Australia so Strawberry Shortcake merchandise is not as readily
  available down here as it is in the USA, so you can imagine my
  daughters delight when this CD is being played. The songs are
  just gorgeous - I just wish they were a little longer. I
  thoroughly recommend this item to any little SS Fans.</Text>
  <Text category="music">Comparing Gogol Bordello and JUF is like
  comparing apples and oranges. I have seen Gogol live more times
  than I have fingers and toes to count on. When I bought JUF I did
  not expect to hear anything remotely resembling a Gogol album.
  This is a dancehall album. You like it or you don't, but just
  remember it is a side project. It does not make any sense to
  compare it to other Gogol albums. Listen before you buy</Text>
  <Text category="music">This CD brings back memories of the early
  60's when Vince Martin and Fred Neil played at The Flick , The
  Coffee House, and the Hootenanny here in Miami. I've had the LP
  forever. Now that I'm getting the CD, I can listen in my car and
  remember seeing them perform live</Text>
  <Text category="music">This is a fantastic holiday Christmas
  album. Doris Day's beautiful voice singing these terrific
  Christmas songs make for a beautiful sound that will bring all
  who listen years of enjoyment. A must have for those who enjoy
  hearing terrific Christmas music over the holidays</Text>
  <Text category="music">THIS ALBUM IZ OFF DA FREAKIN CHAIN!!!!!
  GREAT MUSIC AND GRACE SLICK IZ THE BEST!!!!!!! THIS IS A MUST
  HAVE!!!!!!!!</Text>
  <Text category="music">Sidney Bechet was one of the first real
  fathers of jazz. Burns puts together a great combination of early
  recordings. Jazz historions note Bechet as one of the only horn
  players that could keep up with Louis Armstrong. You have to
  include Bechet in your Jazz collection, and this one is as good
  as any</Text>
  <Text category="music">Great compilation of songs from Massive
  Attack, all of their singles plus new never release songs. The
  videos are great and their new single 'live with me' is a great
  song (very sad video though). Includes new version/remix of 'I
  want you' with madonna. The combo is great you can own ALL of the
  videos, is a lot of fun to see the videos from blue lines until
  100th window from the 90s all the way to the new single, the
  changes in the way they used to make music videos. There's even
  the first video with Tricky). A must have for any massive attach
  fan, and if you never heard from this band, you get the best of
  the best with this cds/dvd. Massive Attack is a band that had
  influenced a lot of artist from Bjork, Tricky, Madonna,
  Morcheeba, Portishead, UNKLE, etc.</Text>
  <Text category="music">I love this album. Mc Lyte is one of the
  best female rappers.How can someone not like her rap</Text>
  <Text category="music">I supposed I should not have been watching
  this movie when I was nine years old, but I remember seeing it
  several times via HBO. More importantly, my father bought the
  soundtrack and we used to listen to it over &amp;amp; over in the
  car. The songs stuck with me for years, and every know and then
  I'll hear something out of context and I'll be taken back to
  roadtrips with my family. It's something that I won't think about
  for ages, but when I'm reminded of it, I can't believe I don't
  still have a copy of the soundtrack. I remember it had quiet and
  comforting songs mixed in with songs you could sing along too.
  It's perfect for driving and just having on in the
  background</Text>
  <Text category="music">This soundtrack cd is the perfect
  compliment to the visionary film--Cater Burwells score is a
  pitch-perfect aural equivocation of the profound sadness and
  blithe absurdity on display,with his sense of minimalist
  suggestiveness and rich textural instincts shining bightly.Also
  an added bonus of the above-mentioned dream combination--Bartok's
  &amp;amp;quot;Allegro&amp;amp;quot;(I know diddly about classical
  music,but Bartok rocks!!),and a typically great Bjork
  song&amp;amp;quot;Amphibian&amp;amp;quot;(in two versions),that
  book-ends the album with an etherial,dream-like haze</Text>
  <Text category="music">I would have to say that out of the
  countless bands i have heard over the past few years Into
  Eternity is one of the best and has one solid album here!! I
  think they have something a lot of bands do not have and the one
  cool thing about them is Tim Roth seems to give a real crud about
  his fans as he does guitar videos on his website to show you how
  you can break down his guitar riffs and that to me as a guitarist
  is so helpful (ive learned some of their songs this way) and this
  shows how he is not afraid to be the nicest guy and actually take
  that kind of time to be close and original to his fans.you just
  never see that these days. And the rest of this band has so much
  talent, Stu can scream like halford growl too and has a high
  vocal range and it makes them sound interesting. Plus jims drum
  work, how can anyone say this dude isnt one of the better
  drummers, he is so tight but can slow it down and tempo change
  very well. This album plain rocks, It should be known as these
  guys were on Gigantour and rocked there too. Be cool if them and
  annihilator went on tour. I have become very fond of them and
  hope they stick around and keep making great albums in a world
  overflowing with the same ole un-original bands that all sound
  the same!</Text>
  <Text category="music">The progressive metal world better wake up
  and take note of this outstanding band that hails from Poland.
  These guys are a breath of fresh air with the oversaturated and
  stagnant progressive metal market that has developed over the
  past few years. So what do we get for our money you ask, a band
  comprising of well-schooled musicians, incredible song writing
  skills and the ability to weave so many different moods and
  time-passages into each song. There are a few scatterings of
  influences that aren't a major detraction from the overall mood
  of the album, namely Dream Theater, Pink Floyd, Porcupine Tree,
  Genesis and Anathema. The vocals are clean without a trace of an
  accent,however they get getting slightly gruff in places but this
  only compliments the smooth flow of the music. The guitar work is
  outstanding and David Gilmour from Pink Floyd is a strong
  reference point here. The rhythm section is outstanding;
  especially the drumming and the keyboards give the album a fuller
  sound with out being too over powering. If you want to start 2007
  on a good note then Riverside is a worthy investment for
  sure.</Text>
  <Text category="music">Back when Blondie was being hailed as the
  biggest new-wave band in pop music by fans and critics alike,
  there were also just as many critics that quickly dismissed
  Blondie as "bubblegum pop," and one group that would never have
  staying power. But I think it's been observed enough how the
  group has had the last laugh. Parallel Lines helped establish
  Blondie as a serious music group and turned their cult following
  into commercial success. This album is also the first where
  Debbie Harry's voice gets sharpened with the sensibility of a
  sweet, vulnerable girl one minute to sultry and rapturous behind
  disco grooves the next. The album made punk, pop, and disco shake
  hands, which was a method unheard of in 1978. Songs like "Hanging
  on the Telephone," "Picture This," "Pretty Baby," and "Sunday
  Girl," have become irresitable pop gems, while "I Know But I
  Don't Know," and "Fade Away &amp;amp; Radiate," featuring a
  terrific guitar lick by Robert Fripp, are punk-driven classics.
  Last but not least are the two hits that are forever getting
  played on the classic rock stations of today in "One Way or
  Another," and "Heart of Glass." And how has Debbie Harry played
  out as lead singer after all these years? As Rolling Stone stated
  when this album was ranked #140 on their list of the 500 greatest
  albums of all time, "Madonna was surely watching."</Text>
  <Text category="music">I loved this album. Strangely enough I was
  introduced to the title song by Gray's Anatomy where I just had
  to find out who was singing that lead (Alice Russell). The rest
  of the album is like the R&amp;amp; B music I grew up with.
  Definitely worth a listen</Text>
  <Text category="music">I've always written how the American NOW
  compilations do not even come close to the British ones, and my
  opinion has not since changed. NOW 20's track list, however, is
  solid and pretty good for the American series. It has mostly good
  rap songs (which can be sometimes rare in this series), great
  rock songs, and not an overload of mediocrities. I'll go in
  depth. 1. Missy Elliott Feat. Ciara &amp;amp; Fatman Scoop - Lose
  Control...A A great rap song - Missy Elliott has a great style
  and her lyrics are actually understandable and enjoyable. Ciara
  is a nice addition to the song. Fatman Scoop's random screaming
  in the background wasn't essential, but it at least adds some
  energy to the track. The music's actually interesting and
  something different from everything else. 2. Black Eyed Peas -
  Don't Phunk With My Heart...C+ Their first album was stellar, and
  their second is as well. But this was one of the worst tracks on
  "Monkey Business" and did not deserve to become a single.
  Annoying, but not horrible. 3. Pussycat Dolls Feat. Busta Rhymes
  - Don't Cha...A- A really good rap song - Busta's rapping is a
  good addition to the song, making this radio remix better than
  the original on the Pussycat Dolls' album, "PCD". A dangerously
  catchy chorus elevates this song to a pretty high grade. 4.
  Rihanna - Pon de Replay...B+ Pretty catchy, and a good party
  song. But it gets pretty irritating after a while. And the "dip
  it low and you pick it up slow" from the first verse directly
  copies from Christina Milian's "Dip it Low". That's so
  unoriginal, Rihanna! 5. Ludacris Feat. Bobby Valentino - Pimpin'
  All Over the World...B Good music, but it's not much without the
  video, which was, by the way, partly shot in Africa. 6. Bow Wow
  Feat. Ciara - Like You...B Bow Wow's returning to the rap scene
  was really unneeded, but Ciara's chorus makes this song better
  than mediocre. 7. Dem Franchize Boys Feat. Jermaine Dupri, Da
  Brat &amp;amp; Bow Wow - I Think They Like Me (Remix)...C This
  song does not deserve the publicity, and I'm stunned why people
  like this. It's worse than mediocre, it's horribly irritating.
  And much of the song is bleeped out because the original is so
  dirty. Rap just isn't rap when it's edited, and this song is
  proof. But even without the editing I don't think this song has a
  chance. Annoying "yep"s in the background and mediocre
  rapping...just skip it already. 8. Destiny's Child - Cater
  2u...B- Mediocre for Destiny's Child. Actually pretty boring. But
  they have great voices. 9. Lyfe Jennings - Must Be Nice...C+
  Mediocre. 10. Natasha Bedingfield - These Words...A A great "new"
  artist who actually found success with this song a year earlier
  the US. Great songwriting about bad songwriting (if that makes
  any sense at all) and a good voice. Now I'm just wondering when
  her brother Daniel's going to release another "If You're Not the
  One". 11. Kelly Clarkson - Behind These Hazel Eyes...A- The only
  American Idol who earned over twenty minutes of success, Kelly's
  finding massive success with her second album, and for a reason -
  she's got an awesome voice, and pulls off rock quite well. This
  song was brutally murdered by the radio, but that's why I've
  moved onto the remixes (not on this album). 12. D.H.T. - Listen
  to Your Heart (Unplugged Version)...A Though Furios F.EZ's hard
  trance remix of this song is a lot better than this unplugged
  piano version, this amazing cover of the Roxette track deserved
  all the fame it got. Edmee's got a fantastic voice and this is a
  perfect song for her. Beautiful song also. 13. Backstreet Boys -
  Just Want You To Know...A- The Backstreet Boys' newest album must
  have been the #1 most unwanted comeback of all time (let's just
  hope N*Sync doesn't follow...*cringe* Justin Timberlake), but
  this is their best song. And this comes from someone hard to
  impress by the Backstreet Boys, but they pull off this rock song
  pretty well. 14. Click 5 - Just the Girl...A A really good rock
  song which many can relate to. 15. Franz Ferdinand - Do You Want
  To...B Atonal, but Franz Ferdinand has a good reputation, so I'll
  let it slide. But this is definitely evidence of a sophomore
  slump. 16. Weezer - Beverly Hills...A+ Unfortunately it was
  flattened, torn apart, and buried alive by the radios, so I will
  review it as it was still last summer when I first heard it. This
  song is amazing and the chorus is way too catchy to believe. But
  I don't need to write this, as most people already know. 17. Fall
  Out Boy - Sugar We're Going Down...A An amazing song, but it's
  only good if you can put up with songs where you can't understand
  what they're saying. Seriously, it took approximately six times
  looking up the lyrics to actually realize what's being said here.
  But the music is great, and this song overall is a pretty good
  rock track. 18. Lifehouse - You &amp;amp; Me...A- An instant
  classic. 19. Coldplay - Fix You...A+ I've read mixed reviews
  about this song, but personally, I think its amazing. Following a
  vaguely similar buildup as Led Zeppelin's "Stairway to Heaven",
  this song just keeps you listening until the end. The rockout
  part at the end is magical. 20. Keith Urban - You'll Think of
  Me...B It's somewhat annoying that Keith's been on NOW albums
  consistently for a while but his songs aren't as popular as, say,
  Gretchen Wilson. I'm starting to think Keith's been put on these
  albums not for popular songs but just so a default country artist
  could be there. A good song, but it could've been replaced with
  something better in the Country department. So overall, this is a
  great selection of songs, some amazing, some decent, and some
  mediocre to bad. I'd suggest you buy this, as it's a good list of
  tracks. Overall, this album gets a B+.</Text>
  <Text category="music">There are plenty of reasons to get this
  Dead Album. One is the fact that this is probably the best
  recorded Psychedelic CD of all time. It was the first Rock album
  recorded on a 16 track. In fact it was rerecorded to take
  advantage of the technology. The remaster is splendid. Another
  good reason is the great bonus tracks. Almost 80 minutes of dead
  for less than the price of driving your SUV to the record store.
  Can you dig it</Text>
  <Text category="music">This remasted disc is nice with the bonus
  tracks and spiffed up sound, but the only way top hear Aoxomoxoa
  is to find a original W7 (Warner Brothers-Seven Arts) green label
  vinyl pressing. The CD features the 1971 remix (like the 1989 CD)
  in which 1/3 of the backing has been stripped like Constanten's
  prepared backrounds on "What's Become Of The Baby", the extra
  drums and barbershop vocal on "Doin That Rag". St Stephen lost
  something in the remix as well. Anthem was remixed as well in
  1972 but the band was wise to issue the 1968 mix on CD. No hidden
  goodies on this disc, but the bonus tracks are great</Text>
  <Text category="music">This album is simply one of the coolest
  things around, and when I listened to it, it inspired me to a
  similar project using the same 'weaving and zoning from place to
  place' kind of method. What this basically is, are field
  recordings of various different indigenous and mainstream musics
  from mostly Indian/Middle Eastern/Oriental festivals; they are
  then mixed together nicely into one flowing peice. You get Indian
  gamelan, mussette accordion, vocal choruses, foreign tongue
  talking, and psychadelic bagpipes all in one 33 minute track, and
  then some. It's very trippy, and it hints at some kind of endless
  dream where we flow from place to place without reason. Get this
  for your own good</Text>
  <Text category="music">Back in the 70's and 80's, I listened to a
  really great radio station, WSGS in Hazard, Kentucky. From my
  home in Flat Gap, Virginia, and anywhere in the region, it was
  well known that if you wanted real country music, you simply had
  to turn on WSGS. 100,000 watts of pure, monophonic country music.
  I'm not talking about the big hats of Nashville, or the gussied
  up ladies who pose as country singers these days. No, it was the
  real thing, including local and regional bluegrass, gospel,
  hiccup preachers, Loretta Lynn, Lefty Frizzel, Merle Haggard,
  Bill Monroe, Grandpa Jones, and countless others. When I listen
  to this Pattly Loveless release, I think she must have been
  listening too. It sounds just like the typical afternoon group of
  selections on old WSGS. Only better, because Patty is from our
  time, and seems to have that old time, mountain shout-it-out
  style much like many of those who came before. She reminds me a
  bit of Wilma Lee Cooper. What a voice! If you have never heard of
  these early country artists, and you like the way Patty does it
  up here, it would be good to go back and see where she learned
  all this great music from. This is the real thing</Text>
  <Text category="music">Saw this fella in 'You see me laughin' on
  IFC. Good straight ahead delta style blues. This is the real

  <Text category="music">With all the recent praise heaped on
  Smile, Orange Crate Art still remains largely under-recognized
  and under-appreciated. Sure, Smile was supposed to be this grand
  Copelandesque landscape of America, from Plymouth Rock to The
  Grand Cooley Dam. But for my money Brian and Van Dyke Parks did
  it so much better with Orange Crate Art. Having written, what
  everyone unanimously agrees to be the most California of all
  anthems, Fun Fun Fun, I Get Around and California Girls, Brian
  turns his attention to a California not of Hot Rods and Surf, but
  of sun drenched valleys rich with citrus and vine. Here Wilson
  and Parks celebrate and pay homage to the likes of Jack London
  and John Steinbeck. And if all this were not enough, we're
  treated to My Hobo Heart, a latter day Van Dyke Parks / Michael
  Hazelwood masterpiece. There's also the lovely Palm Tree
  &amp;amp; Moon, a dreamy little ode to a moonlit beach, territory
  not unfamiliar to Brian. And Summer In Monteray is so unabashedly
  nostalgic it would even make Clint Eastwood Blush. If you haven't
  become familiar with this so very underated collection yet, you
  really can't call yourself a Brian Wilson / Van Dyke Parks fan
  until you give this one a fair shot. You might even find yourself
  humming Sail Away or Hold Back Time while in the shower. I know I
  did</Text>
  <Text category="music">I bought this CD six months ago because I
  am a Miami Vice fan. I didn't expect it to be good, but it is
  wonderful. &amp;amp;quot;In Dulce Decorum&amp;amp;quot; is
  incredible! This is a hard-to-find CD. You will love it! I enjoy
  it more with each playing</Text>
  <Text category="music">For anyone who loves trumpet music as I
  do, this album is a must. Wynton Marsalis has mastered twenty
  all-time favorite pieces with such brilliance, that no other
  trumpeteer comes near by comparison. Opening with J. Clarke's,
  The King's March, Wynton proceeds to favor listeners with such
  baroque favorites as Purcell's Entrada from "The Indian Queen,"
  J. Clark's The Prince of Denmark's March and J. Stanley's Trumpet
  Voluntary. Fantastic selections from Bach, Mozart, and Haydn
  follow, with the album also including such delightful listening
  as The Last Rose of Summer, Carnival of Venisee, and Flight of
  the Bumblebee. You won't be disappointed with this
  purchase</Text>
  <Text category="music">I have seen Joe many years ago when he had
  played in a group called bloodline and he is even better
  now</Text>
  <Text category="music">This album gives me goosebumps. I got it
  because of Eric Dolphy, but there is a lot more to listen to on
  this album than Eric Dolphy alone (though he's excellent as
  usual). The inclusion of Booker Ervin gives the album the perfect
  texture, as his style in many ways contradicts that of Dolphy.
  Although the styles are different, they complement each other
  perfectly. Mal Waldron is a great composer, and many of his most
  excellent ideas appear on this album. The song "Thirteen" is a
  fine example...you'll just have to listen to it. Everyone on this
  album smokes. Get this...you wont regret it</Text>
  <Text category="music">If you liked the original Clerks
  soundtrack, then you're sure to love this. Thirteen years after
  we heard Randall and Dante rant and ramble on about
  hermaphrodites and name-calling during sex on the first Clerks
  soundtrack, now we are blessed with the opportunity to hear these
  two anti-heroes discuss other pointless issues like racial slurs
  and which movie trilogy is, in fact, the REAL trilogy. And we,
  the Clerks fans, get to hear these meaningless dialogues in
  between every music track. Oh, and did I mention the music?
  Terrific! Kevin Smith's choices are so fitting for each scene in
  the movie. It's not too difficult to imagine that Kevin has been
  thinking about these track choices for a long time. In typical
  Kevin Smith fashion, the usual array of artists are included as
  well as some cool surprises. You've got your typical Soul Asylum
  and Alanis Morrisette as well as King Diamond and an unexpected
  Jackson 5 dance number. If you have not seen the movie, please
  make sure to do so before purchasing the soundtrack. Doing so is
  sure to give the songs so much more meaning as you listen to
  them. Overall, a really good soundtrack compilation that is sure
  to please any Clerks fan.</Text>
  <Text category="music">I am not Jewish, but you don't have to be
  to enjoy these songs. This album happens to be one of my
  favourites of the Putumayo releases. A couple of the songs were
  instantly familiar to me even though I thought I knew none of the
  songs when I bought this album. Each and every song on here is
  wonderful...some are traditional folk songs while others are
  newer compositions. The 23 page booklet includes a 3 page history
  of Jewish music, and each artist has a page about them, including
  a photograph. I highly recommend this album to just about
  everyone. My husband is Arabic and he too loves these songs.

  <Text category="music">I recently discovered Joyce Cooling. Yeah,
  I've been in the dark ages. She is one of the smoothest
  guitarists out there and she does not try to sound like everyone
  else. I especially appreciate her percussive use of intonations.
  She's got chops galore and is a beautiful woman to boot. You can
  hear it all in her music. Buy Revolving Door! You'll love

  <Text category="music">Good old silly, irreverent Slade never
  really caught on in the US, but their melodic early-70s glam rock
  sounds as energetic and fun today as it did back then, and this
  is the best collection of their works, including all of the
  Slade's hit singles from the early '70s, from 1971's
  &amp;amp;quot;Get Down And Get With It&amp;amp;quot; to 1975's
  &amp;amp;quot;Thanks For The Memory (Wham Bam Thank You
  Mam)&amp;amp;quot;. Slade scored a whopping 11 Top Five hits
  between 1971 and 1974 (five of which topped the charts), and
  they're all here. So are their latter-day chart entries, like
  1983's #2 hit &amp;amp;quot;My Oh My&amp;amp;quot;, but Slade
  never got better than they did at their stomping glitter-rock
  peak, and &amp;amp;quot;Feel The Noize&amp;amp;quot; captures
  them in all their glory, filled with Noddy Holder and Jim Lea's
  big, dumb, misspelled shout-along hits (&amp;amp;quot;Look Wot
  You Dun&amp;amp;quot;, &amp;amp;quot;Mama Weer All Crazee

  <Text category="music">I have only recently become a country
  music fan. I wasn't sure I would like Faith Hill, but this was
  the first CD of hers I purchased. From the very first song "This
  Kiss," I was instantly drawn into her music. What I love about
  her songs is that they are so real. "You Give Me Love" is so real
  and so strong. It's nice to hear a song that a woman sings about
  a man who is crying for a change. "The Secret of Life" has taken
  some getting used to. It is not my absolute favorite on the CD.
  "Me" is the song that means the most to me since I have
  experienced trying to change for someone else in a relationship.
  And "I Love You" is a heart-jerker for those who have loved
  someone from afar. She has a big voice, and she nails each song
  on this CD. Give it a try</Text>

  <Text category="music">This cd has alot of tight hits including:
  Nann by Trick Daddy and Who Dat' by J.T. Money. There are too
  many good songs to name for this cd, those are the biggest I like
  and I like all the others too. I can practically just listen to
  the whole cd without stopping it, which usually never happens
  with other cd's b/c u buy it for about 3 good songs and all the
  other songs are junk. But this cd has all the Hip Hop Hits that
  it proclaims. I suggest anyone looking at this review or cd, to
  buy the cd. It's worth it, definetely! One last word is that you
  will have no regrets buying this cd at all I think in my own
  opinion.I am from St. Louie and I am telling ya'll to look out
  for a new group called NELLY also, there hit single is already
  out &amp;amp;quot;Country Grammar&amp;amp;quot; and cd soon to be
  out. Get that when it comes out to. Peace out ya'll</Text>
  <Text category="music">This disc dates from Monk's early period
  before he achieved recognition and started to descend into a long
  series of formulaic recordings for Columbia. So it's valuable
  from that point of view. It's also a wonderful chance to hear him
  showcased without horns although the standard is perhaps not
  quite as high as the trio Blue Note recordings that immediately
  preceded it. The best tracks both from a musical and recording
  quality view point are an extended Blue Monk, which many consider
  the definitive version, and a lovely unaccompanied Just a Gigolo,
  which anticipates later solo masterpieces such as Alone in San
  Francisco. Sweet and Lovely is in a similarly reflective vein.
  Much of the rest of the album has a forceful, driving quality,
  with aggressive use of dissonance in places - even for Monk. A
  particular highlight is Monk tearing through These Foolish
  Things</Text>
  <Text category="music">As a collector of musical scores, I

  a must</Text>
  <Text category="music">this is a very well done record by 3 of
  Raps most elite personalities. Cube, Dub, &amp;amp; Mack
  definitely knew what they were doin when they made this record.
  The beats are amazing on all the tracks. This is one you can
  listen to straight through and not feel any need to hit the skip
  button. For me all these songs were hot from the first time i
  heard them. If you're a fan of the whole West Coast gangsta rap
  thing, You GOTTA HAVE THIS! My Fav tracks are "All the Critics in
  New York", "Do you like Criminals", "Gangsta's make the World go
  Round", "Westward Ho!", &amp;amp; "Hoo Bangin'"...although like i
  said, all the tracks are badass. peac</Text>
  <Text category="music">Tosca's Suzuki is not breaking any ground,
  but by God they have mastered the art. This album is just so
  professional sounding, very nicely produced. This is how I
  envision trance to sound like, so much garbage out there it taked
  a while to sift through and find a golden little record like
  this. Funky bassbeats and killer sounds. It's what they call
  ethereal....I think. It flows so well from track to track, quite
  the odyessy in under an hour</Text>
  <Text category="music">Immerse yourself in the incredible genius
  of Mark O'Connor and his amazing chameleon-like creative ability

  - this is for you. If you like foot tapping fiddle with a Celtic
  slant - then this is for you! Classical? Jazz? Blues? Country
  Rock? Then yeah - you guessed it - this is for you! This is an
  absolutely fantastic album - a brilliant collection of melodies
  that bring together some of today's greatest violinists. Pure
  Genius</Text>
  <Text category="music">Right, so, you're reading this either
  because you are a big Oasis fan and realize that this album is
  wonderful, or because you've heard some Oasis songs on the
  ever-disappointingly-dull radio and it's sparked yer interest.
  "The Masterplan" is a compilation of Oasis B-Sides that have been
  released over the years. What has always made Oasis the best band
  in the world is the fact that the songs that they include on
  their "albums proper" are not necessarily their best songs. As
  such, songs like "Acquiesce", "Talk Tonight" and "Stay Young" are
  vacant on their albums, yet they represent the best of this
  lovely band and are included here in stunning fashion. So in
  summary, I absolutely do not recommend you buy this album until
  you at least own and fall in love with "Definitely Maybe" and
  "Morning Glory". To those who own and love this album, it is a
  part of rock history and is not to be overlooked.</Text>

  note with an elegance of its own and keeping the piece lyrical
  yet still rhythmically precise. Although his interpretation is
  Romantic, the spirit is all Bach with no egoism on the part of

  and Fournier's smooth interpretation is one of the most moving
  recordings available</Text>
  <Text category="music">Wow! I love this spykids movie way better
  than the first one. I think of the first one as an introduction
  for the characters and the sequel is the big adventure for all
  the Cortezes and even more characters, like the Giggleses. We met
  Donnagon in the first movie, and he was the reason for the Cortez
  parents to go on the mission. Now we see that he has kids and we
  relize that he has bigger plans for the OSS. And what about
  Alexandra, the preisidants daughter? She is the main reason we
  know about the transmooker device, right? Also grandma and
  grandpa Cortez are joining us in this movie. I think Robert
  Rodregiuz did an execallent job on the sequel, Spy Kids 2: The
  Island of Lost Dreams. ... The sequel is awesome!!!!</Text>
  <Text category="music">Can't really add much to the reviews. This
  is one of those albums that increases in listening value as it
  gets older. I'll admit that when this came out in '94, I only
  bumped the singles. It didn't grab me at the time. Sometime
  around '97 I gave it a spin and I've been loving it ever since.
  There are plenty of bangers on the album, but classics like "Pour
  Out A Little Liquor", "Str8 Ballin' ", "How Long Will They Mourn
  Me", Cradle To The Grave", and "Under Pressure" make this album
  worth owning all by themselves. The rest of the songs are on
  point too -- there isn't much filler on this album. The
  production is handled by Warren G. &amp;amp; Nate Dogg (1), the
  awesone yet underrated Easy Mo B (1), Johnny J (1), Jay &amp;amp;
  Mopreme (1), Jay &amp;amp; Syke (1), Stretch (1), and Thug Music
  (4). I'd say that all contributing producers turned in dope
  tracks. The only tracks that I would call skip material are "Sh**
  Don't Stop" and "Don't Get It Twisted". "Sh** Don't Stop" is
  probably the most lazily produced track on the whole album and
  the lyrics are unimpressive. The production is on "Don't Get It
  Twisted" cool, but it's one of those songs that you have to be in
  the mood for it (in my opinion). Volume 1 is a passionate, if at
  times misdirected, release from the Thug Life camp. The
  production is nothing short of vintage mid 90's Cali vibes. It
  holds up very well 13 years after its release. Of course, if
  you're a Tupac completist, you probably have this album already.
  But even if you're not a Pac fan, this should be a part of your
  collection. R.I.P. Tupac Standout Tracks: How Long Will They
  Mourn Me feat. Nate Dogg, Pour Out A Little Liquor, Str8 Ballin'

  <Text category="music">MariaS and Srayle, if you like the
  Guaraldi original then keep it and chuck the Winston, Personally,
  I think the Winston performance is refreshing and a delightful
  'twist' on Guaraldi's works. The piano is brillaint sounding and
  at volume, thru a good system sounds like there's a piano in the
  room. It should be emphatically understood, you are buying
  Winston in this case, and not Guaraldi. I have both

  you listen. This is one of the most peaceful Christmas CDs I have

  <Text category="music">Sony / Legacy does a fine job with this
  compilation, BUT it could've been much better IMO!! Here's what I
  did to improve this CD (fans can do the same thing!! There's
  enough CD space available!)... Include the FULL LENGTH VESRION of
  'Encore' (the single mix has to GO!), and add the following RARE
  BONUS TRACKS... 16. 'At Last You're Mine' (fr.'Heavenly Bodies'
  SDTK 1985) 17. 'Steppin' Into The Night' (fr.'Armed &amp;amp;
  Dangerous' SDTK 1986). The single version of 'Got To Be Real' is
  fine because it includes Cheryl's trademark "Soo-Hoo, Soo-Hoo"
  vocal break that's absent on the longer album version. All in
  All, I'd recommend this CD to anybody that wants the best Cheryl
  Lynn compilation, but serious fans WILL want more!! 'The Best Of
  Cheryl Lynn, Vol.2' has been LONG OVERDUE for years, but you may
  have to make that one yourself until Rhino does the job! Peace,

  <Text category="music">This movie was a favorite in our household
  and my daughters always enjoyed the karaoke a the end of the DVD,
  so we searched for the soundtrack. I actually chose this volume
  over volume 1 for two reasons...it contains the favorite from the
  movie, "I want to grow old with you" actually sung by Adam
  Sandler and secondly, because Volume 1 contains the song that
  Adam Sandler sings about his ex-girlfriend, which contains quite
  a bit of profanity, so I didn't want to get it for my kids. I
  would have given it five stars, but we find the introduction by
  Billy Idol at the start of the last track, "I want to grow old
  with you," which is dialog from the movie, to be distracting and
  it gets tiring to have to listen to over and over when you just
  want to hear the song, which I mentioned was the absolute

  <Text category="music">I am 62 years old, and seen them all. I
  have NEVER seen anyone as visually and emotionally stunning as
  Beth Hart at the Paradiso! Simply the most powerful stage
  performance I have ever witnessed! She takes every single song to
  an epic level of entertainment, and just plain never coasts
  through a song. Some of the spectators in attendance looked
  almost scared by what they were seeing, and most were mesmerized
  by her on-stage and off stage sexually potent antics! She has
  been compared to Janis. I saw Janis twice, and Beth Hart would
  bury Janis in any category! I can't imagine how she can possibly
  maintain a level like that captured at the Paradiso for very
  long--it just doesn't seem humanly possible! I am so glad someone
  was there with so highly skilled a video crew to capture one of
  the most shattering evenings of music ever. Magnificent in its
  fury!</Text>
  <Text category="music">I first heard this album in the late 6o's
  when it was originally released. Starting with the first track,
  &amp;amp;quot;Blood of the Sun&amp;amp;quot;, I was hooked.
  Leslie West was and has been a vastly unnoticed guitarist
  treasure. His throaty singing and driving band, featuring Felix
  Pappalardi, made this band one that should be placed on the list
  of &amp;amp;quot;great ones&amp;amp;quot;. Probably due to the
  many other better publicized bands, like Led Zeppelin and the
  like, Leslie West and Mountain seemed to get shoved away into the
  closet. Open the closet, you guitarists out there, and give this
  CD a try. I don't think you will be anything but delighte</Text>

  and think he was a truely protean genius who was the grandfather

  <Text category="music">I have followed the Enigma project for a
  long time, and haven't found myself disappointed with a single
  release thus far. (That is, considering I am reviewing an older
  album.) 'The Cross of Changes,' the second chapter in the Enigma
  project, offers philosophical insight into Micheal
  Cr&#239;&#191;&#189;tu's personal beliefs, in the form of an
  'enigmatic' symphony of soft composition and chanson. While each
  album seems to hold it's own unique interpretation of life, I
  believe the purpose of this album is to inspire love, peace and
  wholeness within its listeners. The lyrical value of 'The Cross
  of Changes' seems to surpass that of its instrumental quality,
  which is, at times, rather poor in comparison to some of
  Micheal's other works. However, the lyrics are reassuring and
  inspiring, none-the-less, and make the entire experience
  worthwhile. Buyers who are curious about Enigma probably
  shouldn't start with this album, as it seems to be one of those
  things you appreciate only after hearing some of the latter
  releases. (In my case, at least.) The first album I purchased was
  'Love, Sensuality, Devotion' (the greatest hits album) -- a good
  start, considering you will get a fair idea of what Enigma is all
  about. By the way, I am curious about track number 2 -- everytime
  I listen to it, I faintly hear Sandra chanting "open your heart,
  and push the limits..." in the background, though it could just
  be my imagination. It's strange that I mention that, because
  'Push the Limits' was released after this album</Text>

  <Text category="music">Sometimes, debut albums present an artist
  in full bloom, with an assured grasp on their sound and message.
  Sometimes, debut albums are nothing but promise, pointing toward
  what the artist could do. Public Enemy's gripping first album,
  Yo! Bum Rush the Show, manages to fill both categories: it's an
  expert, fully realized record of extraordinary power, but it
  pales in comparison with what came merely a year later. This is
  very much a Rick Rubin-directed production, kicking heavy guitars
  toward the front, honing the loops, rhythms, and samples into a
  roar with as much in common with rock as rap. But, damn if they
  don't sound like they've already conquered the world! Already,
  there is a tangible, physical excitement to the music, something
  that hits the gut with relentless force, as the mind races to
  keep up with Chuck's relentless rhymes or Flavor Flav's spastic
  outbursts. And if there doesn't seem to be as many classics here
  -- "You're Gonna Get Yours," "Miuzi Weighs a Ton," "Public Enemy
  No. 1" -- that's only in comparison to what came later, since by
  any other artist an album this furious, visceral, and exciting
  would unquestionably be heralded as a classic. From Public Enemy,
  this is simply a shade under classic status</Text>
  <Text category="music">What can you say about MFL that hasn't
  already been said. Sublime, perfect, classic. This is still the
  definitive recording of the show, and no one has ever come close
  to the original cast. Sadly, while the movie is wonderful, had
  Warner Bros. used Andrew's it might have been one of the greatest
  film musicals of all time. And while Audrey Hepburn gamely gives
  it her all, Andrew's had clearly made Eliza Doolittle her own,
  and she would have been uncomparable on film, and raised the
  level of the entire movie. Well, the rest is history, Andrews
  went on to be one of the biggest movie stars of the 60's. Still,
  probably the best example of a play being adapted into a musical.

  <Text category="music">I just love this CD. Over 8 years ago my
  much older coworker turned me onto this album. It is definetly
  not just for St Paddy's day. This is an album you can listen to
  over and over. The Sinead songs are a bit whiney, but she does
  have an excellent voice. You can not get better that Mic and
  Sting. Sting's song is just incredible.</Text>
  <Text category="music">I'm not sure what to call this CD other
  than genius. This was the first CD I've heard from Sonata Arctica
  and it's still my favorite. I'm not really really big on power
  metal/epic metal, but I defintely enjoy SA and Kamelot. With that
  said, I think this CD can even entertain those not interested in
  power metal. My friend enjors radio rock and rap, but after
  hearing me play this CD where we work, he begged me to make him a
  copy. Towards the actual CD, i'm not quite sure I can put what's
  in it into words. Songs like Silver Tongue and Broken have a very
  distinct, unique sound. The ballads, Draw Me and The Misery are
  both superb efforts, each making the listener feel Tony Kakko's
  pain. My favorite song would have to be a dead heat between The
  Misery and Gravenimage. The keyboardist in this band works in
  overdrive in each song. He plays fast, and keeps the melody in
  each beautiful and interesting (and lighthearted at times). The
  guitarist plays very fast when he needs to, and the right power
  chords other times. He's quite good. Overall, the sound they
  eminate is as uplifting as it is rocking. They do a great job.
  The lyrics seem much better than older releases (english
  lessons?) but still can be a bit odd. "...with long haired
  drummer in band" springs to mind. Still at least they write about
  mundane things... I love Kamelot, but the Knight in Shining armor
  routine will get old eventually. Anyway, the vocals are very well
  done, he obviously quite talented and the band harmonizes quite
  well, too. (They'd make Queen jealous!) Overall, I can't praise
  this CD enough. Every song is an adventure, none of them a
  tedious or unnecessary one at that. I would say that anyone could
  enjoy this CD, but I'd first recommend it to those who are tired
  of the American screamfest metal that's going on today. Then I'd
  recommend it to power metal fans, and so on. Simply put, this is
  one of the best CDs I own. Give it a chance</Text>
  <Text category="music">A great recording. "The greatest bass solo

  <Text category="music">The Best of Taste compiles material from
  their 4 official albums released from 1969-72. The albums
  consisted of two studio albums &amp;amp;quot;Taste&amp;amp;quot;,
  &amp;amp;quot;On The Boards, and the two live albums
  &amp;amp;quot;Live Taste&amp;amp;quot;, and &amp;amp;quot;Live At
  The Isle Of Wight&amp;amp;quot;. This band was a power trio led
  by Rory Gallagher before he disbanded the group to embark on a
  successful solo career. The band led by Gallagher on vocals,
  guitar (electric, acoustic, &amp;amp;amp; slide), harmonica, and
  alto sax specialized in hard hitting blues rock. The music has
  much in common with Cream. However, the Richard McCracken and
  John Wilson could not compete with the stellar musicianship of
  Jack Bruce and Ginger Baker. The undervalued Gallagher is an
  unsung guitar hero whose work compares favorably with that of
  Eric Clapton. Like Cream the band favored extended versions of
  tunes like &amp;amp;quot;Sugar Mama&amp;amp;quot; and
  &amp;amp;quot;I Feel Good&amp;amp;quot; included here. The music
  included here is varied. It ranges from the slow gut wrenching
  version of &amp;amp;quot;Catfish&amp;amp;quot; to the more
  acoustic cover of &amp;amp;quot;Leavin' Blues&amp;amp;quot;. The
  cuts from &amp;amp;quot;On The Boards&amp;amp;quot; become more
  jazzy at times. Tracks like &amp;amp;quot;On The
  Boards&amp;amp;quot; and &amp;amp;quot;It's Happenened Before,
  It'll Happen Again&amp;amp;quot; highlight the band's more
  improvisational approach. Hard hitting tracks like
  &amp;amp;quot;Eat My Words&amp;amp;quot; spotlight Gallagher's
  outstanding slide technique. Two cuts I miss from this period
  which are not included here are &amp;amp;quot;Dual Carriageway
  Pain&amp;amp;quot; from &amp;amp;quot;Taste, and
  &amp;amp;quot;Morning Sun&amp;amp;quot; from &amp;amp;quot;On The
  Boards&amp;amp;quot;. The live concert favorite
  &amp;amp;quot;Sinner Boy&amp;amp;quot; provides a bridge to
  Gallagher's solo career as the studio version was included on his
  first solo album &amp;amp;quot;Rory Gallagher&amp;amp;quot;. This
  anthology provides a great overview of the early work of Irish
  blues-rock guitar hero Rory Gallagher and his battered
  Stratocaster. It is even more essential as the four original
  albums are only available as imports</Text>

  joints like SAY GAL and SEX AND VIOLENCE are gems also. Filler:
  NONE! Bottom Line: BDP's six album is still a classic with a
  message that still isnt heeded till this day. Besides the slammin
  production, Krs showed that he was 100 steps ahead from the
  average rapper with this album. Any born again hip hop head would
  do well to start off with Edutainment and work their way down to
  this album.</Text>
  <Text category="music">Originally released in 1972,this was Can's
  fourth record as well as their follow-up to 'Tago Mago'(see my
  review).Some really superbly written and played cuts here to
  fully take in(might take several spins)are "Pinch",liked Michael
  Karoli's(R.I.P.)stellar guitar solos,the somewhat stunning
  "Vitamin C" and this reissue's lengthiest track,the ten-minute
  "Soup".First rate German progressive kraut.After I listened to
  this CD a second time,I realized that 'Ege Bamyasi' may have very
  well been a heavy influence on later bands like Gary Numan,Pere
  Ubu,Public Image Ltd. and Stereolab.Silly cover,don't you
  agree</Text>

  found its way out since the new millenium. I am partial to good
  songwriting and Bill's particular folk-country-alt-emotive sound.

  <Text category="music">Several tunes on 'Back to Oakland' feature
  Tower of Power at their best. One in particular that keeps me
  coming back is the deeply funky instrumental track, 'Squib
  Cakes'. Featured soloists include a short, mellow guitar solo
  from Bruce Conte, followed by Greg Adams' fluegelhorn that first
  lurks in the pedal range (leading one to believe it's a
  trombone!) and then soars brilliantly higher and higher to a
  dramatic finish. Tenor madness abounds from lead saxman Lenny
  Pickett (known primarily for his work as lead Tenor for the
  Saturday Night Live band), wailing in-tune in the difficult
  altissimo range (jazz musicians call these 'freak notes' because
  they are not notes typically included in the range of the
  instrument ... ), while at the same time refusing to compromise
  on excellent rhythmic and melodic ideas throughout. Chester
  Thompson completes the soloistic foursome with a chunky Hammond
  organ solo that takes you back to a smoky bar in LA in the early
  70s - without the probability of cancer. Lyrical yet
  hard-driving, Thompson lulls us first into his solo space by
  filling in behind the band as they chant 'Squib Cakes', then
  takes off on his own flight, delving out perfect 16th-note runs
  as though Bach suddenly had learned some jazz Hammond himself. In
  the middle of the solo, as if to a testament to the tightness of
  the groove, Thompson lingers on a treble note in his right hand,
  chunks out chords so symmetrically with the rest of the rhythm
  section with his left, that in the days of hearing this on vinyl,
  I wondered if my record was skipping through that section! To
  finish the groove, at the end of Thompson's solo, the horns
  return to fill in a bridge with quick triplets. After he closes,
  we're back to the head to close out the tune. Even with so much
  to savor, this syncopated gem will leave you hungering for more,
  even after the final stroke of the last chord. The musicianship
  and tightness of their groove more than make up for the bland
  lyrics on the album's other tunes. I have listened to this album
  for 30 years and revel in its freshness every time I spin it. I
  recommend it as a definite primer for anyone wishing to explore
  Tower of Power's "sound." - Kathryn Shut</Text>
  <Text category="music">I loved the CD, it took me back to the
  days of the original recordings, however the sound was not as
  good as the original.</Text>
  <Text category="music">This was 2Pac's last good album before he
  joined Deathrow.He was a good rapper but never the best,he
  started too much beef with other rappers for no reason.He had
  alot of beef with east coast rappers like Biggie,Nas,Jay-Z and
  Mobb Deep,but he never opened his mouth about Wu-Tang because
  they would lyrically destroy him.This is one of the best albums
  from 95 right behind Gza's Liquid Swords and Mobb Deep's The
  Infamous</Text>
  <Text category="music">On this album,Ice switches to a thrashcore
  style lovers of the style will go mad about.The songs are mega
  fast,with furious social lyrics and full of hatred.If you're into
  thashcoreand dig bands like Ratos De Porao,get this one at
  once.It suffers from some degree of dynamic compression
  though,but if you can correct that,it'll blow your brains againt
  the nearest wall</Text>
  <Text category="music">its quite difficult to sum up the impact
  of this cd with few mere words. suffice to say, level 1 is a
  timeless classic, in fact, it was my entry pass into the realm of
  d-n-b. logical progressions level 1 is a must-have for all d-n-b
  heads &amp;amp;amp; music lovers in general. demon's theme,
  western, danny's song &amp;amp;amp; horizons remain some of my
  favorite songs in any genre. bukem's level 1 displays his
  flawless production &amp;amp;amp; track mastery which cascades
  the listener with the ideal mid-tempo balance between dance-floor
  adrenaline &amp;amp;amp; ambient bliss</Text>
  <Text category="music">I'll begin by saying this isn't the only
  "Ministry Of Sound Chillout Sessions" I've heard, in fact I love
  the MoS brand, so I can honestly say that EVERY single
  compilation has it's on flavour, from the "Clubber's Guide To" to
  "The Annual (Spring/ Summer/ Annual)" Which means, the previous
  and next instalments don't necesarily match this review. With
  that being said: This particular Compilation has a very elegant/
  european/ underground feel to it. It's indie electronica and some
  rock-gone-acid-jazz, and of course, it wouldn't be European
  without some House music. It's fascinating that in the middle of
  an elephant-driven craze a song talking about taking a holiday so
  someone can love someone better starts to blend seamlessly. Yes,
  it's THAT type of record. It's not Pop, it's not a 'greatest
  hits' mash-up and it's definately not boring. I remember the
  first time I heard it (I was working graveyard shifts at that
  time) I'd listen to the first cd and it'd make me fall sound
  asleep after the first half. It's not a bad thing, it's just very
  relaxing, very soothing to the soul (Specially the Lior song
  "This Old Love", which helped me get through a rather painful
  breakup) Overall, it's THAT kind of session. It makes you think,
  it makes you apreciate it, it's a 'life soundtrack' from track 1
  of the second disc ("we all live and die" from Kinda New) giving
  you a morning starter to the soothing track "Run (Jacknife Lee
  Remix)" on the first disc which invites you to THE promised
  dreamland. Nothing you'd expect from a regular MoS compilation,
  everything you'd expect from a really good chillout compilation.
  A MUST for any true Chillout Junkie</Text>
  <Text category="music">A true musical theater classic. Wonderful
  melodies that will last for years to come. Other classics not to

  about these great musicals</Text>
  <Text category="music">The debut release entitled "Breathe" by
  artist called Blue Stone is one of the best New Age albums that
  I've heard in years! I would even go as to say that it is even
  better than any of Amethystiums albums. "I Am" is heavenly and
  "Contact" is an eerie number that is destined to be a future
  classic!</Text>
  <Text category="music">The performances for every sonata and
  every partita are wonderful. This is the kind of material one can
  expect from Deutsche Grammophon. Wonderful music, a wonderful
  violinist, wonderful interpretations, and wonderful sound (not
  just for its time). There are also very few "squeaks" and he is
  almost always right on pitch! Often called definitive, this is
  the one to get. Highly recommended</Text>
  <Text category="music">The only problem with Betty Buckley is
  that she isn't nearly as well known as she deserves to be,
  considering the length and quality of her career. This album of
  somgs from her 1996 AIDS benefit concert at Carnegie Hall is
  simply flawless. Naturally, it's heavy on music from Broadway,
  the London stage, and film scores, but she sings one Mary Chapin
  Carpenter song, &amp;amp;quot;Come On, Come On,&amp;amp;quot;
  that comes from none of those sources and is guaranteed to give
  you chills every time you hear it. If you're tired of recordings
  by singers of little talent and less style, listen to Betty
  Buckley for fifteen minutes and you'll feel as if you'd never
  heard real singing before. She is an original, and she has the
  best voice in theater of this or almost any decade</Text>
  <Text category="music">This CD is a classic, a must for all those

  human voice. I am a voice major at a university. Nothing speaks
  to me more highly then choral music. I was a little skeptical
  about this CD when I first got it. I have since fallen in love
  with every aspect of it. Of course if you get this CD you must
  get the companion CD Lux Aeterna by the Los Angeles Master
  Chorale. You cannot have one without the other</Text>
  <Text category="music">All-instrumental collections of bluegrass
  are hard to find, and if you like it when a band takes a break
  from singing and just plays their instruments, here's your chance
  for total immersion. All the songs on this compilation are from
  Rounder Records albums released 1976-1998, by artists with
  familiar names like Alison Krauss and Tony Rice, and others you
  may never have heard of. All are first rate, foot stompin'
  renditions of bluegrass traditionals, with a few great originals
  -- Bill Monroe's &amp;amp;quot;Bluegrass Breakdown&amp;amp;quot;
  and Earl Scruggs' &amp;amp;quot;Foggy Mountain
  Chimes.&amp;amp;quot; Best known for most listeners is a rousing
  version of &amp;amp;quot;Orange Blossom Special&amp;amp;quot; by
  the Johnson Mountain Boys. If you like bluegrass with plenty of
  pickin' at breakneck speed, this CD will keep you smilin' through
  many, many replays</Text>
  <Text category="music">I am listening to Badfinger even as I type
  this review. This is the Best Of Badfinger Vol 2, and I thought
  volume 1 was great !! As previous reviewers have said, what an
  absolute tragedy the story of Badfinger is (Buy the Book "Without
  You" the tragic story of Badfinger). Well I have everything they
  have released, if you do buy any of the Badfinger best ofs, you
  will more than likely get hooked and start collecting all of
  their albums.Some of the best songs on this Cd are off "Wish You
  Were Here" their best album by a mile IMHO.In fact 6 of the 9
  songs on WYWH are on this compilation. They were such an original
  group with every member capable of writing an exhilirating hit
  song. just have a taste of "Just A Chance", "You're So Fine",
  "Meanwhile back At The Ranch/Should I Smoke".They were just so
  good, Damn I miss them</Text>
  <Text category="music">I really like this new singer, he has a
  style all of his own. I recently bought his new CD "A Swingin'
  Time" and I also had to have this, his first CD offered on
  Amazon. I'm really hooked on Monte Procopio's unique approach to
  these classic songs, can't wait for more</Text>
  <Text category="music">I never have understood how some people
  have an inate quality for music and some don't. Well , Willie was
  one of those that definately did. It is hard to imageine the
  blues without the likes of Willie Dixon: the writer, the
  musician, the producer, the businessman. I listen to his work
  over and over again , each time learning new nuances I did not
  hear before. How incredible is that</Text>
  <Text category="music">As one of the founding fathers of today's
  heavy metal rock music, Iron Butterfly has them power, drive, and
  sound that made them unique in the world of rock music. This live
  album serves as a testament to that fact. Eventhough the
  recordings of live concerts from the late 1960's through the mid
  1980's was primative at best (by today's standards), this live
  recording of Iron Butterfly captures most of the groups best
  music durring their prime as a chart-topping group of that era.
  This is a "must-have" for all Iron Butterfly fans</Text>
  <Text category="music">This is, I believe, the best Fleetwood Mac
  album ever record by the band. It begins with a nice quick paced
  tune, "Second Hand News" and proceeds to move into many textured
  songs from there. The album itself does not have a bad tune on
  it. In fact, of all the 'regular' albums from Fleetwood Mac
  (excluding Greatest Hits compilations), this album has more hits
  on it than any other. Hits like 'Dreams,' 'Never Going Back,'
  'Don't Stop,' 'Go Your Own Way,' 'The Chain' and 'You Make Loving
  Fun." All of these get enormous radio play. Moreover, 'Dreams'
  was a number one hit, and the Album itself held the number one
  slot for months on end, and has sold over 18 million copies in
  the U.S. and over 30 million worldwide, putting into the top 50
  best selling albums of all time. In fact, an interesting tid bit
  from the liner notes of the CD describe how the album had such an
  impact on America's youth that during that generation if you were
  to ask a student to spell 'Rumor' there would inevitably be two
  'U's' in the spelling. Now that is a very strong impact on
  culture. Every song on this album is arranged on the album as if
  it flowed right into the other making for an overall well rounded
  album. One of my all time favorite songs from Fleetwood Mac is on
  this album, "Never Going Back" which contains some great acoustic
  guitar work from one of Rock's premier guitarists, Lindsey
  Buckingham, and, in my opinion, the best Christine McVie song
  ever written, "Songbird." Now, with this release, you can also
  get, on a second CD, the various rough takes and outtakes of the
  songs on this album. This makes for great listening, to hear how
  the songs developed and were recorded. Moreover, early demos are
  included along with two 'Jam Sessions." Now, more than ever, this
  is a must have CD for any lover of Rock music (or music in
  general for that matter). If you are a Fleetwood Mac fan, then
  chances are you own this album, but if you are just getting
  introduced to the band, then you must buy this CD. I highly
  recommend it</Text>
  <Text category="music">Have loved this album since it first came
  out years ago (bought on vinyl - lost to the mists of time). The
  CD was out of print but I kept looking and found it on Amazon (it
  was re-released), Yeah!!!! Last Steam Engine, From the Cradle to
  the Grave, Louise, Owls, You Don't have to Need Me - some of my
  favorites. This, to me, is Kottke in his prime</Text>
  <Text category="music">I don't know where this guy gets off
  saying that the drummer, Jorge Rossy, and the bassist, Larry
  Grenadier, &amp;amp;quot;are competent but do nothing overtly
  interesting&amp;amp;quot;. Jorge incredible groove, use of space,
  and musicality is as good as one could ask for, and Grenadier's
  huge warm tone, amazing time, and great thematic development is
  unparalleled by other bassists of his generation</Text>
  <Text category="music">I finally got this cd, I have been looking
  for this CD for awhile now, a great by well worth it</Text>
  <Text category="music">Along with Son Volt's
  &amp;amp;quot;Trace&amp;amp;quot; and Nadine's
  &amp;amp;quot;Downtown Saturday,&amp;amp;quot; this is one of the
  best rock albums of the 1990s and certainly one of the best
  alt.country albums ever released. Standout tracks include
  &amp;amp;quot;Blue Canoe,&amp;amp;quot; &amp;amp;quot;Soul
  Sister,&amp;amp;quot; &amp;amp;quot;Eyes of a
  Child,&amp;amp;quot; &amp;amp;quot;Wink&amp;amp;quot; and
  &amp;amp;quot;Let's Go Runnin'&amp;amp;quot; all examples of
  first class rock songwriting. The rest ain't too shabby either.
  Fans of the Allman Brothers and Lynyrd Skynyrd in particular
  should give this Mississippi band a listen. But so should any
  mainstream rock fan</Text>
  <Text category="music">This is Beck's coming of age album.
  "Loser" was a single that was designed from the bottom up to be a
  hit single and "Mellow Gold" landed Beck right smack center of
  mainstream pop culture for an entire generation. His earlier
  recordings, featured in an album entitled "One Foot In The
  Grave," were evidence enough of his musical genius. "Mellow Gold"
  might have represented an electro-acoustic adolescence for Beck.
  If that's the case, then "Mutations" was his rite of passage, a
  moment of maturation that moves beyond the playful
  tongue-in-cheek wittiness of his previous album. "Mutations" has
  dark, brooding moments with haunting melodies. His lyrics inspire
  curiosity and sadness. In one song, he sings, "Looking back on
  some dead world, that looks so new." We can't always be sure of
  his references or implications, but the music in this album is
  fascinating and darkly beautiful. His ambiguity of language is
  infectious and the compositions that he rests his words in are
  dynamic and graceful. With "Mutations," Beck has secured an
  important place in music history. This is a body of work that
  really goes far beyond album sales and radio play. The arrival of
  this album shows us an artist finding a moment of clarity and
  touching the world with his craft.</Text>
  <Text category="music">I can only say that this was my favorite
  record of last year. This record is hard to find in your local
  record store, so search it out... Incredible - can't wait to hear
  more!</Text>
  <Text category="music">I bought this because I thought this cd
  would be nice to listen to in the car while on out and about. I
  love that our 2 1/2 year old daughter who is from China loves
  this cd and will request it "Chinese Flute" please. This is just
  one way to keep her heritage alive and expose her to different
  kinds of music beyond the Wiggles &amp;amp; Lilo &amp;amp; Stitch
  CD. I would have liked to have had more information on the songs
  like what province of China. But not having this information
  really does not lessen the rating of 5 stars! Our family thinks
  this is an excellent cd</Text>
  <Text category="music">With Freddie backed by Herbie,Ron
  Carter,and Tony Williams.This is high-flight crisp and inspiring
  music.Worthy of repeated listenings. Listen and enjoy.Williams is
  over the top,very creative and will continue to suprise you with
  his unceasing inventiveness.I've always noticed how Carter and
  Williams really spur Hancock on as you will notice in this
  set.Hancock,one the the truly great pianist of post-bop
  era,sounds like he is his having the time of his life.It doesn't
  get much better than this.</Text>
  <Text category="music">Stiff Upper Lip is a good AC/DC album,
  it's not a great AC/DC album. It kills me when people say that
  AC/DC have sounded the same since 1973 on every album they have
  done. Nothing could be further from the truth. I have always
  thought that each AC/DC album has a sound and a feel and a story
  in it's own and that a track off each album would be totally out
  of place on another album. For instance, can you image Shake a
  Leg on Stiff Upper Lip? Or Ballbreaker on Back in Black? It
  doesn't work. Stiff Upper Lip has its own kind of rough, bluesy
  feel to it. Brian's voice sounds different, the tones and the
  guitars sound different. It's good but not great. The
  standouts... 1. Stiff Upper Lip- Pretty rocking song. Has a good
  attitude. It's fun. 2. Hold Me Back and Can't Stand Still. Very
  odd rolling songs. They sound a lot alike. Again, these songs
  could NEVER have been on Back in Black. I have heard that Brian
  sang Can't Stand Still in one take, that's why they all clap at
  the end. I don't know if that's true, but it's an interesting
  song. 3. Satellite Blues- This one is an instant classic. I LOVE
  this song. This song could have been done back in the days of
  Back in Black and if it were on that album I think it would be as
  popular as You Shook Me All Night Long. Everything else is ho
  hum. Not good, not bad. Better than most bands out there. I am
  really hoping AC/DC put out a killer album with their new
  release, whenever that is. I hope they don't turn into the new
  G&amp;amp;R and suffer from the Chinese Democracy syndrome</Text>
  <Text category="music">this one came out in '91. its one of the
  very few albums that included the almighty Joe Preston on bass.
  one of the great things about this CD is that all the songs are
  all on one track. so it forces you to listen to this long,
  winding, sludgefest in its entirety. as most Melvins fans know,
  this (along with Houdini) was the pinacle of their musical
  career. after this, they made some great albums and some good
  ones, but never better than their self-titled album (previously
  titled "Lysol", but they decided to change it once they were
  threatened with a lawsuit). it would be ultra-cool if Ipecac
  records would give this album a deluxe re-issue treatment. it
  definitely deserves it</Text>
  <Text category="music">Released is the kind of album you put in,
  kick your feet up with a good beverage, and head off to someplace
  on the silverscreen of your mind that is pure tranquility.
  Oster's trumpet echoes on long after the music is off. Here's

  <Text category="music">Bo Diddley is one of the most underrated
  rock and roll artist. Such gems as &amp;amp;quot;Bo
  Diddley&amp;amp;quot; &amp;amp;quot;Say Man&amp;amp;quot; and
  &amp;amp;quot;Who Do You Love&amp;amp;quot; are just the tip of
  the iceberg. Add in the blues, like &amp;amp;quot;I'm A
  Man&amp;amp;quot; and you have a truely outstanding set. The set
  also includes a very informative booklet that includes a bio,
  pictures and discography. Do not settle for less than what is
  offered here</Text>
  <Text category="music">These 3 discs (there is a limited edition
  10 disc set which has obviously sold out!!)are a continuation of
  Live Dead. If you haven't heard the Dead Live then start with
  this or Live Dead. You will realise why to many they were
  America's greatest improvisational rock band. The playing, the
  interplay between the musicians - particularly Garcia and Lesh is
  staggering. And how about a big hand for Bill Kreutzman on
  drums</Text>
  <Text category="music">If you're a fan of Latin music and
  especially Spanish guitar, you will LOVE Cafe Tropical. Every
  song is different from the next with instrumentation ranging from
  guitar, to piano, violin, trumpet, and a whole host of spicy
  percussion instruments. Every time I put this CD on I hear new
  things, which I find makes for an even more enjoyable listen. As
  usual, Johannes Linstead delivers some of the most catchy and
  memorable melodies in the nouveau flamenco genre, and of course
  his guitar playing speaks for itself. Highly recommended</Text>
  <Text category="music">This guy is amazing. I keep playing this
  for people and they love it and tell me they have never heard
  anything like it. I even got a huge discount at the auto shop for
  just having this CD. After the mechanic took my car from the
  parking lot and listened to one minute of this, he came in and
  said "that sounds crazy! you have to let me copy this" After
  getting a nice chunk of cash taken off my bill, this cd already
  paid for itself and never collects dust. I know everyone compares
  Clark to Aphex Twin, Boards of Canada, and Autechre, but for good
  intentions. He is already that good, after just a few
  releases</Text>
  <Text category="music">Few "metal" bands can successfully
  integrate melody into their music without falling back on the
  overused "power ballad". Tesla seems to be able to turn it on
  when needed, and shut it off when unnecessary. This debut from
  the Sacramento quintet is full of enough speed to satisfy any
  metalhead, yet also contains enough substance to satisfy those
  who want more from their rock than double kicks and 140 on the
  metronome. The album starts off with a great rythym section
  groove, then growing and ripping into EZ Cum EZ Go, a song that
  takes the listener up and down more often than a Valencia theme
  park ride. Comin' Atcha Live seems destined to be the song that
  the band opens their live shows with, falling back into the
  rif-filled melodic offering of "Getting Better". Then the pace
  swells again into "Too Late For Love", and thunders into the
  anthemic fist-pumping "Rock Me To The Top". "We're No Good
  Together" may start like the dreaded power ballad as Jeff Keith
  laments about the proverbial one that got away, but screams to a
  conclusion through a profusion of lightning fast (pun intended)
  guitar solos. "Modern Day Cowboy" is the token political anti-war
  statement, slows down a bit for "Changes" but up next is one of
  their fans' favorites. "Little Suzi" begins with a tasty acoustic
  piece, and progresses into the culmination of the bands' melodic
  songwriting talents as they chronical the ups and downs (pun
  intended) of a young starlet discovering the high costs of fame.
  I'm a little surprised at the way the album closes, though. After
  the huge highs through the middle of the album, the final three
  cuts are somewhat disappointing to me. Don't get me wrong,
  they're still decent, but I would have liked these three shifted
  to the middle of the album and slid the rest towards the end -
  "Little Suzi" would have been a great way to end the album.
  Overall, even though the band did a lot of great stuff (including
  their biggest commercial success) in later albums, this remains
  their best body of work</Text>
  <Text category="music">No doubt about it, from start to finish,
  this is a classic for anybody's collection. I can remember back
  in the spring of '93 when the movie came out and it was a classic
  as well but the soundtrack matches up to what the movie was and
  this soundtrack sent a big message to a lot of us about what goes
  on the inner cities today. This was rap music at it's best from
  Spice 1 to DJ Quik. There will not be a soundtrack like this ever
  again that addresses what goes on in our neighborhoods. So add
  this to your collection if you still love the true gangster rap,
  west coast fan(like myself), or just want to hear a great
  soundtrack</Text>
  <Text category="music">Eddie's first all-studio recording, and
  the album that got me hooked. I must say that even though they
  are uncomparably fantastic live, this album demonstrates the
  range and diversity of Eddie from Ohio. &amp;amp;quot;Oh My
  Brother&amp;amp;quot; is a particular favorite with Julie Murphy
  Wells displaying her amazing range and beautiful voice, and
  Robbie Schaffer's talent for emoting the absolute best of a
  heartwrenching situation. If this song doesn't touch your heart,
  you have no appreciation for music. A particular plus on this
  album is a beautiful violin solo of &amp;amp;quot;Yerushalyim
  Shel Zahav&amp;amp;quot; by guest musician Pete Wilson on
  &amp;amp;quot;Jerusalem,&amp;amp;quot; another song by Robbie,

  <Text category="music">"Burnin'" was the last album by the
  Wailers as a collective group, afterwhich Peter Tosh and Bunny
  Wailer left the group to pursue solo careers and Marley reformed
  his group, calling it "Bob Marley &amp;amp; the Wailers" in 1974.
  The album shows the original three at their best, balancing lead
  vocals on several songs between Bob Marley, Bunny Wailer, and
  Peter Tosh. The album not only serves to further reveal Bob's
  soon-to-be legendary work, but also to show the talent of Bunny
  Wailer with his lead vocals on songs like "Hallelujah Time" and
  "Pass It On". The album also shows Tosh taking lead with Marley
  on "One Foundation" and alongside Marley on "Get Up, Stand Up".
  The album's biggest gem, however, was "I Shot the Sheriff," soon
  to be made a favorite in the U.S. and the U.K. by rock artist
  Eric Clapton on his 1974 "451 Ocean Boulevard" album. The deluxe
  edition also features a concert from the tour in Leeds, U.K. just
  one week before the Wailers broke up. (Bunny, however, was
  already absent, having refused to tour outside of Jamaica once
  and for all earlier that year. His temporary replacement,the
  Wailers' old vocal coach, Joe Higgs was also absent, quitting the
  tour after they completed their shows in the U.S.) 1973's
  "Burnin'" shows the original Wailers at their very best before
  their breakup and is a timeless classic for music fans

  <Text category="music">The Afro-Eurasian Eclipse is a
  groundbreaking suite, full of intriguing new sounds and grooves.
  Ellington didn't fade into predictability and mundanity in his
  last years; instead, his compositions became more and more
  original and exciting. This suite has rocking, swinging, waltzing
  grooves that, though seemingly disparate, work together and
  illustrate the theme stated in the Duke's spoken introduction to
  the suite: to show that "the whole world is going Oriental, and
  that no one will be able to retain his or her identity... not
  even the Orientals." Duke doesn't leave his standbys behind,
  though. The phenomenal playing of Ashby, Carney, Jones, and the
  rest of the Orchestra keeps The Afro-Eurasian Eclipse firmly
  rooted in virtuosity, even when playing to new grooves, melded
  with African, Asian, and Australian rhythm and sound. On a
  personal note, this is one of my favorite CDs. Aside from the
  remarkable music, it gets bonus points for the spoken
  introduction, at the beginning of the "Chinoiserie" track. Audio
  notes give the listener a greater understanding of the CD,
  especially one with a single focus, like this one.</Text>

  game from the late 80's). Overall, though, Grieg's greatest hits
  is a must-have for collectors of classical music. Grieg is
  revered as Norway's greatest composer of all time and he
  certainly has a knack for creating imagery of bustling fjords and
  majestic mountainsides with interlaced river ravines.</Text>

  <Text category="music">I got Secret Story as a Christmas present
  last year. I had asked for Imaginary Day, because the only tune I
  had heard from Pat Metheny was "The Roots of Coincidence," and I
  was itching for more. I still couldn't wait to hear what was on
  Secret Story, but I was hoping it would be in the same vain as
  The Roots of Coincidence. What I ended up hearing was an
  incredible CD with a vast scope, filled with emotions that change
  from tune to tune. Searching for tunes to sound like Roots was
  not successful; instead, I joyfully found a complete and very
  unique set. I agree with others that for maximum experience you
  should have enough time to listen to it in one sitting, straight
  through. The musical roller coaster is the most extravagant when
  done this way. I found myself trying to pick out favorite tunes,
  but I ended up picking ones for only a particular "mood" (such as
  an upbeat or sedative one). I could just as easily pick a few
  different tunes for another mood. That's why it's fun to listen
  to it straight through: no other album of mine gives me so much
  in so little time. Of course, Metheny has apparently mastered the
  flow of the tracks, too: one leads right into the next, creating,
  oh, maybe a "story?" I don't know the story, but it's a lot of
  fun to make up a different story each time you listen to it. I
  guess the tune that I most like to play, no matter what mood I'm
  in, is "Cathedral in a Suitcase," with it's mesmerizing
  3-against-2 beat and a well-crafted three-chord progression that
  it revolves around. Tunes range from the euphoric (Cathedral,
  Finding and Believing, Facing West, The Truth Will Always Be), to
  the sweet (The Longest Summer, Sunlight, Always and Forever), to
  the smooth (Rain River, Antonia, As a Flower Blossoms, See the
  World), to the calm and reflective (Above the Treetops, Tell Her
  You Saw Me, Not to be Forgotten). Of course, this is all the
  tunes, and it makes for such a satisfying experience. Since this
  is my first Metheny CD, I am definitely going to pursue more.
  Metheny seems worth my time and money</Text>

  <Text category="music">Tears for Fears was not the average 80's
  pop band, even if they looked like it on the surfice. They used
  synthsizers, drum machines with a meliodic and hook laden sound.
  But the music itself was often melancholy and they brought up
  serious issues like family values like few contemporary bands at
  the time had the guts to sing about. Tears for Fears got their
  name from Arthur Janov's primal scream therapy and they band
  consisted of Roland Orzabal and Curt Smith, two highschool
  friends from Bath, England. Roland was the writer of most songs
  during the career while they both were co-singing. Some of the
  music may sound a little dated today (this being released in
  1983) but the touchy subjects they bring up are still present
  today. The opener and title track is a great pop song and at the
  same time a good introduction to what is coming, it's about
  children suffering without anyone noticing or caring. Tears for
  Fears trademark was mixing good pop with serious subjects and
  they really succeeded with that. "Mad World" was one of the big
  hits and recently covered by Gary Jules and taken back to the
  charts again as the sountrack for "Donnie Darko". The moody
  alternative song brings up the sad reality we're living in, a
  world without rules or morals and the people suffering from it.
  Excellent and haunting ballad. "Pale Shelter" was originally
  released in 1982 but failed to make it big on the charts, so the
  song was re-recorded, remixed and re-released and the result was
  a big hit even for "Pale Shelter". The song is slow paced and
  distinct with guitars, synthesizers and percussion. It brings up
  the lack of love some children get cause of bad parenthood.
  "Ideas As Opiates" is almost minimalistic, it basically only
  feauture percussion and slow piano sound, the lyrics are also
  sparse. "Memories Fade" is also a stripped and melancholy song,
  with it's haunting lyrics and saxophone it's one of this album's
  highlights. "Suffer Them Children" is a synth laden pop song
  about children with problems growing up cause they're ignored and
  not given too much love. Watch Me Bleed" got very strong lyrics
  "Heaven comes to he who waits/ But I know Im getting nowhere/ And
  all the deeds of yesterday /Have really helped to pave my way"
  and is overall another great pop/rock song. "Change" was one of
  three big hits on this album, it got a trademark marimba sound
  and a great hook which paved the way to the charts. The song is
  focusing on the destructive behavior of a loved one. "The
  Prisoner" is the darkest of songs with some very strong lyrics
  and arrangements suited for a horror film, the lyrics are sparse
  and they're almost whispered. The last song is called "Start of a
  Breakdown" feautures a catchy synthesizer sound and meliodic
  percussion. Why this song was not released as single is beyond
  me, but it's one of the best songs. This remastered version
  feauture remixed of Pale Shelter", "Mad World" and "Change and
  the non-album song "The Way You Are" is present. It's another
  fantastic song by the way. Uptempo with great percussion
  arrangements. Nice it was added. Overall, Tears for Fears
  magnificient debut was one of the most daring and thoughtful
  albums of the 80's. It's equally intellegent and beautiful full
  of good lyrics and great arrangements. With this remastered
  version you get better sound + bonus tracks and the non album
  song "The Way You Are". Some of the songs may sounds a little
  dated today, considering all the new equipment used in today's
  music, but the lyrics and subjects they brought up are just as
  present in today's society. This album may get a little too
  personal and the lyrics get frightening when you listen closely
  to them at times, however if you're a music fan that likes smart
  lyrics and lyrics that make sense then this is something for you.
  It's a concept album and it very thoughtful and sincere. One of
  the greatest debuts of the 80's, let alone albums.</Text>
  <Text category="music">I caught Sonny in a live performance this
  past November, so I got to hear at least 3 tracks off of his most
  current album...Sonny Please. He opened the set with a fiery
  "Sonny Please" which smoked for a good 15 minutes (I believe that
  Victor Lewis was on traps that night so the percussion section
  helped do the driving). For a man approaching 77 years of age, I
  was impressed with not only Sonny's playing and gracious
  presence, but his stamina in performing two 40 - 50 minute
  sets...trust me, the man can still play! This album may not be
  another "Saxophone Colossus" or "The Bridge", but it is a solid
  recording and should satisfy a majority of Sonny's fans. If you
  have no recorded music by this jazz legend, this CD is a
  respectable starting point</Text>
  <Text category="music">The first cd from Baby Anne is fairly
  typical florida breaks fare. I wouldn't claim that's a bad thing,
  but don't expect to be surprised if you're familiar with the
  genre. Overall it's a solid offering from Baby Anne and delivers
  the bass. The second cd is a surprising mix from Jen Lasher, who
  has abandoned her old breakbeat sound and fully adopted a more
  electro feel. To those who have labeled this "industrial" I will
  say first and foremost that you are wrong. There is not one
  remotely industrial track on the cd. What she does provide is an
  extremely varied mix of synthpop, house, and a couple breaks
  tracks, all very vocal and sporting an electro pop flare,
  sometimes approaching the full-on ny electroclash sound. From
  someone quite familiar with electropop artists I can't recommend
  highly enough this diverse mix guaranteed to please newcomers and
  electro afficianados alike. My only complaint is the strikingly
  misplaced Wolfsheim track, which I can only assume fueled the
  misguided and completely false Depeche Mode comparison from
  another reviewer.</Text>
  <Text category="music">Darren Aronofsky's movies are beautiful
  masterpieces. From "Pi" to "The Fountain", going through "Requiem
  For a Dream", they will forever stand as timeless jewels. So they
  are hard to top in any way, but Clint Mansell has been able to do
  it every single time, scoring each of them. For "The Fountain",
  he teamed up once more with Kronos Quartet and had Scottish
  post-rock band Mogwai join in too, to produce a score that fits
  the movie like a glove, in a very organic way. The central theme
  to the movie is instrumented in a way that works fantastically
  well across all the time periods the movie encompasses. The
  combination of the talents of Mansell, the Quartet and Mogwai
  yields a relatively dark, yet breathtaking musical piece that
  will stand the test of time much like the movie it was meant to
  score</Text>
  <Text category="music">We really liked the CD of music from the

  <Text category="music">This album has some of the best country
  songs in the business. Mark sings songs straight from his heart.
  There are songs for every occasion from the slow ballads like
  &amp;amp;quot;Too cold at home&amp;amp;quot;, &amp;amp;quot;I'll
  think of something else&amp;amp;quot;, and &amp;amp;quot;Almost
  goodbye&amp;amp;quot; to the fast, heels kicking
  &amp;amp;quot;Bubba shot the jukebox&amp;amp;quot;, and
  &amp;amp;quot;Going through the big 'd'&amp;amp;quot;. These
  songs are about real life realtionships and how they affect the
  heart. So if you're in the mood to cry about that lost love or
  smile now that they're gone this is the album for you</Text>
  <Text category="music">Another typical funk classic album from
  the brilliant tenor sax sounds of Lou Donaldson. The album
  released on Blues Notes features Lou's popular and individual
  classic jazz funk tones. Lou even opts to 'chill' out on a number
  called 'Over The Rainbow' but on other numbers like 'Donkey Walk'
  Lou's style and also his unique band really shine. The
  unmistakable hammond adds yet more funk and along with the jazzy
  guitar sound and funk and swinging drums this brings together
  another great album.Keep on funkin Mr Lou Donaldson!!!!</Text>
  <Text category="music">Do I mean the best album or the best
  singer? You are correct if you said both! I saw Kristin Chenoweth
  on a PBS show "Broadway's Best at the Pops," (though it was not
  the first time I had heard her) and decided to check out the
  offerings here. This is a collection of the kind of music and
  performances I love. She has a great range, a precise pitch, and
  a great style that is at the same time true to the music and to
  herself. In an era when singers try to outdo each other
  re-interpreting the composer's original work, not usually with
  great success, she is a blessing</Text>

  <Text category="music">The Best R&amp;amp;B Band Ever!!! I know
  some will disagree with me, but this is the band that really rock
  my boat. I mean, they were awesome and it wasn't forced or fake.
  The rawness of their funk is sooo addictive that you will never
  put this cd down. I am in the process of getting ALL their cds,
  but this one is a great way to be introduce to their music</Text>
  <Text category="music">Like it says in the ("33 1/3") liner
  notes: "...world class chops and originality". If jazz is your
  bag and guitar licks get your attention, these tracks will set
  off fireworks! My music collection started circa 1960, but these
  guys made it to the top of my list in a heartbeat! If I could,
  I'd give it 10 stars</Text>
  <Text category="music">Hermann Baumann is one of the greatest
  horn players ever and he shows why he has been given that honor
  on this cd. I don't think that there is recording of the Haydn
  concerto that even comes close to this masterful performance,
  even better than Tuckwell's. The cadenzas are absolutely awesome.
  I haven't listened to the Rosetti before but Baumann sounds
  excellent in this concerto as well. Clevenger plays ok on the
  Haydn but his articulation is a little sloppy. I'm a saxophone
  player but I can recognize true musicianship when I hear it and
  Baumann certainly is a brilliant musician. Highly
  recommended</Text>
  <Text category="music">This is one of the truly great Handel
  opera recordings of the last twenty years. As usual, Nicholas
  McGegan proves himself to be one of the two or three greatest
  Handelian conductors of our time. The singing from beginning to
  end is first class. This opera is known for the famous largo
  "Ombra mai fu," but the music in this entire performance is a
  sheer delight</Text>
  <Text category="music">Although a couple of reviews said this was
  a great product, I was wary as I have never found anything that
  actually worked. I have a job where my mind is always on the go,
  and often have a week or two a month where I just can't get to
  sleep. The CD arrived during one of these times, I put it on my
  portable CD player not expecting too much, and almost imediately
  felt a bit queazy, nothing too bad, and on later research this
  basically proves the Delta wave theory Dr. Thompson is working.
  The only time in the past when I have gone to sleep so easily
  when I have been out partying all night when I was younger. I
  play the CD on a stereo I have in my room, and I rarely wake up
  at all. I am certainly going to buy more of his CD's</Text>
  <Text category="music">While Photek was (and still is) reknowned
  for his minimalist approach to breakbeats and electronic sound,
  his approach changes significantly on
  &amp;amp;quot;Solaris.&amp;amp;quot; Starting off with the first
  three tracks, his beats still retain some of the stattacco nature
  of his earlier work (especially on &amp;amp;quot;Modus
  Operandi&amp;amp;quot;), but sound more full, more resonant. The
  tracks where he wanders into the realm of House were quite
  repeditive, and despite Robert Owen's wonderful efforts (first
  time I've heard him), they were lacking. The best track on the
  album, and one of the best Photek works is definitely
  &amp;amp;quot;Infinity.&amp;amp;quot; The rumbling bass really
  cuts right to the core, and reminds me a little of Source Direct.
  The trip-hop efforts are good for his first attempt at such
  music, but the more ethereal &amp;amp;quot;Halogen&amp;amp;quot;
  left an impression. A wash of sound that previously Parkes would
  be itching to rip apart with a snare roll, it comes off much
  better for the lack of any true form. Not a great album, but
  solid and indicative of where Photek would like to go in terms of
  his future works</Text>
  <Text category="music">Love.This.Album. EVERY song is awesome!

  <Text category="music">As a kid, Out Of The Blue was one of the
  first albums (actually, 8-track) I paid for. That decision was
  made after hearing "Sweet Talking Woman" as a single, and after I
  bought it, the album grew and grew with me. Every few weeks, a
  different set of songs stuck with me as memorable. The first few
  weeks, it was "Sweet Talking Woman," "Turn To Stone," and "Mr.
  Blue Sky" (all pop perfection); the next few weeks, it was "Wild
  West Hero," "Across The Border," and "Jungle." After three
  months, there wasn't a corner or edge of the album I didn't know
  and like. Thirty years later, the remastered CD finally comes
  around and, through the fan club at [...](Which I heartily
  recommend because of their labors of love) I bought this and
  Balance Of Power (review coming). I have to say I was a little
  scared to put this on again after all this time as my tastes of
  music have evolved and the label of "pretentious" has been placed
  on them by my 16 year old son ( a prog rocker, nonetheless). A
  big sigh of relief--the CD holds the same joys it did before. The
  Moog synthesizer riff by Jeff Lynne in "Turn To Stone" still
  pumps the heart, while "Sweet Talking Woman" and songs like "Wild
  West Hero" and "Jungle" still delight. But I'm amazed at how
  things like the "Concerto For A Rainy Day" (four songs including
  "Mr. Blue Sky"--still the brightest jewel on this album) still
  hold together, and songs like "Stepping Out" and "Sweet Is the
  Night" step up to dig their hooks into you even today. While the
  remastering is very good and makes some tunes step up ("Across
  The Border"'s horns beg you to crank them up), there are a few
  drop outs ("Night In The City" has a couple), and of course, my
  tastes probably don't translate to everyone. But, my 16 years old
  has given the album a careful listen, and he hasn't returned it
  to me yet--I imagine for the next few weeks I'll still enjoy
  listening to "Out Of The Blue" from downstairs for a few more
  weeks..</Text>
  <Text category="music">The title track is one of the best country
  songs ever performed proving the talents of Hank as a true
  caftsman when it comes to song writing. Fitting that category as
  well are Outlaw Women, and Women I've Never Had. Hank also lends
  his southern rockin' style to White Lightnin' written by J.P.
  Richardson a.k.a. the big bopper. What Bocephus album would be
  complete without at least one tribute to his father? Hank serves
  up a whopper here along with Waylon Jennings in a classic called
  The Conversation. In a time, much like today, when country was
  straying from it's roots Hank finds a way to keep the southern

  popped this cd in the player, and was instantly floored. what
  great melodic, poweful tunes filled my ears. i'm not much of a
  ballad fan, but even those are great. Dean Castronova on drums
  was the perfect choice for this type of release, as he adds the
  power to Schonn's precision. this is how Neal would have played
  with journey, had the suits let him do so. the Gioeli brothers,
  unknown to me at the time, do a masterful job as well. it's such
  a shame that great bands make an album or two, and just fade
  away, ie. Lynch Mob, Badlands and these guys, to name a few. this
  release is far superior to their second offering, but that one is
  pretty tasty as well. i suggest paying the coin for this cd, as
  it's worth every penny. Hardline 2 will run you about twice as
  much, but imports often do. get 'em both if ya' can, but this one
  is the best of the 2. peace.</Text>
  <Text category="music">Being quite the fan of Grace Slick,
  Jefferson Airplane, and other 60s groups, I bought this album
  only having heard two songs on it--"Daydream Nightmare" and
  "Outlaw Blues". At first I was a little puzzled--The Great
  Society sounded different than any band I'd ever heard before.
  After listening to it about two more times, I realized this
  uniqueness was a good thing! They sound a little rougher than
  your average 60s band, and they were--Grace, her first husband,
  and her brother-in-law assembled this band out of a few of their
  friends and it only was around for about a year. The Great
  Society definitely isn't a band for everyone, but if you love
  interesting-sounding music, want to hear some of the earlier
  forms of psychedelic rock, or are just curious about how Grace
  Slick sounded before the *smoother* recordings of Jefferson
  Airplane, this is the band for you! A quick review of all the
  songs: Sally Go 'Round the Roses: A great way to open this CD.
  Pay special attention to the instrumental break in the
  middle--it's amazing! (Any time this group does an instrumental
  solo, it will be VERY good.) Didn't Think So: In my opinion, one
  of the weaker songs on this album, but a fine song just the same.
  Grimly Forming: An overall fantastic song to listen to with
  intriguing lyrics and another great instrumental section. (I love
  the tambourine--it adds an interesting air to the song.) Somebody
  To Love: Yes, here it is--the ORIGINAL version of the Jefferson
  Airplane hit, written by Darby Slick, Grace's brother-in-law.
  This has a much less *psychedelic* sound than the JA version, but
  they're both equally as good. Father Bruce: This is a very catchy
  song written about Lenny Bruce as if he were a preacher. Fun to
  sing along with. Outlaw Blues: This is a cover of a Bob Dylan
  song, I think. Grace's voice on this is incredible. Often As I
  May: Another fun song that's almost as catchy as Father Bruce.
  Arbitration: This song is mostly some great instrumentals but
  features some singing from David Minor (he did rhythm guitar, I
  believe.) White Rabbit: Yup, another original version of a JA
  song! This song's about 6:20 because there are 4 minutes of great
  guitar/sax playing at the beginning. Almost better than the JA
  version! That's How It Is: A cheery song with fun words. You'll
  definitely be singing this one aftewards. Darkly Smiling: This is
  another "weak link" on the CD. (There aren't many, thankfully!)
  It does have some interesting lyrics, though. Nature Boy: Grace's
  singing/recorder playing make this song memorable. You Can't Cry:
  This is a fun rock song, with the usual great guitar playing from
  Darby Slick. Daydream Nightmare: This is one of the more
  *psychedelic* and dark songs on the album, with great bass and
  guitar playing and more of Grace's recorder. This is definitely
  not a song to skip over. Everybody Knows: Also a fun rock song,
  and yes, another catchy one. Born To Be Burned: This song is a
  little less exceptional, but it does have a good bass line, and
  some good guitar. Father: A FANTASTIC way to end the album! This
  song is a nearly-seven minute long instrumental that builds up to
  an amazingly frantic crescendo. Not a song that will keep you
  bored</Text>
  <Text category="music">I agree with most of the reviewers that
  this band was very underated.great singing electric and acoustic
  guitar playing and great songs.why were songs like Natures Way
  and I Got A Line not huge hits?I Got A Line made the top 40 I
  think.Natures Way was a great acoustic ballad.also Nothing To
  Hide has a nice acoustic/electric section.also Mister Skin could
  of been a hit catchy.this band was better than a lot of the crap
  that came out in the late 1960's all the bad hippie bands of that
  era.as for the whole album I think it would get five stars if it
  had some live tracks as bonus cuts,like a live I Got A line or
  Natures Way live hearing that live would of been fun. I heard
  samples on a live Spirit cd.a great unknown band that everyone
  should give a listen to and to remember what real musicians and
  songs were about in the old days</Text>
  <Text category="music">Tunisian Anouar Brahem's "Le Voyage de
  Sahar" finds him in the same company- pianist Francis Courturier
  and accordionist Jean-Louis Martinier- as 2002's highly acclaimed
  "Le pas du chat noir." Having toured in support of that CD, the
  trio developed into a true group, something that Brahem
  accentuates to great effect on this program of new compositions
  and three favorites that are recast with the new ensemble. With
  "Voyage" Brahem continues a trend of creating music that is not
  as overtly "jazzy" as some of his earlier outings. Nonetheless,
  he remains a master a crafting deliciously vivid, richly
  evocative compositions that distill Arabic music and European
  jazz sensibilities with a warm, sonorous chamber music vibe.
  Among the ports of call on this "Voyage" are "Zarabanda," whose
  elegant lope recalls the French Riviera. Elsewhere the title
  track exudes mysticism tempered with intrigue, while "Cordoba"
  and "Ete Andalous" are meditative pieces with a decidedly
  cinematic scope. The gentle bounce of "Nuba" and introspection of
  "Les Jardins de Ziryab" both include uncredited but effective
  passages of voice. Rarely do you hear music this gorgeous</Text>
  <Text category="music">I originally purchased this CD at a local
  store. So many of my friends and family loved it that I ordered 4

  <Text category="music">1990. It dosen't seem like that lond ago.
  When a barley known Mariah Carey stuns the world with a powerful
  5 octave voice that hasen't been heard since Minnie Ripperton.
  She made her appearance when she signed on to Columbia Records
  after the now forgotten Brenda K. Starr, whom Mariah was a backup
  singer for at the time, gave Tommy Mottola a demo tape of her
  songs and the rest was history. Now about the album. The album
  starts off with her first single "Vision of Love" a powerful song
  that spent weeks atop the charts and made Mariah a star. You can
  feel the suspence as Mariah builds up to the bridge and gives the
  world their first hearing of her beautiful 5 octave voice. Truly
  to this day, still one of her best songs. "There's Got To Be
  Away" changes pace from love to world issues that are still
  relevent today. This was released as a single in the U.K. (it
  wasn't released in the U.S. for fear that it would break her
  string of four number one hits) yet it failed to chart. "Someday"
  is the next song and was the albums third single. It too hit
  number one in 1991. This song is great to hear after a breakup as
  Mariah warns an ex-lover that "the one you gave away will be the
  only one your looking for." This song may seem a little out dated
  now as it still has some heavy 80's synth beats. "I Don't Want To
  Cry" was the albums fourth and, in the U.S., the last release. It
  too hit number one in the summer of 1991 and within a year Mariah
  had a whopping four number one hits under her belt. Something
  that will not be accomplished for a long, long time. Though
  Mariah has declared her hatred for the song as she fought over
  the production of the song and was dissatisfied with the final
  product, the song still has all the work of a great Mariah song
  and it is the only song that Mariah does not hit her famous
  whistle register with. "Vanishing", though never becoming a
  single, is probably one of the best Mariah recordings. A gospel
  like song with amazing vocals over a pounding piano is enough to
  make anyone think their in heaven. Though the song is spookey
  enough at the chorus when she softly coos "swiftly you're
  vanishing, drifting away." It has also been called a "hidden
  treasure" by many reviewers. "All in Your Mind" is another song
  that realy showcase Mariah's vocal capabilities. Though this is
  one of the few songs that sound dated, but definatly worth a
  listen. "Alone in Love" is a song that is soft and pleading would
  make anyone run back to Mariah. Truley a Mariah great. The next
  two songs,"You Need Me" and "Sent Up From Above," really are the
  weakest tracks on the album and do bring down the feel of the
  album. They also sound dated and are not the style in which
  Mariah is famous for. Still, every Mariah song is worth a listen,
  so go for it! "Prisoner" is a truley a great Mariah tune. Though
  this has a rock influence as well, she does a great job with the
  vocals and the lyrics stay insode your head. This almost became a
  single in the U.S. but Mariah finished her new album quicker than
  originaly planned. "Love Takes Time" truly will have a place in
  my heart. Every time I hear this song it takes me back to 1990,
  almost like a little time machine. Putting this song on her first
  record almost didn't happen, as Mariah har intended it to be on
  her next record. Though Tommy Mottola and other executives
  persuaded her to. The style is not that different than "Vision of
  Love," where it build untill the brige where Mariah lets off her
  signature high note. This was also the second single of the album
  and became her second number one in late 1990. Though Music Box,
  Daydream, and The Emancipation of Mimi would go onto break
  records and are considered some of Mariah's best albums, there is
  no way you can leave this one out. This album truley is the one
  that started it all. To this date it has gone 9X platinum and
  made Carey into a star and would be the start of years and years
  of great music from THE voice of this generation. Though this
  album was heavily criticized for being to similar and formulaic
  to Paula Abdul, Janet Jackson, and especially Whitney Houston, it
  still ranks as one of the best albums of the 90's and of all
  time. For some people this album may be a time capsule of 1990
  and for others who are now expiriencing this music for the first
  time one fact will always be true. This is one of the best debuts
  and albums ever and was the start of a simple Long Island girl
  named Mariah Carey, who became a superstar.</Text>
  <Text category="music">This was one of the first Hiphop albums I
  ever purchased and I still listen to it today I think that krs's
  style was best suited to Primos production. Once he lost Primo
  (with the exception of a few albums) he couldnt hold it anymore
  musicly. krs didnt care about the latest trends in music or about
  bein a thug or topping the pop charts he just showed his
  incredible talents on the mic and stomped all the wack MCs that
  deserved it. This was also the album that introduced the world to
  krs as a solo artist and he proved that he had plenty of
  ammunition left from his BDP days as well as few musical/lyrical
  tricks up his sleeve This album along with any other BDP release
  should be considerd mandatory listening for all you youngsters
  out there who are just getting into Hiphop this was the era that
  I belive Hiphop was the best about 93-98 its a shame that kris is
  doing the crap hes doing now I wish he would find a better
  producer or just stop doing albums and continue his carrer as a
  live battle rapper.</Text>
  <Text category="music">This truly is a masterpiece of pop music.
  There is not a wasted moment. The songs all blend together
  majestically one after the other. You really must listen from
  beginning to end to get the full effect. I agree with the
  reviewer that stated that 'Don't Look Back' is one of the best
  songs I have ever heard. I told a colleague that my heart melts
  when it plays. I don't mean to be gushing but this album stands
  apart. I had to put it away for awhile because it is somewhat
  addictive.</Text>
  <Text category="music">Gerry Beckley is "timeless". His new CD is
  awesome and seems to go back to his roots. His songs over the
  years last lifetimes and bring back amazing memories.This new CD
  just proves he hasnt lost his touch. Anyone who does not agree,
  doesnt know the real Gerry. I have had the privilege to meet him
  and talk with him many times, including being able to celebrate
  New Years eve with them after a concert with the rest of America
  and their families.He is one of the nicest people i have ever
  met, and his songs have always been a part of my life. I hope
  there are still many more CD's still to come and look forward to
  seeing him again in the near future in concert and
  afterwards</Text>
  <Text category="music">THIS IS A CD THAT EVERYONE SHOULD HAVE!
  THERE ARE FOUR GREAT VOICES AND THEY DO COUNTRY MUSIC THE WAY IT
  SHOULD BE! LORRIE MORGAN IS THE BEST AND I LIKE EVERYTHING ON
  THIS!! BUY IT AND ENJOY! CHERY</Text>
  <Text category="music">If you like the Beach Boys and appreciate
  the technical quality behind Telarc recordings, then this disc is
  a must have in your collection. First, Papa Doo Run Run does an
  excellent job covering Beach Boys tunes to the point where some
  people can't tell the difference, but you can still hear the
  uniqueness they bring to it. Second, you'll feel like your
  hearing parts of the music you've never heard before because
  there is so much more foundation and clarity to the recording.
  You can hear each instrument clearly. The beginning of
  &amp;amp;quot;I Get Around&amp;amp;quot; is almost explosive,
  they way the original recording should have been. Telarc and Papa
  Doo Run Run have made a special album here. When I feel like
  listening to the Beach Boys, I usually grab this CD first</Text>
  <Text category="music">I assume you already know what's on this
  recording or you wouldn't be here, right? Don't you probably have
  a thirty-year-or-so old vinyl copy of this that you haven't
  listened to for years because it's dusty and has scratches and
  pops and who listens to that stuff anymore anyway? Well, I won't
  review the music here because others have done better than I
  would, but I will say that listening to this remaster through a
  high quality set of headphones (Sennheiser) has enabled me to
  hear this as if it were the first time. It's totally worth the
  money to get this new version, and the bonus tracks just make it
  even more fun.</Text>
  <Text category="music">Joe Bonamassa is a blue/rock musical
  phenomenon that is awe-inspiring to anyone who will take the time
  to listen to his music. In his musical style/class, I would count
  him the second greatest musician on the planet - with Walter
  Trout weighing in first place. As you can easily see from all of
  the other reviews, I believe that you will find this CD well
  worth purchasing - as I have found all his material is. (After
  purchasing this item, I eventually went on to purchase everything
  he produced and haven't been disappointed.) As with any CD, you
  may not like all the selections but I believe the vast majority
  of his material you will. Among my favorites on this CD are:
  `Pack It Up', `You Upset Me Baby', and `Man of Many Words'.
  Bonamassa is an extraordinary adept and versatile musician. Since
  he is young and gifted, we can expect many more superb CD's in
  the future. Highly recommended</Text>
  <Text category="music">Does anyone know whether this set will
  become available on SACD or DVD Audio format? How would you
  contact GRP records to ask? I only give it four stars until
  multichannel format appears.</Text>

  <Text category="music">In August 1969 five session singers were
  invited to form a new session group. Main singer was Tony Burrows
  of Ivy League and Flowerpot Men fame. The first success came with
  the second single United We Stand. This CD collects together the
  three US hits of the session group plus the only US hit of the
  group that was the face of the session group in concert during
  1971-1973 and that would become the second outfit of the group,
  the Eurovision winning song Save Your Kisses For Me. The rest of
  the songs are a mix of songs from this second outfit 1974-1980.
  This outfit is still on tour at the end of the centur</Text>
  <Text category="music">First off, to the above comments, while I
  thoroughly enjoyed your well articulated history lessons, and
  would be interested to read other history lessons from you, you
  have to realize that this story is not directly based off of the
  300 Spartans at Thermopolye, but of the Graphic Novel. Now this
  is not to say that it is historily accurate in some sense, but
  the movie is tuned more to the direction of the graphic novell
  itself. **** Caution SPOILER ALERT ***** Besides that the
  Soundtrack is amazing and it is always a Joy to listen to a
  soundtrack that really captivates the real emotion of that
  particular scene, I especially enjoyed the music when they fight
  the "beasts" and it is really hard rock, and I especially LOVED
  the ending music when the entire Spartan Army is gathered and the
  one spartan is telling them to remember Leonidas (It is called
  Remember Us on the Soundtrack). May we all find our own "Glorius
  Death</Text>
  <Text category="music">"The Essential Jimmie Rodgers" is highly
  recommended for any serious country music fan. If anyone is the
  genuine article, it is Jimmie. Listeners will recognize some old
  favorites among the tracks including "Frankie and Johnny", "Mule
  Skinner Blues" and "T for Texas". There are also fine versions of
  "Waitin' for A Train" and "In the Jailhouse Now" though some may
  prefer Jerry Lee Lewis' version of the former and the Webb Pierce
  recording of the latter. The most interesting tracks are less
  well known. These include "My Old Pal", "My Old Sunny South by
  the Sea" and one devoted not to a mother but a father (!)-"Daddy
  and Home". For this reviewer, the album hit its high point on the
  final track, a mournful "TB Blues", a reference to the disease
  that took Jimmie's life at 35. While Jimmie's yodeling style may
  not be for everyone, this reviewer considers this album a safe
  bet. Keep in mind that JR was elected to both the Country and
  Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. Further, the "Essential" series of
  albums rarely disappoints. These almost always sponsor well-
  produced compilations of our past heroes best efforts. "The
  Essential Jimmie Rodgers" certainly falls into that
  category</Text>
  <Text category="music">I have to tell you Lionel Hampton has yet
  to be matched in talent, and drive on the "phones." Funny Story,
  it was Tito Puente the late and legendary " King of the Mambo"
  was the one who showed Lionel (by carefull persuation) the light
  of the "phones" and shuned him away from the piano. Unfortunatly
  not much was known on this subject of the two meeting but I
  believe they meet in the service or right after Tito was
  discharged for WW II. I can tell you Lionel, to me, is best know
  for His BIG version of "Flying Home". A bigger, badder version of
  the small groups version he did with Benny Goodman, and teddy
  wilson. Lionels closest match would have to be Red Narrvo form
  the 1930's, but still Mr. Hampton 's drive and moves on the stage
  has yet to be matched</Text>
  <Text category="music">For someone who knows little about Bach
  and wants to learn something, you couldn't do better than to give
  them this CD. Ormandy and the Philadelphia Orchestra give their
  signature warm, plush sound to the work of the great Johann
  Sebastian Bach, making him sound very nearly like a Romantic
  rather than a baroque or classical composer. This is not a bad
  thing--some complain that Bach, with his mathematical leanings,
  leaves them cold. That isn't possible with the inviting material
  on this CD</Text>
  <Text category="music">This is one of his older CDs, but one of
  my favorites. The music is smooth and wonderful to listen to.
  Great CD after a long day or to play on a special night</Text>
  <Text category="music">I have to say I was getting worried that
  John Adams was becoming a has-been. El Nino's first half was much
  better than the second, I didn't particularly like Transmigration
  and I defy anyone to listen to his 2001 piano work American
  Berserk and tell me it's any good. But after this release, I
  stand humbly corrected -- he's still, in my opinion, America's,
  if not the world's, best living composer. Dharma at Big Sur is
  scored for an electric violin and orchestra and uses a tuning
  system that's not well-tempered. What really makes this work
  special is the way the electric violinist plays soulfully and
  beautifully above the orchestra for almost the entire work in a
  sliding style I've never heard before in classical music. The
  first movement "A New Day" with its quiet and contemplative
  opening really feels like it's the creation of an entire
  universe. The climax of the second movement might be the most
  satisfying conclusion to any of Adams's works to date. Dharma is
  an absolute masterpiece. My Father Knew Charles Ives is wonderful
  too, even if it's not as powerful or moving as Dharma. The work
  is both an homage to Ives and a reflection of Adams' life.
  Clearly, Adams had a great childhood. The first movement,
  Concord, is playful -- the clearest tribute to Ives, since it's
  sounds structurarlly similar to his Fourth of July. The chaos in
  Adams' Concord is a little more rigid than Ives', but it's still
  fun. The second movement, "The Lake", features a beautiful
  clarinet line that evokes the composer's father. The scurrying of
  the last movement, "The Mountain", seems needlessly frenetic at
  times, but the cathartic ending that results of it makes the
  voyage worth it. My one bone to pick is with Nonesuch. The two
  works together represent about 52 minutes worth of music -- an
  amount that many would already consider stingy on a single CD,
  especially when other works like Guide to Strange Places go
  unrecorded. So why put these two works on 2 CDs? Is it to justify
  the $20 sticker price? An artistic statement to completely
  separate the two works? It just seems silly. But it's also
  forming a nasty pattern of sub-30 minute CDs that really should
  stop. People want to hear the astonishing sound world that Adams
  creates -- why try to limit it to 25 minutes at a time? Buy this
  disc, even if it's split into 2 pieces. It's the best of his
  works yet</Text>
  <Text category="music">I love almost all of these songs on this
  cd. If you want songs that grab your every emotion...this cd is

  <Text category="music">Ace rolls out its second volume of early
  girl and girl-led group sounds. This time, there are six tunes
  that did not make it into the top 100 and that may seem to be a
  bit of a letdown in content but when looking at the overall
  repertoire, this series still beats just about anything else of
  the genre out there. With enough (ten) top-10 songs to keep the
  music familiar, there are lots of seldom-found sides making the
  listening much more interesting and not sounding like every other
  oldies comp. Between such monster hits as Lesley Gore's
  pre-womens' rights anthem &amp;amp;quot;You Don't Own
  Me&amp;amp;quot;, the Exciters go-and-get-him &amp;amp;quot;Tell
  Him&amp;amp;quot; and Kathy Young's barely pubescent
  &amp;amp;quot;A Thousand Stars&amp;amp;quot; are cradled such
  rarities as the Secrets' &amp;amp;quot;The Boy Next
  Door&amp;amp;quot; (a Madara-White, of &amp;amp;quot;You Don't
  Own Me&amp;amp;quot; and other Gore tunes fame, composition ),
  April Stevens' &amp;amp;quot;Teach Me Tiger&amp;amp;quot; (later
  with brother Nino Tempo striking it big with &amp;amp;quot;Deep
  Purple&amp;amp;quot;) and Timi Yuro's (of
  &amp;amp;quot;Hurt&amp;amp;quot; fame) &amp;amp;quot;What's A
  Matter Baby&amp;amp;quot;. In this volume three of the tracks are
  acknowledged as having been lifted from disc but only track 10 is
  of substandard sound quality even so. Many of the tracks
  (2,3,6,8,12-15,17,23,25,28) appear in stereo, the remainder in
  mono. The 16-page booklet accompaning the disc provides pages of
  fascinating backround to the artists represented. Ace again hits
  the mark with this new compilation</Text>
  <Text category="music">Undoubtedly, Marnie belongs to the top
  list of Bernard Herrmann's best film scores, a wonderful musical
  image of Alfred Hitchcock's underrated movie. Written for small
  ensemble (strings, woods, harp and horns) Herrmann gives the
  music a wonderfully flowing mood, tasteful and delighted along
  with the dark characteristics in every second bar that Herrmann
  so masterful handles in all his works for Hitch. Joel McNeely's
  reading is simply stunning as ever, so is the performance, but I
  just don't like the overall acoustics on these
  Var&#239;&#191;&#189;se rerecordings with the large hall reverb
  giving the orchestra no room for details. They simply are
  overheard in this muffled sound. This is far from ideal for
  recording a film score and I bet Herrmann would not have liked
  this! But, it's a great, great score</Text>

  <Text category="music">I hesitated for so long to get this.
  Having followed Moby's rise since circa 1994 it has been amazing
  to watch what an impact he has had on music and on various
  cultural media over the years. I like his early techno/rave stuff
  and have enjoyed the gift he has for using electronica to score
  some beautiful and haunting hymns. But I wondered: has Moby gone
  soft? has he sold out? I was pleasantly surprised. Look at the
  cover and add rain. That's the overall mood of this album. I find
  rain to be cleansing on many levels, often building a mood of
  pensiveness, reflection and a fragile peacefulness. There is a
  glorious melancholy in the music, the lyrics and the singing on
  the album. Take the chilled out moments from Moby's other albums
  and build on it. That's what he's done here. Almost every song
  has singing - primarily Moby's longing, almost cyring, voice -
  and almost every song is for those rainy nights, when the world
  doesn't make sense, when longing for companionship and
  understanding burdens the heart, yet with a subtle hope
  underneath it all. It's downtempo, mellow, moody and sometimes
  sad. But it is beautiful. Don't expect "old" Moby, don't look for
  the commercial jingles of Play. Just put it on and listen</Text>
  <Text category="music">"Animal Farm" is a personal favorite of
  mine. And I dont understand why this song does't get more
  recognition - in my opinion, the most underrated song ever
  written (yes i know, its a bold statement). Theres something
  about Davies' voice in "Animal Farm" that makes this song
  unforgettable - particularly in this part: 'While I lay my head
  upon my pillow Little girl, come play beneath my window Though
  she's far from home She is free from harm And she need not fear
  She is by my side And the sky is wide So let the sun shine
  bright' The build up to Davies screaming "She is by my side" is
  really breathtaking. The title track and "Starstruck" are just as
  excellent. This album is a real treat and should be in
  everybody's collection</Text>
  <Text category="music">...yes, the Beatles by which I'm not
  comparing Supergrass to them. No, Supergrass are riding the road
  built by not only The Beatles, but other British rock'n'roll
  greats like The Kinks, David Bowie, The Zombies and many others.
  But the exploding energy of Supergrass delivers a deeply
  satisfying listen that does not exist as frequently in the
  present 2000's. This will definitely be a group that will
  represent the virtouso side of British rock'n'roll of the 1990's
  and 2000's, and without doubt represent the
  Bohemia-Intellectual-Hard Rocking spark that has lighten recent
  generations that has been going on since Circa-Sgt. Pepper. An
  intoxicating and highly addictive album. 100% recommended for
  anyone any age.</Text>
  <Text category="music">When I bought this cd I did not know that
  much about supergrass. The only songs I had even heard were
  "pumping on the stereo" and "sun hits the sky" and I liked both
  of these songs a lot. So while I was cruising the aisles in the
  record shop, my eyes caught a glimpse of Supergrass is 10, so I
  decided to buy it because it was at a great price, and I am glad
  I did. The CD has not left my car since I bought it two months
  ago. Every single one of the songs can get stuck in your head,
  and you won'tbe upset. From the opening track "caught by the
  fuzz" to the finale "Wait for the sun" the album just rock
  throughout, and everytime I listen to it I want more. The album
  clocks in at 71 minutes, but everytime I am done listenintg to it
  I feel unfulfilled. That is a sign of a band making great
  music</Text>
  <Text category="music">I had first bought the "Here and Now"
  hoping to hear the original recordings, but was slightly
  disappointed that on that CD the older songs were live
  performances only. If you want their hits as you remember hearing
  them on the radio or your old album that may be trashed, this is
  the CD for you</Text>
  <Text category="music">This is the best CD I have ever listened
  to! I highly recommend i</Text>
  <Text category="music">To start off i am a huge grateful dead fan
  and i have prabably about 150 cd's that cover many years of there
  carrer. This release is very good and worth buying. it has some
  great music on it and the price of the album is worth the eyes of
  the world with Branford Marsalis on the sax alone. All and all
  this was among my first bunch of grateful dead cd's that i got
  and it got me hooked so do yourself a favor if you are thinking
  about listening to the grateful dead and you want to hear
  something from the 1990 era buy this cd. But i would also get
  something from the 77 era too</Text>
  <Text category="music">Buy this CD now if you don't have it, it
  is an instant classic. The beats are banging, and fit Cougnut and
  C-Fresh's lyrics perfectly. The lyrics are tight, and touch on
  many different things. &amp;amp;quot;The Last
  Breath&amp;amp;quot; is real life song about death and injustice,
  and decisions we all have to make in life. &amp;amp;quot;Protect
  What You Hustle Fo&amp;amp;quot; is gangsta, about the individual
  struggle/hustle. &amp;amp;quot;Tell Me Something
  Good&amp;amp;quot; (remix) is even better than the West Coast Bad
  Boyz version with Master P. Its about real life in the
  ghetto</Text>
  <Text category="music">This Mos Def album is a good album to

  give his views on life, love, and this country we live i</Text>

  <Text category="music">The Clean kick-started the illustrious New
  Zealand label Flying Nun in 1981, providing a key blueprint for
  indie-rockers from Australia (the Chills) to California
  (Pavement). Over this two-disc, 46-track set of rarities and
  essentials, the trio takes the chugga-chugga racket of the Velvet
  Underground and stretches it into an entire garage aesthetic of
  excited, rudimentary playing, shaky, Kiwi-accented vocals and
  endearing melodies. Disc one, as influential for the lo-fi sonics
  as for the songs, ends with the Clean's 1983 breakup. Disc two
  spans their 1988 reunion and 1996's Unknown Country, mining
  similar material with even more exciting (and even
  better-sounding) results. But by then, lots of bands were doing
  what the mighty Clean had helped pioneer.</Text>

  <Text category="music">Vet producer Don Was is aboard for this
  one and he pushes the Ladies to write some of their most mature
  material, relying on their trademark humour as a flavoring rather
  than a sole ingredient. The result is that even the radio
  tailored material is better than on "Stunt". Best tracks here
  are: lovers sparring in "Too Little Too Late", twangy "Go Home"
  (possibly the only time you'll hear a country tune with
  glockenspiel. Parental warning: this is one you'll want to skip
  if young ears are in the car because of a gratuitous F-bomb at
  the coda..), the tale of a co-worker dalliance in
  "Conventioneers" that ends with them feeling awkward about it
  ("So I wait, come in late, It'd be great if you transferred out
  of state"), the cheater finally caught in "Humour of the
  Situation" ("Have you heard the one about the boy who moved into
  the henhouse to sleep? He woke up with egg on his face, When he
  found that all the hens had crossed the street") and the ethereal
  "Tonight is the Night I Fell Asleep at the Wheel", which utilizes
  an almost Disneyish melody in its tale of a man in a traffic
  accident who, disembodied, surveys his own demise ("In all the
  confusion, there's something serene, I'm just a posthumous part
  of the scene"). The least interesting tracks are "Off the Hook",
  another cheater gets him comeuppance tune and "Baby Seat", a
  gentle nudge to accept responsibility instead of wanting others
  to look after you. Bottom Line: While not as consistently
  fabulous as "Gordon", this one hits on all cylinders more than it
  misses and it utilizes more of the band's talents by allowing
  more lead vocals from Ed Robertson ("Pinch Me","Falling for the
  First Time"), as well as Kevin's first on the hidden track
  "Hidden Sun". You also hear the Ladies do things they haven't
  before: Steven's flute on "Tonight's the Night I Fell Asleep at
  the Wheel", Tyler's 808 drums for "Off the Hook", and a dash of
  retro courtesy of Ed's wah-wah pedal on "Conventioneers" and
  Kevin's vocoder on "Humour of the Situation"</Text>
  <Text category="music">This is one of those rare CDs that you'll
  leave in your car CD player for months and not get tired of,

  front of a fire on a rainy day with a nice glass of Oregon Pinot

  <Text category="music">This album is essentially a fusion of
  great musical minds. The legendary Khan payes more attention to
  making this a better experience for the western audiences of the
  Sufi music by playing more with his (brilliant) vocal skills then
  with the lyrics. Micheal Brooks' music stands out and enhances
  the experience further. This is not to say that the mainstream
  Indo-Paki audience won't enjoy this album ( This is one of my all
  time favs). It is fabulous background listening while doing work
  which may need focus - for those who need music to do such
  things... :) For those who have been thinking of testing out Sufi
  music, this is the place to start. This is a fine introduction to
  the great NFAK and Sufi music.</Text>
  <Text category="music">Despite the excellent screenplay by Sam
  Shepherd and the solid acting by Harry Dean Stanton, I found
  "Paris, Texas" a rather unimpressive film, and the only thing
  that kept it together for me was Cooder's astounding soundtrack.
  The music here is simple, yet very moving and even haunting. His
  guitar stylings really captured the mood and feel that the film
  was otherwise supposed to convey. It seems to seep right out of
  the desolate landscape of the Southwest. Every time I listen to
  this CD it reminds me of driving along some deserted highway in
  Nevada, SE California, etc. Also, it's really nice that the
  soundtrack contains the story ("I Knew These People") told by
  Stanton's character, since to me that was the best part of the
  movie. Even so, seeing "Paris, Texas" is not a prerequisite for
  enjoying this CD, the music is phenomenal in its own right</Text>
  <Text category="music">The first four albums are so unbelievably
  great that for me it's almost impossible to say one is better
  that the others. Taken together, they are almost like one long
  album. The Family That Plays Together shows the band turning a
  slightly more commercial corner without sacraficing any of their
  artistic integrity. Their blending of styles is a bit mote
  intergrated than on the first. Randy California's influence on
  the music was becoming stronger as well. One thing that differd
  Spirit from most of their comtempories was the strength with whch
  they were able to convey their songs in concert. I saw the
  original version 11 times and they never failed to astound me.
  It's a shame that the only legitimate live recordings of the band
  are of the later Ed Cassidy/Randy California version. Not that
  the later versions of the band weren't great - they just weren't
  quite as good as the original band. If your'e just being
  introduced to Spirit, The Family That Plays Together is a fine
  place to start</Text>
  <Text category="music">Eloy (name taken from H G Well`s Time
  Machine) is a German Atmospheric, Progressive Art Rock band that
  was formed back in 1969. Through the years, personal wise, the
  band has totally turned over, in some positions, several times.
  Their originator Frank Bornemann (guitars/vocals) has persevered,
  presiding over a three decade band, that has turned out some of
  the best progressive rock music, I've had the fortune to hear.
  OCEAN Ocean, their sixth album, released in 1977, is a concept
  album, depicting the rise and fall of Atlantis. Though there are
  only four tracks, they average almost eleven minutes each. Many
  Eloy aficionados point to this album as their `tour de force'. It
  is excellent, but as far as I'm concerned , based on what I've
  heard so far, there is no album that stands heads above the
  others. Overall, Ocean has an atmospheric ambience reminiscent of
  Hawkwind or a more unknown band that I once reviewed named Ship
  of Fools. It also reminds me Jeff Wayne's, War of the Worlds.
  Track listing 1. Poseidon's Creation (11:38) **** Has a long
  droning medium pace and a whinny guitar intro. At the 4:40 mark,
  Bornemann finally begins the vocal. There is quite a lot of
  guitar playing on this song, augmented occasionally by the synth.
  2. Incarnation Of The Logos (8:25) **** Has an atmospheric vocal
  beginning. The song doesn't seem to have much of a melody until
  the 3:40 mark when the synth/organ takes over with a pleasant
  one, assisted by some percussion and a bell now and then. 3.
  Decay Of The Logos (8:15) ***&#239;&#191;&#189; The shortest song
  at eight minutes seems a little jerky at first with more
  monologue than music. When it does get going after about three
  minutes it's still jerky in a medium paced beat. Strong synth
  playing through the middle. 4. Atlantis' Agony At June 5th -
  8498, 13 p.m. Gregorian Earthtime (15:35) ***** This is a monster
  song. It is like nothing I've ever heard. Except for a fifty some
  second monologue at the beginning, "Atlantis..." starts with a
  truly intriguing eight minute plus instrumental intro. Not just
  any intro, like you're used to, with a full orchestra and
  violins. No this is an spacey atmospheric intro that would make
  the great Pink Floyd, envious, with the propitious use of ghostly
  sounds and special effects segueing into an amazing five minute
  organ bridge, with no beat just the Hammond a few side effects
  and you. No it doesn't get boring. Instead it sets you up for the
  vocals, which issue forth at about the eight minute mark. Slowly
  the rhythm section establishes a slow beat, while the singer does
  a great imitation of Bob Dylan, with a remarkable spacey synth
  breaking in between the vocal. But we're not done. With about two
  minutes left, the band picks up the tempo to a medium fast tempo
  (the first time I`ve heard them play at this speed). Now the
  violins join in with the guitar and synth for the finale of this
  great finale. Total Time: 43:53 Line-up - Frank Bornemann /
  guitars, vocals - Klaus-Peter Matziol / basses, vocals -
  J&#239;&#191;&#189;rgen Rosenthal / drums, percussion, flute -
  Detlev Schmidtchen / keyboards, mellotron, xylophone, voice - The
  Boys Of Santiago / chorus (1) CONCLUSION One of the factors, I
  find appealing about this band, is that in the span of three
  decades, they managed to present a style of music which was
  compatible with each era, so listening to their albums from
  different periods gives us a window into the progressive music of
  various time periods. Eloy's musical tempo almost never exceeds
  medium and on Ocean tends to be more in the medium slow range.
  Listening to this and other Eloy albums I hear influences from
  numerous other bands. Like many prog bands I hear Pink Floyd but
  I also hear Uriah Heep, Moody Blues and Bob Dylan (really, on
  track four!)</Text>
  <Text category="music">Very good piece of music history. I still
  like the LP's sound a bit better then CD's due to some of the
  characteristic noise flaws but unfortunately LP's do not play in
  the car.</Text>
  <Text category="music">I remember hearing of this band when I was
  just a lad, but I never owned any of their albums, and none of my
  closest friends played this for me, so this is a great discovery
  for me. I'm only on my second listen, but it's already obvious to
  me that this is going to become a favorite. It's from my favorite
  rock period, the early seventies, and it's not only nicely
  remastered, it's also remixed, meaning they went back to the
  original multi-tracks, not the stereo master. I wish more
  reissues were done this way</Text>
  <Text category="music">Really enjoyed hearing all of them again.
  There is some great talent on here. I hope they all get their own
  opportunities! I do think in some cases there are some better
  songs to show off these great singers voices.</Text>
  <Text category="music">If you want to learn about Texas music
  just buy this disc. Tom's love of life and artist's eye infect
  every song. The opening number "Tonight We Ride" is hard to beat.
  He sang it on David Letterman's show (Paul Shaffer played the
  accordian!). Letterman described it as a "song that will make you
  want to saddle up a horse, ride up to Connecticut and rob a
  liquor store." Me, I just went out and bought some good Reposado
  Gold. Letterman's got a point, though- the songs on this disc
  will move you one way or the other. My other favorites are
  Bucking Horse Moon, and All This Way for a Short Ride. Tom
  Russell is true American artist like Woody Guthrie or Pete
  Seeger, and this is one of his best.</Text>

  <Text category="music">Fluke's latest album had been long in
  coming, and plagued with issues (word on the grapevine is one of
  the trend-setting trio left some point during production). Still,
  years after their masterpiece Risotto, Fluke has returned intact
  and delivered another album, the oddly titled Puppy. Puppy is for
  the most part a dark album. It's clearly the evolution of the
  track Absurd (off Risotto) and its particular taste of big beat
  techno, with numerous tracks featuring similarly styled lyrics
  and vocals. The sound has been expanded with touches of
  industrial guitars and beats that would sound right at home in
  Prodigy's Fat Of The Land or at a Nine Inch Nails concert. The
  opening Snapshot shows this most evidently. The album takes up a
  rave feel with the tracks Another Kind Of Blues (a remix of the
  stellar number Zion featured in The Matrix Reloaded and its
  soundtrack) and Hang Tough, which flow into each other and result
  in a mesh of old-school rave beats with new-school industrial
  grooves. YKK is a wicked track that would easily be at home in a
  big-budget spy or action flick, while Expo is a sweeping and epic
  song. Blue Sky is as close to an uplifting number you'll find on
  the CD, with a full choir used in the song's chorus. Compared to
  Risotto, Puppy inevitably comes up short. Like BT's Emotional
  Technology, Puppy has the misfortune of being the follow-up album
  to a complete and utter masterpiece (Puppy to Risotto, Emotional
  Technology to Movement In Still Life). And let's face it: it's
  hard to surpass yourself when release an album that's
  nigh-perfect. Still, I wasn't sure what to expect with Puppy and
  I found myself pleasantly surprised. It's darker and meaner, but
  it's an overall rock-solid album, and fans of the grittier side
  of Fluke (Absurd, Atom Bomb) will likely be pleased with
  Puppy</Text>
  <Text category="music">I recently decided to go through some of
  my old cds that I haven't listened toin ages. Dj Cheb i Sabbah's
  Maha Maya: Shri Durga Remixed&amp;amp;quot; was one of those cds
  that I came upon. This was my first exposure to Indian music, let
  alone world music. I wasn't really familiar with music outside of
  western culture. So this was a new experience for me. Listening
  to &amp;amp;quot;Maha Maya&amp;amp;quot; Shri Durga
  Remixed&amp;amp;quot; certainly takes the listener on a trip to
  India with its traditional Indian melodies. I envisioned myself
  in the Taj Mahal and watching a slew of belly dancers performing.
  The music took me awhile for the melodies to grow on me. It is
  certainly by no means your traditional dance remix album. I
  however dug Transglobal Underground's version of
  &amp;amp;quot;Kese Kese&amp;amp;quot; (Where's the Sarangi
  Mix&amp;amp;quot; right from the get go. It has a nice beat. Dj
  Cheb i Sabbah did a good job at mixing and making sure that the
  music flowed well together. I am definitely curious to hear dj
  Cheb's other cds now that I have re-discovered this little gem of
  a cd</Text>

  <Text category="music">This mix starts off heavy, and never lets
  up, with the quirky, yet hard hitting vocal track Grace (Anxiety)
  by Troy Pierce (as Louderbach) starting things off in a very
  energetic way. This track worked well in Sascha Funke's Boogy
  Bytes 2 mix, but it was deep into the mix. I feel it's even more
  effective starting a mix off. Things quickly lighten up with the
  bloopy Claude VonStroke next, and then it's into the M.A.N.D.Y.
  remix of Tiefschwarz's excellent track Damage, featuring Tracey
  Thorn of Everything But The Girl on vocals. Two solid tech house
  tracks follow, especially Touane's snappy track Bassic, and it's
  right into the gritty, churning, techno sound of Thomas
  Schumacher's incredible track Rotor. The mix then hits a very
  slight snag in track 7, which I feel is one of only two so-so
  parts of the mix. It's not bad, it's just a little too light and
  bubbly tech house for my liking. It's quickly forgotten as the
  mix races through with 4 solid tracks in a row, and right after
  the melodic Freefall, it's into Tiefschwarz's own remix of a
  Depeche Mode track. This is the only other slight miss in the mix
  for me, as I feel the track was a tad too long at nearly 7
  minutes, and could have been trimmed to better fit the flow of
  the mix. Another solid melodic track is next, and we end with the
  dubbed out vocals of Kate Wax. Overall, it's an exciting tech
  house mix that's a full lineup of solid tracks, with not a bad
  one in sight, and very few dips in the scorching pace of one,
  very sound, top to bottom mix. Do not miss picking this one up,
  as it's easily in the top 5 techno/tech house mixes this
  year</Text>

  <Text category="music">As much as I hear time and again that
  "Mindcrime" was the Seattle quintet's finest, I always have to
  argue that this 1986 gem is the pinnacle of their career. While I
  was a big fan of Mindcrime and it's predecessor "The Warning",
  Rage For Order is QR's most consistent release and is mezmerising
  from start to finish. In a word.."perfect". So few bands can
  boast having made a perfect album. I can think only of The
  Beatles (Sgt. Pepper &amp;amp; Revolver to name a few), Pink
  Floyd (The Wall, Dark Side), Dream Theater (Images &amp;amp;
  Awake), and Boston (Debut). Rage is an album to be listened to
  and appreciated. Released in the hey-day of "hair metal", this
  album has not one single song that lends itself to the tag. None
  of the songs, while very image provoking, could be easily made
  into an MTV hit. Although "Gonna Get Close To You" aired on MTV
  (rarely I might add) it didn't even scratch the surface of this
  album's potential. Overall, the performances of each member
  outshine anything before, or since. DeGarmo and Wilton trade
  licks masterfully. Rockenfield and Jackson keep a very tight
  bottom end. Tate...well...Tate was THE metal singer at that time
  and this was his finest performance. While the mix was somewhat
  lacking, the production was incredible. Each song blends into
  each other perfectly. This was metal that was unique and
  completely original. I think the term "thinking man's metal" was
  coined at the time. That said, I can think of no other release at
  the time to which that term could be applied. Unlike most of
  their metal contemporaries at the time, Rage was athmospheric,
  intellectual, and surreal. Rage succeeded where Priest's "Turbo"
  failed abysmally. It was a stark vision of the future and the
  metal was more futuristic than we'd ever heard before. It was
  like listening to a whole new machine. It still holds it's own 20
  year later, seeming as fresh and "now" as anything in progressive
  metal.</Text>

  speechless. Not since our belated introductions to Moondog...Skip
  Bifferty...Billy Nicholls...Stones' "Metamorphosis"...Dantalian's
  Vehicule... It can easily be yours. We very rarely care to replay
  any c.d. over and over but this one warrants such: well-crafted
  blend of nonchalance poetry and passion, delicacy and yarbles,
  hooks and chops and pacing and SONGS up there with the legends.
  The news that this cohesive album was only DEMO'S* ('haps
  fortuitous in retrovision) catapults one's estimation higher
  still. Singer Reg King: on ROLLED'S strength his visage deserves
  a spot on some Rushmore-in-Avalon alongside fellow soulful Brits
  Winwood/ Marriott/ Reid/ Lloyd/ Stewart...: just hoarse
  enough/just sweet enough (+ a 'secret': optimal use throughout of
  unison doubletracking)...perfection. ROLLED GOLD'S production is
  on the raw/monoish/hotly-compressed side-- a flute/piano
  occasionally to augment the basic guitar quartet formula
  &amp;amp; keep things unexpected-- suiting the songs &amp;amp;
  performances to a Tee (just to offer another clue to their magic
  brew). Homey's in no way related to any bandmember..</Text>
  <Text category="music">I'm not sure what took me so long to get
  it, but I'm just coming across this album. It never made a blip
  on my radar I guess. Anyway, I saw it at a local record store in
  the used bin for $2.00 and it was hardly used -- even the jewel
  case was flawless (it looked like it was only played once and
  then taken back to the store). Obviously the owner before me
  didn't know what they had on their hands and the store manager
  didn't know either due to it's low price tag. Balance is a must
  have album without question. It came out in '03, I'm just getting
  it here in late '05 and it still sounds fresh. There are so many
  bangers on this album that listing them would make this a five
  paragraph review. Of the 16 joints (including the bonus track),
  I'd have to say that 14 of them are amazing. Akrobatik rhymes
  with an honesty and realism that is rarely heard in rap (even
  amongst underground emcees). The songs compliment and play off of
  each other without them all sounding the same. I did mention that
  there were two songs that I could've done without. Those songs
  are "Hand That Rocks The Cradle" and "Always Bet On Ak". They
  aren't bad, but I find myself skipping them everytime I play this
  CD. Balance is a must have LP. I still feel a bit cheated since I
  just found out about this album. There has to be some sort of
  promotion for this guy. I did get the Black Dialogue
  (Perceptionists) album and I knew about The Lost Adats and The
  EP, but somehow I completely missed this one. Don't be like me,
  if you haven't heard this yet, grab it as soon as you can. You
  won't regret it. This is one of the best albums on 2003. Highly
  reccomended. Standout Tracks: Time, Woman II, Remind My Soul,
  Balance, Hypocrite, Limelight, Front Days, Here &amp;amp; Now,
  Wreck Dem feat. Mr. Lif, Cooler Heads, Feedback feat. Diamond D,
  and Bone Crushe</Text>
  <Text category="music">A great series concept - highly
  significant artists performing material which taken individually
  or collectively represents a major section of the American Music
  Library. Ofcourse the originally withdrawn [w. new at-the-time
  Funky people] &amp;amp;quot;Talkin' Loud..&amp;amp;quot; by JB (I
  bought it retail! ) is the highlight, along with the live
  &amp;amp;quot;It's My Thing...&amp;amp;quot; by Marva Whitney.
  (Yes, I saw MW sing it **l-i-v-e** at Madison Square Garden in
  July, 1969). The prev. unrel. Bobby Byrd track and Vicki
  Anderson's contribution to the &amp;amp;quot;Cold
  Sweat&amp;amp;quot; session also reinforce the value for
  listeners</Text>
  <Text category="music">In 1976, MY FAIR LADY returned to
  Broadway, in a revival touted as the "20th Anniversary"
  production. Perhaps most famously, this particular revival was
  the first big professional splash of a young soprano called
  Christine Andreas... At long last, this much sought-after cast
  album gets its CD premiere. Christine Andreas is one of the best
  Eliza's ever captured on disc, and Ian Richardson's performance
  as beleaguered tutor Higgins is full of wit and humour. George
  Rose (in a Tony-winning turn as Eliza's dustman father) is very
  enjoyable in his main numbers "With a Little Bit of Luck" and
  "Get Me to the Church on Time". Jerry Lanning also makes for a
  fine Freddy, with the winsome "On the Street Where You Live".
  This recording also features the "Embassy Waltz" sequence, which
  was never included on the OBC, and only featured as a bonus track
  on the reissue of the OLC. The production itself heavily
  recreated the original production, complete with Oliver Smith's
  sets and Cecil Beaton's costumes. Hanya Holm's choreography was
  revived thanks to original dance captain Crandall Diehl.
  Christine Andreas picked up a Theatre World Award for her
  breakthrough performance. The show opened at the St. James
  Theatre on March 25th 1976, but later moved to the Lunt-Fontanne
  Theatre where it closed the following year after 377
  performances. The following year, Andreas returned to Broadway in
  another important revival, the 1978 production of "Oklahoma!" in
  which she made a thrilling Laurey (cast album available on RCA);
  before cememting her position as Broadway's ingenue of choice,
  with the role of Frankie Frayne in the 1983 revival of "On Your
  Toes" (cast album available on Jay/TER). More recently, she
  played Marguerite St. Just, in the original company of Frank
  Wildhorn's flawed "Scarlet Pimpernel" (cast album available on
  Atlantic). I heartily recommend this particular MY FAIR
  LADY</Text>

  <Text category="music">I discovered this album some years ago as
  i'm workin' in big music stores i've got the opportunity to
  listen to so much music....well!! this album is a very difficoult
  one to find in a record store nowdays, and every time i have it
  in stock i play it straight away and some customer who listen to
  it buy it instantly,Blakey and Potato are swingin' so much in
  those &amp;amp;quot;salsa like&amp;amp;quot; rithms Mobley is -as

  wonderfull touch to evry note he plays,basically one of greatest
  Blue Note of all time!</Text>
  <Text category="music">This is by far one of the most beautiful
  recordings made by the Bill Evans trio. This was I'm told Bill's
  first all ballads record. Riverside records released it on vinyl
  way back in 1962. None of the music sounds dated. considering
  it's 41 years old. This is the first recording Bill made with
  Chuck Israels taking over for the late Scott Lafaro as the bass
  player. This album has a very haunting and romantic feeling to
  it. The music is sad in tone and suggests feelings of longing and
  sobering reflection. One goal that Bill always strived for was to
  ballance intellect with passion to make intelligent and original
  sounding jazz. I dont even know if jazz is the right stamp to put
  on this recording. To me it sounds more like European classical
  music. Also thank god for Bill's college music theory teacher at
  Southeastern University Gretchen Magee. Because if it werent for
  her motivation {Evans often thought of his work as unsatisfactory
  and sometimes needed alot of motivation from from bandmates and
  peers} he might not have composed his gorgeous original
  composition "Very Early" {which is the last track on the CD its
  just breathtaking...}Being an amature pianist myself, "Very
  early" and "childrens play song" were the first two Evans'
  compositions I taught myself to play. The piece is a composition
  played in C major at a slow waltz tempo. He played the tune until
  the end of his life in 1980, but the original version on
  "moonbeams" might be the all around finest one. It is given a
  very slow and delicate treatment, and when he restates the theme
  at the end you can almost feel an imagrey of leaves or snow
  falling gently around you. I also really like his interpretation
  of "It might as well be spring". I think that Bill Evans was a
  beautiful person and pianist because he was never flashy and this
  album proves that. He didnt play anything he didnt have to. He
  always played just the right amount of notes and chords. With
  this record it all comes together coherently to make a truly
  stunning musical statement. Evans once told Tony Bennet to forget
  everything else and just concentrate on "truth and beauty." With
  the album "moonbeams" fans of Evans' music and important legacy
  will clearly be able to hear his own truth and beauty about life
  glowing from this gorgeous album. Highly recommended</Text>

  <Text category="music">Leo Kottke is a national treasure. He is
  our greatest living solo acoustic guitar virtuoso. Having said
  that, you'd expect his CDs to be at a very high level of
  brilliance. I have at least a dozen of his titles. If there is
  any trouble in deciding the merits of any one disc, it's because
  there are so many Kottke releases to choose from. "One Guitar, No
  Vocals" clearly ranks as one of the best. The compositions tickle
  my brain, warm my heart, and put a bounce into my step. The
  guitar playing is dazzling. You really get a glimpse of the man
  behind the guitar by listening to this music - brilliant,
  thoughtful, odd, complex, quirky, a huge heart, and the wackiest
  sense of humor. It's spirited music, so thoroughly drenched in
  the personality of its creator that it's unmistakably and
  immediately recognizable as Leo. The world is full of acoustic
  guitar instrumentalists these days. Some of them are quite
  excellent. Many are not. But there is only one Leo Kottke. And
  his guitar music is a gift to the world. A very strong
  recommendation for this CD</Text>
  <Text category="music">I saw her perform most of these songs on
  Austin City Limits. I must admit I hadn't paid much attention to
  her since her debut album, back when I was playing in country
  bands. Much of this material is kinda introspective, but hey, on
  the plus side you get great vocals, well crafted songs, tons of
  sincerity and just flat out integrity from this great artist who
  doesn't have to pretend she is anything she isn't. And these
  days, that is pretty refreshing! I think I am becoming a
  fan</Text>
  <Text category="music">And finding stories of stacks of old
  vinyls, dripping Yesterday and glowing Always. Cali's finest,
  Madlib, is definitely one of the heirs of DJ Premiere, Pete Rock,
  DJ Quik and other previous beat konductas that helped established
  the sound of true hip-hop as a platform where old school soul and
  new school technique are amalgamated. The latest Madlib Invasion
  is not for everybody; those of us who's butts were undeniably
  moved by Tribe's "Low End Theory" will definitely appreciate this
  endeavor. Those of you who are tired of what MTV and other
  corporate entities and pass off as hip hop, clean out your crazy
  Uncle Otis's attic check out the Beat Konducta. Then walk down
  the street to Mr. Yancey's house, go into his basement and check
  out J Dilla's "Donuts.</Text>
  <Text category="music">It's a testament to the noncomformity of
  the era that XTC's quirky debut album had the band initially
  lumped in with the late 70's first wave of British punk rock.
  Those were different times, after all. You couldn't find a teen
  punk these days who could make head nor tails out of the
  herky-jerky, spastic wit of &amp;amp;quot;White
  Music&amp;amp;quot;. Come to think of it, not many people could
  make much sense of it back then, either. Andy Partridge's elastic
  vocals refused to clearly enunciate any words with more syllables
  than &amp;amp;quot;pop&amp;amp;quot;, and Barry Andrews'
  keyboards were more an attempt to interrupt rather than
  complement each song. Nevertheless, the album worked. It rocked
  in its own art-damaged way, and fearlessly toyed with the sacred
  relics of the previous generation. That lone strum of a single
  chord at the beginning of the Fab Four's &amp;amp;quot;Hard Day's
  Night&amp;amp;quot; was cleverly appropriated for the intro to
  &amp;amp;quot;This Is Pop&amp;amp;quot;. A few songs later
  Dylan's &amp;amp;quot;All Along the Watchtower&amp;amp;quot; got
  twisted into ominous goofball paranoia. There may have been more
  intense punk artifacts from the Class of '78, but not many were
  anywhere near as smart as &amp;amp;quot;White

  <Text category="music">Jeff Beck is the best guitarist on the
  planet and has been for a very long time. What you get here is an
  abbreviated version of him live. His song selection is not the
  best, but Freeway Jam which is one of my all time favorite Beck
  songs is included. You also ger Scatterbrain and Blue Wind. She's
  a Woman the old Beatles song is also included. Jeff Beck at this
  time was playing some of his best guitar and his solo
  instrumental career was taking off. The songs with the Jan Hammer
  Group to me are very average and infact distract what Beck is
  trying to to. Unfortunately this is his only Live album from his
  instrumental era. I truely wish he would release a DVD of himself
  in concert for those who either havent seen him live or would
  like to see him live on DVD. The idea was good, the Cd is too
  short and not up to snuff</Text>
  <Text category="music">This is one of his best cd's. You really
  have to listen to the words on the cd, he takes you to whole
  another level. He is one of the best r&amp;amp;b singers ever,

  that special place for you and your lady</Text>

  <Text category="music">I have listened to this wonderful
  soundtrack and I think it is superb!! I now know that the ALIEN
  movies rock! The tone of the music fits the movie. I especially
  like &amp;amp;quot; Ripleys Them&amp;amp;quot; Because it
  reflects on what has happened with Ripley through-out the movie.
  The cloning, learing, remebering and also meeting her clones. I
  would also like to say that the movie was excellent aswell. The
  cast did a great job, acting their hearts out. Jean-Pierre Jeunet
  should be proud of the music and his film.So if you aren't an

  <Text category="music">Hard, smart, creative funk can be a hard
  pursuit in life these days. Even with the age of the reissue
  firmly upon us, finding a decently accessible funk album can be a
  real biyatch. Thankfully, "Secrets," under the usually readily
  available Columbia jazz header is probably just sitting there in
  your jazz section pleading with you to pick it up for $9.99.
  Should this be a hard decision? Emphatically: No. Although I can
  see where previous reviewers are coming from, trying to compare
  this outing to Headhunters is truly unnecessary. With this '76
  effort Herbs is definitely toeing the fine line between jazz,
  funk and disco but it all works. "Doin It" is a super, super
  heavy funk jam and sounds like it was culled from the "Man-Child"
  sessions. And although "Gentle Thoughts" can be interpreted as a
  dated sound it probably stands as my favorite rip on the album.
  It's got a great walking bassline and super funky breakdown and,
  as always, Herbie dancing on the keys. Go get "Secrets," don't
  think about it. It'll always be an easy go-to funk bomb just when
  you need a little infusion</Text>
  <Text category="music">For hard-driving well-crafted
  rock-and-roll from the late 70s/early 80s, you can't do much
  better than Pat Benatar (and Heart) and this collection carries
  most -- but not all -- of the singles that dominated the airwaves
  for 4 years: Heart Breaker, Hit me With Your Best Shot, Love is a
  Battlefield, Fire and Ice, Promises in the Dark. But no Benatar
  collection is complete without 'Treat Me Right', 'You Better
  Run', and 'I Want a Lover who won't drive me crazy' (superior, in
  my opinion, to the John Mellencamp version), especially if you
  prefer Benatar's hard-driving rockers to her slower ballads.
  Nevertheless, 'Best Shots' is a great place to start and
  certainly - at $10-15 versus $50 for the more complete 'All Fired
  Up' -- the best value for the money.</Text>

  <Text category="music">Throb was my introduction to jazz back in
  '69 or '70. I have listened to it all of these years on LP then
  CD, and it never lost its charm. Steve Swallow was just as nutty
  then as he is now, "Chickens" is my favorite cut. The play
  between electric violinist Richard Greene and guitarist Jerry
  Hahn is a thing of beauty. Hahn is still a player who can put
  just the right note in just the right place (like that other
  countrified genius of jazz Bill Frisell), he can fuzz and wah-wah
  then tinkle the strings just right to make his musical point. One
  interesting thing is the organ playing by Burton on Throb,
  besides his vibes. The Jarrett-Burton album also has Hahn and
  Swallow, and drummer Bill Goodwin --It is very much an album that
  shows all the new ideas sprouting in music. Fortunately, the
  ideas of that time did not die out, but have continued to grow,
  making room for all sorts of fusions in Jazz, many of which have
  been remarkable to experience. These two-LPs-in-one is like
  having a Superstar album before they became superstars. As I said
  before, I still play this CD after almost 35 years, and I still
  get a kick out of it, and still find things that amaze me</Text>
  <Text category="music">Which I suppose I'm not allowed to say,
  what with the worldwide phenomenon that was Songs From the Big
  Chair. But I think it's right. Roland took the opportunity
  following the breakup with Curt to make an aggressively
  postmodern record, and return to the steely-eyed austerity that
  the lyrics on The Hurting always suggested. Indeed, this album is
  continually proving to be ahead of its time; as a previous
  reviewer noted, "Goodnight Song" has what has since become a
  familiar AOR sound. I call it the first "Coldplay" song, and it's
  fair to suggest that band would never exist without Tears For
  Fears. Roland also finally nails the pacing of an album here. On
  Songs and Seeds, 8 tracks was not enough to allow for a full
  dynamic arc, a sense of opening, progression, and completion; the
  10 songs here have room to breathe, vary significantly between
  each other and finally close satisfyingly with "Goodnight". As
  both Roland and Curt have matured, they have also mellowed. The
  anger they felt at the world and towards each other seems to be
  gone. And their latest album, Everybody Loves a Happy Ending, has
  none of the dge that made their older stuff so energizing. But
  CDs don't age, so pick this sucker up. It really doesn't get much
  better</Text>

  <Text category="music">The Animals, a group that included Eric
  Burdon and Alan Price, were the first major pop stars to emerge
  from Newcastle, a city located about 300 miles north of London,
  therefore far removed from where most talent scouts were
  searching. It is fortunate for us all that the Animals were
  discovered because they recorded some of the best R+B music to
  come of the UK in the sixties. Their biggest hit was House of the
  rising sun, a re-working of a folk song (apparently inspired by
  Josh White's version of the song) that gave them a transatlantic
  number one hit. They had five other top ten UK hits with Mickie
  Most, these being I'm crying, Don't let me be misunderstood (a
  cover of a Nina Simone song), Bring it on home to me (a Sam Cooke
  cover), We gotta get out of this place (the version included here
  is the UK version - a markedly different recording was released
  in America but was unavailable for inclusion in this set) and
  It's my life. Apart from their singles, the Animals recorded many
  other covers including Boom boom, Dimples, I'm mad again (all
  John Lee Hooker), Around and around, Memphis Tennessee, How
  you've changed (all Chuck Berry), I'm in love again, I've been
  around (both Fats Domino), Talking about you, Hallelujah I love
  her so and I believe to my soul (all Ray Charles). These covers
  clearly demonstrate what their main influences were, but they
  also wrote some of their own songs. All the music I've mentioned
  so far and much more can be found on this excellent compilation.
  Nevertheless, despite the title of the compilation, it isn't
  actually their complete recordings - there is a sub-text
  explaining that these are the complete recordings that they made
  with Mickie Most as producer, although the liner notes describe
  their whole career. After the split, they switched to another
  record label, where they had some success using the name Eric
  Burdon and the Animals, including two more UK top ten hits (Don't
  bring me down, San Franciscan nights) and several lesser hits,
  all of which can be found elsewhere (search for Eric Burdon).
  Alan Price left the group before the split with Mickie Most and
  had several hits as a solo singer. These are also outside the
  scope of this collection but are easy to find. This complete
  collection (apart from the American version of We've got to get
  out of this place) of the first and most important part of the
  Animals' career may be more than some people want - there are
  single CD collections available if you just want the hits - but
  if, like me, you like to explore beyond the hits, this is for
  you</Text>
  <Text category="music">When this first was released I really
  wasn't expecting much. The last two releases Mega-Dave put out
  Risk, and the World Needs a Hero excluding the live Rude
  Awakening while certainly had some moments were 3 out of 5
  material, but in defense they had to do what they to do to stay
  around. However, this album from the up tempo Blackmail the
  Universe, Kick the Chair which could have been on Rust In Peace,
  the Scorpion another return to form, and Back in the Day
  definitely were a few of the many highlights of this album. I
  wouldn't put this up there with Rust In Peace or Countdown, but I
  certainly would put this up there with So Far So Good or
  Youthansia actually this album kind of takes elements from those
  albums, and put's it into one. If your a new fan and just getting
  into Megadeth this isn't a bad place to start. Certainly a must
  have, and am looking forward to the brand new album next year.

  <Text category="music">Other than that this is a proper
  introduction to the Heavster</Text>
  <Text category="music">Quite different from his later big-band
  recordings. Some of the songs that you may find on Wes' 'BEST OF'
  collections sound too much like elevator music. Not so with this
  debut album. A drummer, a organist, and a guitar player; no horn
  section. Stripped down in the sence of band size but very deep
  and articulate playing. He shows of his trade mark octave
  playing, his chord solos (played over the organs rythm chords
  none the less), and flashy runs across the fret board when
  needed. A good CD to start with for the guitarist who wants to
  play jazz.</Text>

  solid tack lis</Text>
  <Text category="music">Five stars may be excessive if you judge
  this CD alongside the greatest classics, but when compared to
  similar CDs within the singer-songwriter folk-rock genre, this
  beautifully simple and powerful collection really shines. I find
  myself coming back to this CD more often than to many
  better-known classics because it has a freshness and originality
  that sustain interest. The writing, while occasionally a bit
  awkward, is consistently interesting, honest and moving. The
  themes of introspection, nostalgia, regret, and defiance are
  presented in a searingly personal manner. The song "If I Were a
  Man" is a rich celeration of the wonders women bring to
  relationships and the world; "Child of Steel" plucks the
  heartstrings with an achingly wistful delicacy; and "Take my
  Body" is a strong lament about the objectification of women. I
  especially love the pared-down guitar arrangements; the
  simplicity really works with Ms. Cash's strong vocals and makes
  me wish some of my other favorite vocalists would occasionally
  just get back to basic guitar accompaniments. I've seen Ms. Cash
  perform live and, while she has other hits that may be more
  popular, this collection reveals her unique brilliance</Text>
  <Text category="music">Even though Mitchell wanted to feel
  reckless in this album, she accomplished one thing with her
  music: coming closer to Weather Report. It's obvious she loved
  its jazz-fusion and admired Jaco Pastorious and Wayne Shorter so
  much to have invited them to reach their peaks, but as master
  musicians they could only achieved what Joni allowed them to do.
  In "Paprika Plains" (a song over 16 min. long) Joni unloads
  wonderful lyrics but only allows her group of pioneers to explode
  at the last two and half minutes. I would have hoped to hear a
  longer and more robust instrumental finish worthy of Weather
  Report's reputation. Over all the album is interesting because
  Mitchell is not afraid of going out on a very tiny
  limb....</Text>
  <Text category="music">The Soundtrack is great but some of the
  good songs from the movie arent on it. Overall it is a good
  produc</Text>
  <Text category="music">Yeah, Johnny must've been drinking heavily
  during this recording. It's evident in his slurred lyrics...It's
  Raining is the song where he sounds totally wasted, although you
  can get the sense that he is infact quite happy and very relaxed.
  BUT all this inebriation actually adds to the authenticity of
  this c.d.---- Johnny Winter really becomes the archetypal
  BLUESMAN on this c.d. His guitar work is quite sparse, no long
  solos on this one but, nevertheless, the feel on this album is
  wonderful. I have to say this also..Johnny must've been VERY,
  VERY brave to release this album back in 1977. That was a very
  bad year for the blues, appalling infact...disco music was king.
  Alot of bluesmen, like Johnny Guitar Watson etc were opting for
  the commercialism of the disco dance floor. Johnny might've
  thought of releasing a commercial type rock album , like Edgar
  was doing. Instead he chose to stay faithful to the blues and I
  have to admire the determination and resolve of Johnny Winter.
  Very few would've stayed faithful to the blues. The last track
  with Muddy Waters ..Walking Thru The Park...captures Johnny in
  his element. He was SO happy back then and it filters over into
  the song itself. I remember seeing them both do this song live at
  the Capitol Radio Festival, Alexander Palace, London/England in
  July 1977. Never again to be repeated, sadly</Text>
  <Text category="music">I really like this cd a lot and I am
  looking forward to seeing them live</Text>
  <Text category="music">I prefer the live versions of these
  pieces. Its nice to get more material from that period but you
  can hear the strain that was going on at the time of this final
  album by this line-up. I was at the concert for live record and
  think that they (the pieces that are on this CD) really come
  alive when being performed live</Text>
  <Text category="music">OK (I imagine there's still drool over my
  &amp;amp;quot;earlier&amp;amp;quot; review...and my wife is none
  too pleased either...) TRUTH OR DARE time! I bought this CD out
  of none-too-scientifical curiousity, that, and &amp;amp;quot;Let
  Me Blow Ya Mind&amp;amp;quot; - and guess what? I'm beginnin' to
  dig the entire CD. As I mentioned, 99 &amp;amp;amp; 44/100th% of
  &amp;amp;quot;rap music&amp;amp;quot; fully explains to me what
  Gregg Allman meant when he sang, &amp;amp;quot;It's not my cross
  to bear.&amp;amp;quot; OK, that being said, Eve pulls no punches
  (although the &amp;amp;quot;skits&amp;amp;quot; on the thing
  about wet myself laughing), and she's not a lady whom'd I'd like
  to cross. But &amp;amp;quot;I bought the ticket, so I'm gonna
  take th' ride.&amp;amp;quot; And enjoy myself mightily while
  doing so..</Text>
  <Text category="music">A friend of mine at work just recently
  introduced me to the music of Chris Rea via this very nice Best
  Of comp. He also recommended getting his Road To Hell cd. Both of
  these cd's were money well spent. I'm surprised that this artist
  flew by my radar screen in the 80's when he was at the peak of
  his songwriting and popularity, mainly due to his top 20 hit
  "Fool (If You Think It's Over)". For some reason I never equated
  that song with this artist. The thing I like most about Rea is
  his musical diversity. He can lay down a very memorable AM pop
  hit like "Fool" or "Let's Dance" and then turn around and make a
  great blues rock album like "Road To Hell". No matter what the
  genre of music, this artist is very good at laying down a nice
  groove. There's plenty of catchy tunes to be found throughout
  this cd. "Auberge" and especially the wonderful "On The Beach"
  stuck out for me. But you get many styles here. And each song
  sets a different mood. From the easy listening "Winter Song" or
  the catchy "Looking For Summer". Or some excellent blues rock
  like "Road To Hell", "God's Great Banana Skin" or the excellent
  instrumental hidden track at the end of the cd that shows off
  Rea's tasty slide guitar skills. I don't know how I missed this
  artist after all of these years. But I'm a new Rea fan who now
  looks forward to his next album. Whatever style that it might be,
  I'm betting it will have some versatile playing and some very
  well composed melodies like this superb Best Of. This is a nice
  place to start listening to this fine artist. If your like me,
  after hearing this cd you'll probably want to search out some of
  his individual albums. I've since picked up his late 80's album
  "Dancing With Strangers". Another very nice cd. Most of the music
  on this Best Of cd is almost 20 years old, but it feels like it
  could have been written today. In other words it's well composed
  music that holds up very well over time. And I'm sure if your
  like me and not familiar with Rea's music, the minute you hear
  "Fool" or "On The Beach" it's going to bring the good part of the
  80's back to you. Greatest hits cd's should all be this good.
  Highly recommended</Text>
  <Text category="music">This record is a must from the middle of
  the 50's . Excellent singer , very good musicians and an
  excellent recording . This record is still amazing and seems to
  sound very modern due to the quality of the recording and the
  mastering. I recommend this record to all rock and roll
  fan</Text>
  <Text category="music">Ummm if you buy it you will know I
  borrowed it from a friend and he never got it back...so I bought
  him another</Text>
  <Text category="music">I pretty much agree with EJ Rupert, but
  the good songs on this soundtrack are so strong that they make
  this album damn near classic all by themselves. I gave this album
  4 stars for that very reason. Though it was never released as a
  single, "My Block" is one of Tupac's best songs (pre death row
  era is the best 'Pac in my opinion). I don't think there's any
  question that every rap music fanatic recognizes Red and Meth's
  "How High" as an unquestionable classic (and this is the grimy
  version of How High....not the fluffy remix). I still get open to
  that beat 11 years later. Though it is somewhat formulaic, "Poppa
  Luv It" is still a dope cut from LL Cool J. Bone Thugs N Harmony,
  Mary J. Blige, and Onyx contribute "Everyday Thang", "Everday It
  Rains", and "Live!!" which show each artist in vintage form in my
  humble opinion. Also, "Sowhatyousayin'" is the ideal west coast
  gangsta track in my mind. Even when you get past those great
  tracks, you have other bangers like "Kill Dem All" [Kali Ranks],
  "Glamour &amp;amp; Glitz" [A Tribe Called Quest], and "Still
  Can't Fade It" [Warren G.] that still make for a great listening
  experience. Hell, even The Dove Shack blew up on the strength of
  "Summertime In The LBC". And the live version of Biggie's "Me
  &amp;amp; My B*tch" is definitely different from the studio
  version and it's great. There's plenty to love about this album.
  I also agree that there are too many filler tracks. "What's Up
  Star", "Ol' Skool", "Domino's In The House" and "Zoom Zooms
  &amp;amp; Wam Wam" all fall under the filler category. Actually,
  the filler tracks are the only things wrong on this album and I'd
  say that only 10% of the album is filler. The rest is bangin'.
  The Show Soundtrack is definitely a worthwhile pick up for any
  hip hop fan. There are bangers on this album that make it a must
  own. If you were into hip hop around the time this came out, you
  remember when half of these songs were played for the first time.
  There are definitely some classic tracks on this album. I highly
  recommend it. Also, for those of you that want more artists
  represented, check out the "Rhyme &amp;amp; Reason" soundtrack
  (which is pretty much similar to this, but with better collabos).
  You'll find a lot of artists there too. Standout Tracks: Poppa
  Luv It, My Block, Live!!!, Kill Dem All, Summertime In The LBC,
  How High (My Favorite), Everyday Thang, Everyday It Rains, and Me
  &amp;amp; My B*tch [Live</Text>
  <Text category="music">This is an awesome EP Slayer owns all even
  when the production isn't that great. Kerry King and Jeff
  Hanneman shred fast as hell with their blazing fast riffs, Tom
  Araya's vocals are very hellish and gruesome and Dave Lombardo's
  drums are fast as well. This EP is Slayer at their prime and even
  if it's only four songs it's well worth the price. Below are my
  views on each song. Chemical Warfare 100000000000001/10, Yes it
  is that awesome, this is a legendary Slayer song and a fan
  favorite. If you're gonna buy this for one song this is it, the
  lyrics are great and I love the riffs in this track. Captor Of
  Sin 10/10, The opening of the song is great. The song is really
  good too. My second favorite on this EP as well. Haunting the
  Chapel 7/10, I didn't really care for this song much, it's good
  but not mind blowing. Aggressive Perfector 10/10, Slayer's first
  song ever, the opening sorta reminds me of Metallica's "Hit The
  Lights" but the song is very different though. A part of this
  song sonds like the guitars are making video game like noises.
  The vocals are also a little different from other releases but
  it's still awesome. Overall this EP was a great follow up to
  their debut. It also led to what the band would later become,
  thrash legends. A must have for fans and general metal fans
  alike. Highly reccomended</Text>
  <Text category="music">We bought this - on cassette - in
  Washington DC on our first day of honeymoon in September 1997.
  Having flown from Northern Ireland, it provided us with the
  perfect honeymoon soundtrack as we drove from Washington to
  Nashville, along the Skyline drive, down through South West
  Virginia, across Eastern Kentucky to Berea, and down to Smoky
  Mountains National Park in Tennessee. We are from an
  Ulster-Scots/Scotch-Irish background, and during those three
  weeks we fell in love with the land that our forebears had
  settled in so many centuries before, bringing thier fiddles and
  folk songs with them, creating what was the core of mountain
  old-time music and bluegrass. From the Carter Family right
  through, every song is a classic. You must buy this</Text>
  <Text category="music">This album is hard! E-40 always come sic
  wit it. If you don't got it, ya betta git it. It reminds me of
  his (my fav.)&amp;amp;quot;I a major way&amp;amp;quot; album.
  Sluppin' from intro till outro. He is the bay area's finnest.
  Please belave it</Text>
  <Text category="music">More like 3.5. So. Half of this album is
  excellent. The rest is filler. But, due to "Times Like These",
  "All My Life", Disenchanted Lullaby (the intro irritates me but
  it gets better), "Have It All" (kinda sappy but I love the
  intro), "Low" (have you SEEN the video?) and "Overdrive" (again,
  kinda sappy but there's something about it I love), the album is
  pretty enjoyable. It doesn't compare to the first three, but it
  has its moments. The riffs are slightly heavier, most songs are
  pretty upbeat. "Times Like These" is an instant classic with
  awesome lyrics, while "All My Life" rocks harder than pretty much
  all previous songs. Kinda sucks how the best songs are/were
  singles, but if they had released other songs, no-one would buy
  the album. Mind you, my friend loves "Burn Away", so listen to
  the previews and make your own mind up</Text>
  <Text category="music">I heard this music on the excellent P B S
  Documentary: &amp;amp;quot;Liberty - the American
  Revolution&amp;amp;quot; and I knew I had to have it! It is the
  finest music I have heard, capturing the heart and soul of the
  American Revolution. The documentary
  &amp;amp;quot;Liberty&amp;amp;quot; was a masterpiece that was
  beautiful and moving. So too this music with its most wonderful
  arrangements and accompaniment. I love it! I could hardly wait to
  get it in the mail. It framed the documentary (which I also
  bought) like a great frame compliments a beautiful canvas
  painting. Superlatives fail me. This music must be experienced by
  first watching the great series on the American Revolution and
  then by listening to it apart. This is some of the most wonderful
  music I have ever heard. It reminds me of the genius of Aaron
  Copland who wrote the Applachian Spring and Rodeo suites</Text>
  <Text category="music">This is a great CD. &amp;amp;quot;Back
  Where I Come From&amp;amp;quot;, is on of those feel good songs
  that gives me chill bumps every time I here it. Chesney is a
  extremely talented artist whose passion is shown in every song. I
  recommend all his albums</Text>
  <Text category="music">Very rich in music, fully orchestrated and
  full of energy. I highly recommend this album for everyone who
  loves New Age music and to all those who like Classical Music.
  David took it to another level on this one. I myself like New Age
  artists that incorporate Orchestra to their music and that is why
  I loved this album. If you like this album, I recommend you to
  explore Yanni, Secret Garden, Giovanni and Bernward Koch</Text>
  <Text category="music">The music here frequently reminded me of
  Pagan's Mind with a touch of Porcupine Tree and flashes of Iron
  Maiden. A fantastic mixture of 1970s Progressive rock bands such
  as Yes and Kansas molded with European-style Power Metal and
  Brazilian folk music. While this can be extremely interesting
  there are a few moments here and there that don't quite mesh. In
  actuality I give the CD 4.5 stars for its superb songcraft and
  inspired, sometimes flawed ambition. But as an overall package,
  this Special Edition of "Temple of Shadows" is an excellent place
  for newcomers as the bonus DVD holds a concert in 5.1 surround
  sound that is loaded with songs from their back catalog. This is
  a great album filled with high quality Progressive Power Metal
  and a DVD concert that gives a taste of their other albums (not
  to mention it's just plain fun to watch as the band members are
  clearly enjoying themselves, smiling throughout the show). Highly
  recommended.</Text>
  <Text category="music">Solas' previous CD &amp;amp;quot;Words
  That Remain&amp;amp;quot; is a classic in Irish traditional music
  and the loss of Karan Casey certainly affects their sound on this
  album. However, instrumentally they are incredibly strong and as
  inventive as ever and Deirdre Scanlon is a gifted singer with a
  wide range of styles. I don't think the choice of tracks is quite
  so strong but it is a powerful performance of a very high order
  of music. The instrumental playing at times leaves you breathless
  and the energy levels are very high. There are some lovely songs
  - i like &amp;amp;quot;Bonnie Mae&amp;amp;quot; and
  &amp;amp;quot;Miner's Life&amp;amp;quot; in particular and
  &amp;amp;quot;I Will Remember You&amp;amp;quot; is an original
  gem. I am disappointed to hear critics complain of the lack of
  &amp;amp;quot;traditional&amp;amp;quot; music on the CD and about
  the use of &amp;amp;quot;rock&amp;amp;quot; instruments. Based on
  those criteria the only instruments tolerated would be harp,
  uillean pipes, wooden flute and fiddle (tin whistle (flageolet),
  guitar, mandolin, bouzouki, accordion and banjo being modern,
  foreign invaders)and what a pity! What defines traditional - is
  it pre-Planxty? Can no more traditional songs be written? Seamus
  Egan and Co have done their apprenticeship in the rigorous
  disciplines from the book of traditional music (rhythm and
  melody) and have enriched it with a new chapter. In general i
  agree that bass and percussion is often unnecessary but in this
  case the augmentations are tasteful and generally effective. I
  would also highly revcommend Liz Carroll's &amp;amp;quot;Lost in
  the Loop&amp;amp;quot; although if you're a purist it has the
  Solas rhythm section playing on it and features many of Liz's
  &amp;amp;quot;brand new&amp;amp;quot; traditional tunes
  (brilliant)</Text>
  <Text category="music">First off, I'd like to say that I am not a
  Country music fan, but I am a Johnny Cash fan. He transcends the
  genre that turned his back on him in his later years, but here
  the man can do no wrong. Now, I bought the 2000 "expansion"
  release of this concert which at the time was dubbed the
  "complete concert recording". It was misleading because I had
  seen the British documentary (the DVD of this is included in the
  set)in which Johnny &amp;amp; friends were performing songs I
  never knew existed from this legendary event because they were
  absent on CD. Now this is the full sha-bang, complete with
  amazing packaging, the concert spread over two CDs, and the DVD
  mentioned above. If you bought the previous CD like I did, let me
  tell you, this is worth the upgrade as it seems this is the
  "definitive end to all release" of Johnny singing to the boys at
  San Quentin. For new fans, the single CD release might be the
  best place to start since it has at least 85% of what Johnny sang
  that night at San Quentin. The rest of the legacy tracks feature
  The Carter Family, Carl Perkins, and The Statler Bros. So if
  you're looking for a "Johnny Cash" solo concert, then get the
  single CD version. If you want the absolute complete version in a
  great package, 40 page booklet, and he Legendary British
  Documentary of this concert for the first time on DVD; The Legacy
  Edition of this memorable night is the way to go</Text>
  <Text category="music">Mountain Music offers what Alabama is
  famous for, great music and great harmony all packaged together.
  The title cut is great, that harmonica and &amp;amp;quot;old man
  of the mountain&amp;amp;quot; intro is unique. As for
  &amp;amp;quot;Close Enough to Perfect&amp;amp;quot; if any man
  sings that song to his lady, she is his forever. The cuteness of
  &amp;amp;quot;Never Be One&amp;amp;quot; also reminds us of the
  sadness that our children grow up so fast we hardly know it.
  There isn't a bad song on the whole CD and will make a good
  addition to any collection</Text>
  <Text category="music">Better balance of songs on this Cd. This
  Cd shows growth in a the band.They are great fun live check them
  out if you get the chance!!!!!!!</Text>
  <Text category="music">This is a wonderful view into what is the
  best and worst about a Tedeschi concert. She can be as soulful as
  the best of the blues singers but it also exposes her weakness:
  She just can't rock enough to provide the balance her act needs.
  She's terrific on the ballads but isn't a good enough guitar
  player to hold up the guitar playing for a band so they have to
  make do with her fabulous vocals. She's got solid keyboards and
  vocals in support, so it's not apparent until half way through
  the gig. But keyboards can't provide enough of an edge to the
  very few fast, upbeat songs and the whole concert lags. Zzzzz by
  2/3rds of the way through. Look at the audience at the end of the
  concert when she plays a lethargic version of "I Fell in Love."
  Very few people (besides the B3 player who has kept the only
  energy up through the show) are energized. Put this DVD on when
  you're in bed with a glass a red wine with your loved one and the
  fireplace is going and it'll be terrific, at least until you fall
  asleep</Text>
  <Text category="music">"The Passion of the Christ - Songs" is a
  fine collection of great songs, each in their own way a reaction
  to the spectacular film that Mel Gibson has created. The
  standouts are the song "I See Love" by Steven Curtis Chapman,
  Third Day an MercyMe; Scott Stapp's powerful solo debut song
  "Relearn Love;" "Rainy Day" by Big Dismal, and the emotional "New
  Again" by Brad Paisley and Sarah Evans. Despite a couple of songs
  that don't reach their true potential ("The Passion," and "How
  Many Lashes"), this is a fine CD that belongs in anyone's and
  everyone's Christian music collection. Grade: A-</Text>
  <Text category="music">if you are a fan of Oscar Peterson this
  belongs in your collection</Text>
  <Text category="music">If you are a fan of the Winter's Solstice

  <Text category="music">Sorry, ya just can't replace Michael
  Hutchence. This is a great overview of all of their greatest
  hits. I am not a huge fan of greatest hits CDs b/c people tend to
  buy them and, therefore, miss all of the excellent songs that
  weren't released as singles. All INXS CDs are worth buying
  separately. But, if you must.....this will work</Text>
  <Text category="music">Miss Saigon is my favorite all-time
  musical! I was hesitant when buying this recording because in my
  mind Lea Salonga is and always will be Kim! But I was pleasantly
  surprised. Joanna Ampil as Kim holds her own. While she doesn't
  have the vocal range of Lea, she has a beautiful, crisp voice
  which she uses to emote the emotional turmoil of Kim. She
  expresses herself in a way that makes you feel her love, pain and
  anguish and in turn she makes this part her own. The rest of the
  cast is superb (especially the amazing Ruthie Henshall as Ellen)
  but make no mistake, this show belongs to Ampil! I also fell in
  love with some of the material left out of the LCR. There a
  beautiful bridges and songs which enrich the story. "Back in
  Town" stands out for me because of the gorgeous melodies. Anyone
  who has fallen in love with the story of "Miss Saigon" will
  appreciate these added gems! This cast recording is definitely
  worth a listen!</Text>
  <Text category="music">In many ways, this album is everything one
  would have expected-- somehow the natural successor to "No
  Pussyfooting" and "Evening Star". In other ways, its nothing like
  I would have expected-- the usual stamps of Fripp and Eno's
  recent work seems to be missing. Its really quite hard to largely
  identify the identity of the musician generating the sound on
  much of this material, there's obvious stuff (we'll come to that
  in a minute), but as a rule, the backgrounds could be either of
  them. Sonically, it moves through a number of backdrops, with
  delicate, percussive, synthish loops dominating the early part of
  the record ("Meissa", "Lyra", "Tarazed"), wheras the middle of
  the record feels more like their old collaborations updated, the
  sort of modern Fripp soundscapes being more apparent ("Lupus",
  "Ankaa"). The remainder of the album features on track that is
  totally unexpected, the downright funky "Altair", with its train
  shuffling rhythms, drum loops, and funky guitar (in ways similar
  to material from the Eno/Schwaum "Drawn from Life" record), and
  the closer, "Terebellum", is an aggressive, haunting, and almost
  angry sounding piece almost reminiscent of "Radiophonics" or the
  other more aggressive soundscapes. Over this material, Fripp
  largely solos using a variant of his legendary fuzz tone-- its a
  bit mellower, and rounder though, similar to his leads on
  "Starless" and "The Power to Believe Part II" but in a more
  hushed feel. So that tells not much, the real question is, what's
  it like? Largely an ambient affair, the collaboration is what
  you'd expect-- there's no real incindiery moments here-- don't
  look for a "Baby's On Fire", but it is comparable to their
  previous collaborations in quality, and it certainly sounds
  nothing like Crimson. Some of it is full of delicate beauty
  ("Lyra"), some of its just a blast ("Altair"), some of its
  actually quite hard to listen to at all ("Terebellum"). For fans
  of ambient music, especially the work of these two gentelemen,
  this one will be quite rewarding. It falls short somehow of being
  a masterpiece, but it is really a great record.

  <Text category="music">Hands down, a 5 star, two thumbs up,
  classic joint. After it dropped, Puba reigned supreeeme.
  Disregard the Amazon reviewer, there are no "gaffes" in this one,
  period... These guys were true to their beliefs. They weren't
  packaging a product for "pop" consumption, they were telling a
  generation what THEY THOUGHT. Check it out and the music will
  speak for itself. The best track in my opinion was "Wake UP", but
  the whole album was great. As someone else mentioned, fast tracks

  that the first 5 Roxy Music albums were so flawlessly perfect
  that its hard to stand up against that level of
  perfection...anyway..with that said...I have NO IDEA why they
  took off the great rock version and put the disco-fluff version
  of Angel Eyes, which is hard to find on CD. This, to me is really
  the last Roxy Music Album, because you just CANT have Roxy Music
  without Paul Thompson...sorry. I mean Avalon and the others are
  nice pieces, but they really should have been Bryan Ferry solo
  albums because Andy and Phil are really playing more as session
  players there</Text>
  <Text category="music">I wonder if the two reviewers who said
  they were disappointed in this soundtrack watched the film? My
  guess is that they did not. The film was ENHANCED by the James
  Horner score and it would have been hurt by anything that was not
  light and subtle. It is a unique and amazing film and the score
  is a perfect match. By the way, the bigwigs at Universal nearly
  died when they heard it and then were equally stunned when they
  asked Horner for the written score and he had to admit that none
  existed! WONDERFUL MUSIC</Text>
  <Text category="music">What can I say about Vince Gill that his
  many fans haven't already mentioned. I had never been
  particularly interested in country music. But, one day I was
  listening to a country radio station and Vince Gill was singing
  &amp;amp;quot;When Ever You Come Around&amp;amp;quot; and I was
  hooked. This CD is as consistant as all his others. Great lyics
  and superb musicianship. I rate this five stars as I believe Gill
  is one of the best singer songwriters in the world today</Text>
  <Text category="music">Brilliant, glorious music--all of it,
  although I agree with those who have come to feel that the
  Ellington/Strayhorn version of &amp;amp;quot;The Nutcracker
  Suite,&amp;amp;quot; in particular, is an all-too-often-buried
  treasure that no Christmas season should be without (and if you
  can ignore it for the rest of the year, you have more willpower
  than I). What happens to Tchaikovsky's marvellous music--and
  Grieg's, too--in these hands is creative homage of the highest
  order: the music is re-imagined from the inside, in wholly jazz
  terms, in a way that simultaneously illuminates and completely
  reconceives the original. What Balanchine did for Tchaikovsky and
  Stravinsky in dance, Ellington here does for Tchaikovsky and
  Grieg in another realm of music, and leaves us with works that
  deserve to be every bit as loved and celebrated as their older
  and better-known prototypes. And to top it all off, you get
  Ellington and Strayhorn's own superb &amp;amp;quot;Suite
  Thursday.&amp;amp;quot; Listen and rejoice</Text>

  <Text category="music">This album has new meaning to me now in
  2007, where I go to a college next to a high school, where I see
  a bunch of "punk rockers" spending lots of money to make sure
  their hair is pretty and that their clothes are properly tattered
  to maximize trendiness. There are plenty of punk rock bands out
  there that keep the spirit of Social Distortion alive, but
  sometimes their music is hard to find, and all the posers you see
  start to slowly extinguish that old punk rock fire. Albums like
  this exist for times like those. Just stick it in, turn up the
  volume, and rock out</Text>
  <Text category="music">I felt compelled to write a review having
  read another written by someone who gave it one out of five
  stars. I felt it a grossly misleading and inaccurate review, so
  here I am... As a musician I could think of nothing more
  intimidating than attempting to cover a Buckley song. Their fan
  bases are fiercely loyal and protective of their material. So
  first things first I would like to congratulate the artists for
  their bravery. Furthermore a quick glance down the list of
  performers will quell any suspicions that this is 'just another
  tribute record cashing in on someone else's success', these are
  musicians that know what they're doing. What struck me the most
  was the variety of voices on this disc; you have the ethereal
  whisper of Sufjan Stevens, sweet folk harmonies of the Magic
  Numbers, the lazy drawl Micah P. Hinson. Not only that, but these
  are great interpretations from the Jeff &amp;amp; Tim cannon.
  Very inspired and innovative - a beautiful accordion riff on
  'Grace' , an Irish-jig inflected 'No Man Can Find The
  War'...these artists do not desire to replace Jeff or Tim,
  they're merely reuniting us with what they left us - their
  music.</Text>
  <Text category="music">Basie's best players come to Duke's place,
  the Columbia Records 30th Street Studios in 1961 and face
  Ellington's finest. Not a battle, but not quite a merger, either,
  since the Count's contingent is heard in one speaker and their
  hosts in another channel. There's more than an hour of good music
  on here, laid down in the dying days of big jazz touring
  orchestras. Popular tastes had changed and the costs of keeping
  large groups of players together were impossible. This is one of
  those rare CD's in which the booklet is almost as good as the
  music. This one reveals that during this 12-hour
  late-afternoon-to-early-morning session, one of Ellington's
  long-time employees quit the group forever because the boss would
  not take his side in a fight with a colleague. Also interesting
  is the dispute over the title and cover graphics. Basie hated
  Columbia's first idea to bill the date as a competition, and his
  agent even destroyed the only copy of the original cover art. The
  end result is an album whose sales over 40 years have been hurt
  because no one knows its name. The cover finally chosen says "The
  Count Meets the Duke" but in larger letters it declares "FIRST
  TIME!" and then adds "2 Great Orchestras" and finally states
  "Duke Ellington and Count Basie." The label Columbia/Sony put on
  the disc itself for this reissue says "Duke Ellington MEETS Count
  Basie" which makes no sense because they had known each other
  since the 20's. If you already like both orchestras, you'll want
  to own this late career session. If you want an introduction to
  each group in its waning years, the CD serves nicely for that,
  too. This disc really jives, so don't be expecting any ballads
  here</Text>
  <Text category="music">This arrived the other day, I pre ordered
  it. Two of the greatest songwriters ever in my opinion. Its about
  time this was available on CD and here it is. Sounds great! Go
  get it for the collection</Text>
  <Text category="music">I get the sense that The Fleetwoods'body
  of recorded work isn't given the respect it deserves. Over the
  course of their career, the trio recorded thirteen albums and yet
  this collection, as good as it is, is pretty much all that's out
  there on cd, save for a few other compilations that cover much of
  the same ground. Rock and roll has always had a soft side and
  it's in this area that the Fleetwoods really shine. Their cover
  of Thomas Wayne's &amp;amp;quot;Tragedy&amp;amp;quot; is an
  evocative slice of 1961 teen angst-I can't put it any other way.
  Maybe that's the reason why the Fleetwoods are given short shrift
  today: they're the perfect embodiment of a (then)nascent teen
  culture's soft and gentle side.This collection features all of
  their hits, some well chosen album tracks and the original
  pre-overdub version of &amp;amp;quot;Come softly to
  me&amp;amp;quot;. If you like this recording, try looking for
  their original lps. (My personal favourite is the 1963
  &amp;amp;quot;Goodnight my Love&amp;amp;quot; album.</Text>
  <Text category="music">If you're a Dion fan don't miss this CD.
  All the hits including my favourite - Donna the Prima
  Donna</Text>
  <Text category="music">I don't like this album as much as their
  earlier stuff. I have liked each release less than the previous,
  and this one falls right in line with that trend. The opener
  &amp;amp;quot;Quality Revenge . . .&amp;amp;quot; is one of their
  best songs hands down, though. This is a very good CD, but the
  farther from Braid we get in time the less I seem to like their
  music</Text>
  <Text category="music">My first Monk album was Monk's Dream from
  Columbia. I loved that album 15 years ago and had been searching
  for the same satisfaction from the multitude of Monk recordings
  from the Blue Note Years, Presitge, and Riverside. What Monk's
  Dream offered that the prior work lacked, was production. Raw,
  edgy, spontaneous ...yes all those recordings offered that. But I
  longed for that sense of confidence, tightness and richness of
  sound Monk's Deream provided. I found that in this set which
  makes sense since Monk's Dream came out of these sessions at
  Columbia. So what if these are reworks of the old stuff...they
  sound just as new and gripping
  &amp;amp;quot;produced&amp;amp;quot; as they did in their earlier
  days without big money helping out. WIll I throw out my older
  stuff and just play this? No chance..there is a time for polish
  and a time for purity</Text>
  <Text category="music">What makes a voice distinctive and
  memorable? Nat (King )Cole I believe had the smoothest voice of
  any male singer. Clarity and a sureness in phrasing was also
  gifts of his. Aside from 'Unforgettable' the songs I best
  remember are 'Mona Lisa' and 'Nature Boy'. But this recording
  also includes originals of the 'Nat King Cole trio'. It also
  includes the famous duet put together of 'Unforgettable' from his
  early version and his daughter Natalie Cole's recording made
  after he had passed on. That particular recording was a
  'knockout' sentimental and beautiful.</Text>
  <Text category="music">This is their best studio album. What more
  can I say? Brokedown Palace may be the most beautiful rock song
  of all time. A must</Text>
  <Text category="music">I purchased my first Weill recordings in
  1960, the off-broadway Threepenny Opera, and Lenya's Berlin
  Theater Songs. I have treasured them all my life. Lenya was, of
  course, incomparable, but Ute Lemper carries on her special
  genius. This new recording is as near a perfect realization of
  this unique masterpiece. John Mauceri gives the unique
  orchestration nuance that even Klemperer missed in his masterful
  Kleine Dreigroschenmusik. Every member of the cast, even the bit
  roles, is perfect in the characterization. Kollo is the first
  performer since Harald Paulsen (the origninal Mackie Messer) to
  bring all of the tradition of Viennese operetta to this music. He
  is a miracle. Macheath has subtle characteriztion hitherto
  unknown except from Paulsen. Most noteworthy is the Jenny of
  Milva. Two delightful bonuses in the recording: a reprise in Act
  2 of Seerauber Jenny by Milva (the Jenny) and the inclusion of
  Lucy Brown's aria after the Jealousy duet. There is brief dialog
  before most pieces which adds a dramatic integrity to the
  recording. I cannot find high enough praise for this new
  treasure</Text>
  <Text category="music">I admit when I listened to this album I
  was blown away by the powerful content of Kenny G's music. I was
  moved by the story line and also by the music that was used
  during the movie. Kenny G's music is perfect for this kind of
  movie. Not only that it adds flavor to the movie by his sensual
  playing of saxophone but also adds mood to the entire show. This
  is the perfect soundtract for the movie Dying Young because it
  just simply shows the real mood in the movie</Text>
  <Text category="music">That Nigga's Crazy and Bicentennial Nigger
  both surpass this album in laughs, but it would still rank high
  if it wasn't for the poor sound quality--there's a few audience
  members who can be heard a lot more clearly than Pryor himself
  half the time. But some great classic bits, and believe me you're
  never bored</Text>
  <Text category="music">THREE SIX MAFIA has out done there self
  with this new guy CHROME about every song is decent which is hard
  to find these days</Text>
  <Text category="music">This talented woman can sing anything. I
  really enjoyed this cd with the lights turned down and a glass of
  wine to relax after a very stressful day at work. Renee could
  definitely have another singing career outside of opera should
  she choose. Hearing her drop that gorgeous voice down one octave
  rivals the best chanteuses in the business - Cassandra Wilson,
  Nancy Wilson, Regina Belle, Sarah Vaughan, etc. This cd of
  different musical styles reminds me of Nina Simone and Cassandra
  Wilson, two great singers whom could interpret any song genre and
  make their versions special. I loved all the songs and the
  standouts here are "Haunted Heart", "River", "My One and Only
  Love", "My Cherie Amour", "Cancao do Amor", and Beatles "In My
  Life", and "Hard Times Come Again No More". I hope Renee keeps
  recording whatever catches her fancy because I'll certainly
  always listen</Text>
  <Text category="music">I can't believe the harshness of some of
  the comments on this album. Not a lot of in between among the
  notices -- those that hate are mean and heartless. Very hurtful.
  Lousy counterpoint to her warmth. I don't think they understand
  that she doesn't have to lose control to be meaningful and
  touching. Take her as an original instead of as a mimic. What do
  I hear? I love her lush voice on this album and Fred Hersch's
  brilliant piano accompaniment. Bill Frisell is very good, too. I
  love jazz &amp;amp; pop as well as opera. Ren?e Fleming can make
  it any of these genres. These songs are very much her own
  interpretation. They are 'deeper' than what you've heard before.
  Even if I prefer Nancy Wilson or Eva Cassidy singing "You've
  Changed," Ren?e Fleming sings it warmly and beautifully, in her
  own style, and very touching, too. She's not carried by full
  orchestration, mostly just Fred and her. I was going to write
  that "My One and Only Love" was especially good, but as the cd
  kept playing, I must say that they are all especially good.
  Enjoy</Text>
  <Text category="music">When a young artist names her first two
  albums not &amp;amp;quot;Judy&amp;amp;quot; or
  &amp;amp;quot;Collins&amp;amp;quot; but &amp;amp;quot;A Maid Of
  Constant Sorrow&amp;amp;quot; and &amp;amp;quot;Golden Apples Of
  The Sun&amp;amp;quot;,you know she takes herself
  seriously.Originaly released in 1961. and 1962. their names were
  all I knew until I saw this CD recently.&amp;amp;quot;Who will
  buy this?&amp;amp;quot; I wondered just to see the only copy
  snatched right in front of me.The comparisons with first two Baez
  albums are inevitable (some songs were recorded by both)
  althought Collins shows much more passion and involment where
  Baez seemingly seduces herself with the beauty of her voice.On
  these early albums Collins is frighteningly devoted keeper of the
  flame and her repertoire is almost exclusively traditional -
  which means not only ethereal beauty but also a certain (to some
  ears,overpowering) seriousness,cleverly mellowed by inclusion of
  joyous &amp;amp;quot;O Daddy Be Gay&amp;amp;quot;,a cousin to her
  &amp;amp;quot;Grandfather&amp;amp;quot; recorded years
  later.Althought I honestly love these songs and listen only this
  CD for days,these early albums are today much more significant as
  seeds of Collins later trademarks (voice will soar much higher in
  the future,she slipped W.B.Yeats into traditional folk collection
  just to later blossom into first-rate art-pop singer) and as they
  were product of their Greenwich Village times,they may sound a
  bit dated to some modern ears.But they are still hauntingly
  beautiful to me,I waited their re-release for too long</Text>
  <Text category="music">Excellent 24 track compilation of this
  surperb psychedelic Dutch band. Each tune was a single sometime
  between 1965-69. These guys are NOT to be confused with a U.S.
  band from the same era of the same name. Cuts that make this CD a
  true keeper are "Sun's Going Down", the tripping "Feel Like I
  Wanted To Cry", "Keep On Trying", the familiar sounding "Touch"
  and "Ballad Of John B". This is yet ANOTHER band I've heard at
  least one or two tracks on the Rhino release of 'Original
  Artyfacts: Nuggets II' 4-CD box set.Should appeal to fans of
  Pretty Things,Q65,early Beatles,Creation and The Action.A
  must-have</Text>

  <Text category="music">I put off buying this for many years.
  Having heard many posthumous albums that were just hideous, I
  didn't want to taint my perceptions of the Queen legacy. So I
  ignored this album. Then, one day, I was listening to Innuendo
  and that old curiosity crept in again. I came here and read many
  positive reviews, so I took the plunge. I came out the other side
  very content. The legacy had not been tainted. The album is
  uneven in places, but the songs that are good are VERY good
  (Mother Love, Let me Live). With some albums like this, it is
  often easy to tell that the vocals were spliced in. Now, I don't
  know exactly how this was done, but the songs feel seamless, even
  the dance track "You Don't Fool Me," which I can picture being
  blasted at high volumes in a late-night club. Of course there is
  some sadness in the songs and that feeling that time is running
  out (especially in "Mother Love"), but upon the conclusion of the
  album, I want to say to the Brian and the boys (men), "You've
  done good.</Text>
  <Text category="music">Ms. Melua is from Georgia. Her voice is
  quite like the Swede, Lisa Ekdahl. Neither has range or power;
  both have a little girl voice and plenty of finesse. Both have
  musical partners. In Ms. Melua's case it is Mike Batt who is to
  her what Nelson Riddle was to Linda Rondstadt, except that, in
  addition to arranging and conducting and coaching, he writes
  songs. Most of this album are her and/or his songs. They are well
  written and well treated. They are are a careful team abnd do not
  cut corners. Mr. Batt, among many other things, worked with
  Steeleye Span and Art Garfunkel long ago. The original sogs are
  interesting and liquid pleasant in rendition. But my favorite cut
  is her rendering "Blues in the Night", which some might remember
  from Looney Tunes cartoons many decades past; "My mama done tole
  me..." it starts. Knowing she cannot belt it, instead she works
  it. One short note on Steve Sale's engineering because another
  reviewer was crabbing about reverb and above all, clipping.
  Perhaps because I bought it on vinyl, but I hear none of these
  defects. My set is revealing, and it reveals excellent
  engineering, considering the largeish ensemble Mr. Batt has
  assembeled. Fear not, unless the CD really is badly made</Text>
  <Text category="music">Watching the Melvins evolve was extremely
  interesting and entertaining. They began as an unassuming punk
  band, and proceded to incorporate the heaviness of 70's rock into
  their sound. Then they stripped away any and all of the "punk"
  trappings and went for pure HEAVY. It all culminated with this
  record. It just doesn't get any heavier than 'Roman Bird Dog/Hung
  Bunny'. 'With Teeth', rumored to actually be written by Joe
  Preston, is one of my all time favorite Melvins songs. Speaking
  of Joe Preston, he was the by far best of the Melvins' 7000+
  bassists they had over the years. Shame they got rid of him
  shortly after this album. As soon as they fired him, they went
  straight down the greased pole to mediocrity Hell. Bad karma.
  Thank God that rock bands record their music so that it isn't
  lost forever every time they make stupid decisions. The only song
  on this record which I don't like is the cover of Alice Cooper's
  'The Ballad of Dwight Fry'. Thankfully they made up for it with a
  cover of Flipper's 'Sacrifice'. Some of the Melvins' subsequent
  records have their moments (Stoner Witch's 'Shevil', Stag's
  'Cotton Mouth'), but for the most part it seems to me that the
  Melvins gave up the ghost after recording this. Maybe someday
  they'll make a comeback</Text>
  <Text category="music">When I bought this CD it was for a little
  bit of nostalgia - Those Were The Days. Since playing it once
  when it blew me away with the tracks and the memories, I have
  played it so often that if it were vinyl it would be worn out by
  now. If you liked Mary Hopkins then this is a fantastic selection
  of her music and well worth a place in your collection</Text>
  <Text category="music">I am a
  Motown,Oldies,R&amp;amp;amp;b,Soul,Love Songs, music Lover.I like
  the songs that hit the heart and soul and hearing them brings
  back memories that come alive to the rhythem and Bill Withers
  definately fits right in there. I don't realy have a favorite
  artist because I like sooooo many of them but if I had to pick my
  top 10, this album would be in there</Text>
  <Text category="music">no diggity was a monster hit in 1996. If

  <Text category="music">I just saw the movie and throughly enjoyed
  the performance by all the actors involved. Kevin Spacey has a
  velvety, smooth voice. I was surprised to learn his background is

  rocks!!! Love the music! I highly recommend you buying the CD and
  the DVD</Text>
  <Text category="music">All of the Isleys early work without the
  younger Isleys is just as good with them. But these early
  workouts are more raw-stripped down and pop-oriented. Ron Isley
  has a way of making country, and rock remakes sound like they
  were never before recorded. Not too many black artists can do
  that. To get a taste of the &amp;amp;quot;Real
  Isleys&amp;amp;quot; before the &amp;amp;quot;Mr.
  Biggs&amp;amp;quot; persona, get this with &amp;amp;quot;Get into
  something&amp;amp;quot;, and &amp;amp;quot;Givin' it

  <Text category="music">Julieta Venegas did it again. She scored
  an album that is not alternative in style, however it is very
  catchy pop music. Her melodies are perfect for a morning drive
  with the radio on. You can sing along and express day to day
  feelings. Julieta continues to use instruments I like such as the
  harmonica. And of course, Julietas nice character and her lovely
  behavior shine through in her public appearances. My personal
  favorite is "Me voy", a very positive song about a not so
  positive event, breaking-up. Keep up the good work, Julieta. Your
  songs are appreciated.</Text>

  Comfortable Liar 3. Send The Pain Below 4. Closure 5. The Red 6.
  Wonder What's Next And my favorite track is #2 it sounded so

  <Text category="music">...heart-wrenching break-up with his
  girlfriend of 8 years, Elastica's Justine Frishmann. 13 is a dark
  record, produced by William Orbit. Nearly every song is injected
  with despair, sorrow, bitterness, and an achy, heart-breaking
  sadness. These moods are encompassed on such tracks as Tender,
  1992, Battle, and the tear-jerking No Distance Left to Run. Also
  included are the trip-hop masterpiece Trimm Trabb, the humourous
  Trailerpark and B.L.U.R.E.M.I., and Coxon and Albarn's co-written
  pop-masterpiece, Coffee and TV</Text>
  <Text category="music">The relaxation set is just that, pure
  relaxation. I love the active relaxation CD. I can read or work
  and I am real calm, on an even keel, feeling like when you go to
  sleep at night, not quite asleep and not quite awake. I also
  enjoy the water and the piano playing. Highly recommended</Text>
  <Text category="music">Ministry Of Sound has always had the
  reputation of putting out the best music. They have a way of
  findind the best DJ's, Artists, producers and remixers from the 4
  corners of the earth and bringing them to us on a CD. This CD is
  no exception. Soothing beats without lacking in tempo or energy,
  this CD could literally be enjoyed by a cowbow from Kentucky.
  It's just that palattable</Text>
  <Text category="music">It all started when I was a little kid and
  my dad gave me this album (he wasn't a fan, he probably picked it
  up with a crate of used records.) It was one of my first
  exposures to rock and roll. Nearly 30 years later I still own the
  original vinyl (the one that had the exploding fire extinguisher
  rooster album cover.) I am glad to have it now on CD, the vinyl
  being about as scratched and pitted as can possibly be and still
  be remotely playable. I dissent the reviewers who praise DuCann
  over Crane, for really, it IS after all Vincent Crane's project
  (Crane, also organist for Crazy World of Arthur Brown.) A
  keyboard player myself I consider Crane one of my biggest
  influences and I hold great admiration for his playing. DuCann
  and Hammond also deserve praise for their performances, but it
  should be painfully obvious who the star of an organ driven rock
  band is: Um, the audience ... er, no the organist! Take a trip
  back in time and enjoy this classic work</Text>
  <Text category="music">This is such an good industrial album,
  that I was sitting and listening to it and all the adjectives
  that I wanted to use seemed not good enough. However, if I have
  to put one then it has to be these, brilliant, astounding,
  stupendous and awesome. This is probably one of the best
  industrial albums of all time. The first track is good and then
  it just gets better and better. In fact the first track is not as
  good as the other ones and could have been replaced with another
  track. The book-let is ok but the lyrics are missing, but still
  it is an important release since it showed that inudtrial bands
  are tallented muisicians and can sing. Minphaser, Life Line, Guna
  are some of the best made industrial tracks ever with the
  intricate layers of sounds, bets and samples. The keyboard sounds
  are constantly amazing and this is an album not to be missed if
  one likes industrial music</Text>
  <Text category="music">Adios Marks the real goodbye from KMFDM.
  After they went on to do MDFMK which was decent and then they
  came back. Attak, was really weak because it was all Sascha and
  Skold and though I like them both, the absence of Gunter Schulz
  and En Esch really made this album absent in itself. WWIII though
  it is a better and pretty decent album, KMFDM is still a little
  less present. Adios gives us the remnants of what KMFDM fans know
  as KMFDM with Skold present but not taking over completely
  (Though I like Skold, But we need a break) We saw Nina Hagen lend
  her voice in "Witness" which is amazing, along with Ogre from
  Skinny Puppy in "That's All" and "Full Worm Garden" great tracks
  A little bit of Pig and Schulz's insane guitar riffs and you are
  all set. Even though En Esch was very minimal in the recording,
  infact I barely remember him... Currently Working on "FUBAR",
  we'll see if KMFDM will impress again, They have it still, they
  are just not using their talents as of late, C'mon Sascha, you're
  great man, but get over yourself and get Schulz and Esch back...
  Bring back KMFDM... What would Skinny Puppy be without Cevin Key?
  what would Ohgr be without Ogre? What would Foetus be without
  Thirlwell? c'mon man.. Bring us back KMFDM...</Text>
  <Text category="music">My 8-month-old son and I listen to this CD
  every night, and by the Pachelbel Canon (track 7) he's usually
  sound asleep. It is NOT ALL SYNTHESIZER. The jacket clearly
  states that the "Music Box Orchestra" includes flute, piano,
  cello, percussion, english horn, and oboe. As a musician, I am
  not offended by the "easy-listening" versions of these classics.
  In fact, I enjoy them. They introduce my son to the timeless
  melodies WITHOUT OVERSTIMULATING HIM at bedtime. I find them
  relaxing too</Text>
  <Text category="music">This CD was well worth the wait! It
  contains music and artists that were previously unavailable and
  not even heard on the radio in years. I took one of the CDs out
  of the box, put it in the player, and within minutes my wife and
  I were dancing. The sound quality, in my judgment is solid, the
  packaging is fun and creative, and the booklet containing the
  Cameo Parkway "story" was an interesting read. There will always
  be arguments about stuff that was included and not included, but
  this is an excellent overview of a wonderful era. What great fun
  to hear the Orlons, Chubby Checker, The Tymes, The Dovells, Bobby
  Rydell, and Dee Dee Sharp once again.</Text>
  <Text category="music">I can't say enough how great this album
  is. Grant Green was one of the most soulful jazz guitarists who
  ever graced the planet. His soloing on this CD is filled with
  beautiful melodicism matched with a bluesy grit that is such a
  pleasure to listen to. And for me as a guitarist it has been an
  encyclopedia of how to play blues from a jazz perspective. My
  favorites are &amp;amp;quot;Miss Ann's Tempo&amp;amp;quot; and
  &amp;amp;quot;Blues for Willarene&amp;amp;quot;. It is such a
  shame that he died so young and never collected his just
  due</Text>
  <Text category="music">This is one of my personal favorites. I

  definitely a benefit for me</Text>
  <Text category="music">I was introduced to Nitin through my
  cousin who lives in England. She saw him live in London and raved
  about it...so off I went in search of this artist. He was
  difficult to find; nonetheless I was determined. I am one of
  those people who love music from almost all genres, cultures and
  corners of the globe. In other words, I am not a radio-pop
  saccharine sweet loving music listener. I look for music that
  proposes thought (although I do believe even top 40 has its
  place) If you are looking for an album/artist that resonates
  emotion, along with a powerful subtlety check Nitin Sawhney out.

  contribution to modern art. This particular volume (Vol. 14)
  features Grainger's settings of various folk and popular songs

  <Text category="music">This is Jeff Beck's best album. A
  masterpiece of guitar work. This is an all instrumental album
  that features what Jeff does best - play guitar. The supporting
  band is excellent especially the drum work. Production quality is
  excellent as well. While I wouldn't consider JB a blues guitarist
  I would consider him one of the top 10 guitarist ever and this
  album show cases why. A great companion album to Blow by Blow is
  Wired. It's a shame that after Wired his record company made him
  go back to albums with vocals. He has on a roll and at a level
  that he has rarely gotten back to. If you like guitar and can
  live without vocals buy this album. You will not be
  disappointed</Text>

  <Text category="music">Lead singer and co-founder David Gates was
  recently inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame. This album
  is one prime example of why. David has consistently provided
  beautiful melodies with easy, sensitive lyrics. His last album
  was a country album called &amp;amp;quot;Love Is Always
  Seventeen,&amp;amp;quot; which was a genre-crossing mix of pop
  and country, co-produced and performed with Billy Dean. But back
  to this gem. &amp;amp;quot;Guitar Man,&amp;amp;quot; and
  &amp;amp;quot;Aubrey&amp;amp;quot; were the big hits off of this
  album, and they still stand the test of time.
  &amp;amp;quot;Tecolote&amp;amp;quot; is one of their most unusual
  departures, and still makes me laugh, while enjoying its
  musicality and orignality. &amp;amp;quot;Didn't Even Know Her
  Name&amp;amp;quot; is a poignant lost love song;
  &amp;amp;quot;Welcome to the Music&amp;amp;quot; is one of those
  opening songs bands sometimes did to orient their fans to what to
  expect. Even Larry Knechtel gets in on the vocals with the
  intriguing &amp;amp;quot;Picture in My Mind.&amp;amp;quot; It's a
  great album---in fact, there's not a bad
  &amp;amp;quot;Bread&amp;amp;quot; album out there! Enjoy, and

  the reviews. I have another Streetwize CD that I love, but I was
  a litter weary about getting this one (Jazz meets Dre and all).
  But I am glad I made the purchase, as I am thoroughly enjoying
  it</Text>
  <Text category="music">Like many before me,this "blue" Beatles
  best-of served as my first,in-depth sampling of The Beatles'
  output from their post-'Revolver' era from early-1967 onward...
  You couldn't find a better 100+ minutes of music to listen to
  straight through than the superb 28 tracks that make up 'The
  Beatles 1967-1970'. I bought this initially back in the winter of
  1988 (I was 18 at the time) on cassette,and it changed my life.
  True; the 2-cd version often retails at $34.00,which is a bit
  much,but the material contained is beyond priceless.. About the
  songs. The songs!! There's not a lame one among the batch of 28.
  What's even cooler is that -even as the songs unfurl
  chronologically- they pack a flow to rival any of anyone's
  favorite best-of albums... The flow of all 28 is remarkable... A
  fantastic mix of all their late '60's #1 hits as well as choice
  album cuts ("A Day In The Life","I Am The Walrus")... Seriously
  folks; anyone who is feeling the itch to discover The Beatles'
  later output should get this "blue" best-of first,then graduate
  onto the studio albums themselves.. That's what happened to me
  and I wound up (so far) buying all of the albums from 'Rubber
  Soul' (1965) onwards... This blue '1967-1970' never disappoints.
  Because the liner notes/inlay booklet doesn't tell you which
  album each track is culled from,I'll happily fill you in: Disc
  One: 1.)Strawberry Fields Forever(John in vocals) 2.)Penny
  Lane(Paul on vocals) (Both originally released as a stand-alone
  single in early 1967 and both served as the first tracks recorded
  for what would be 1967's "Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band".
  However,the two songs weren't released on any Beatles' album
  until late-1967's 'Sgt. Pepper' follow-up 'Magical Mystery
  Tour'.) 3.)Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band(Paul on vocals)
  4.)With A Little Help From My Friends (Ringo on vocals) 5.)Lucy
  In The Sky With Diamonds(John on vocals) 6.)A Day In The
  Life(John and Paul on vocals) 3-6 from the legendary 'Sgt.
  Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band'; 1967. 7.)All You Need Is Love
  (John on vocals) 8.)I Am The Walrus(John on vocals)
  9.)Hello,Goodbye(Paul on vocals) 10.)The Fool On The Hill (Paul
  on vocals) 11.)Magical Mystery Tour(John on vocals) 7-11 from
  'Magical Mystery Tour'; 1967 12.)Lady Madonna(Paul on vocals)
  13.)Hey Jude(Paul on vocals) 14.)Revolution(John on vocals) 12-14
  all stand-alone singles released in 1968. All were/are huge hits.
  Sweet! Disc Two: 1.)Back In The U.S.S.R.(Paul on vocals) 2.)While
  My Guitar Gently Weeps(George on vocals)
  3.)Ob-La-Di,Ob-La-Da(Paul on vocals) 1-3 taken from 1968's
  double-album 'The Beatles' (aka "The White Album"). 4.)Get
  Back(Paul on vocals) (Originally recorded 1969 as a single and
  not released on album until 1970's 'Let It Be'. Twistedly,'Let It
  Be' was recorded prior to 1969's final Beatles' studio album
  'Abbey Road',but not released until later...) 5.)Don't Let Me
  Down(non-album b-side to the "Get Back" single; John on vocals)
  6.)The Ballad Of John And Yoko (non-LP stand-alone single; John
  on vocals. One of the very few Beatles tracks recorded with only
  John and Paul playing all the instruments..) 7.)Old Brown
  Shoe(b-side to "The Ballad Of John And Yoko"; George on vocals)
  All of the hits plus some choice b-sides as well.. Yeah!! 8.)Here
  Comes The Sun(George on vocals) 9.)Come Together(John on vocals)
  10.)Something(George on vocals) 11.)Octopus's Garden (Ringo on
  vocals) (All culled from 1969's *true* final Beatle
  masterpiece,'Abbey Road') 12.)Let It Be (Paul on vocals)
  13.)Across The Universe(John on vocals) 14.)The Long And Winding
  Road (Paul on vocals) 12-14 from 1970's (actually recorded early
  1969) 'Let It Be'. So there you go... 28 of THE very best music
  ever to grace the world... (Seriously.) Please do yourself a
  favor and check out *any* Beatles' music. But a choice place to
  start certainly is here. Have Fun/Enjoy/Peace! Thanks for your
  time. Tim Goyer Albany,NY USA 6/28/0</Text>
  <Text category="music">Sombre Romantic is a step up if you will
  in the gothic metal genre. It is a very solid album from start to
  finish but has alot of layers that keep things interesting. Its
  not what you would really consider to be a "religious" album but
  there are many undertones that help get the message across. This
  point being made very clear in "Museum of Iscariot" which talks
  of Jesus from Judas' point of view. Rowan's vocal stylings change
  to meet the moods of every song on this album, from low opera
  type to screaming, in a superb way that stays consistent and
  never gets old. If you are into relaxed darkwave/goth music this
  is a perfect album to purchase</Text>
  <Text category="music">This is a great Movie Soundtrack!. I'm a
  PASSPORT Fan since I was a kid back in the 70's. I have all Klaus
  Doldinger's official releases with his Passport signature. Please
  go and look for this CD "Running In Real Time" from Passport and
  listen to track number 2: Auryn. Then go and get all his Passport
  releases (almost 20 CDs since the 70's). Then you will see why
  Klaus Doldinger is very creative</Text>

  <Text category="music">After leaving (or being dismissed from)
  Pink Floyd in 1968 due to his LSD use &amp;amp; erratic
  behaviour, singer/songwriter/guitarist Syd Barrett re-emerged in
  1970 with his debut solo album, "The Madcap Laughs." The album
  did not come easy, as Syd never fully recovered from his drug
  use, and it clearly shows in his ragged performances on "Madcap
  Laughs." Producer Malcolm Jones did what he could with Syd for
  about half of the album, before handing the production reigns
  over to Barrett's former Floyd mates Roger Waters &amp;amp; David
  Gilmour to finish the job. Throughout the album, bum notes are
  played, beats are missed, and Barrett sings off-key. And on the
  rocker songs, the session players (from the group The Soft
  Machine) sound like they are struggling to keep up with Syd, who
  could hit a rough patch at any moment. For any other artist, this
  would all be nothing short of disastrous. And YET....in the case
  of Syd Barrett, any and all mistakes are immediately forgiven.
  Why? Because Barrett's songs on "The Madcap Laughs" are all
  wonderfully written, and although Syd's voice and guitar-playing
  are obviously not in tip-top condition, you can plainly hear on
  this album that he's trying. He's really, really *trying* to do
  his best, and his efforts really do shine through. For every bum
  note there's a passage that Syd plays beautifully, for every
  missed beat there are many beats that are hit right on schedule,
  and for every note that Syd sings off-key, there are many moments
  where his very distinctive, British voice is magical. And of
  course, there's Syd's lyrics. You may not know what all of them
  actually *mean*, really, but to my ears, they're still poetry.
  The rockers are still powerful ("No Good Trying," "No Man's
  Land," the rockabilly fun of "Here I Go," and the classic
  "Octopus"), and the softer numbers still have great beauty to
  them ("Terrapin," the passionate "Dark Globe," the effective
  "Golden Hair"---based on a James Joyce poem---and "Long Gone").
  Even the more ragged numbers like "Feel" and "If It's In You,"
  somehow still hang together quite well (amusingly, we even hear
  some brief banter from Syd in the middle of "If It's In You," as
  his voice goes wildly off the map, he stops playing, prepares for
  another take, and finally gets through the song). When all is
  said and done, "The Madcap Laughs," warts and all, is an
  excellent album. It is a flawed masterpiece, and it shows that
  Syd Barrett, even with his mind irreversibly fractured by this
  point, was still a genius musician.</Text>
  <Text category="music">Though I am only 33 years old, I grew up
  listening to Bob Wills. Merle Haggard did a great job with this
  one (as he always does). I got goose bumps listening to it. It
  took me back to my childhood when I would sit on the porch with
  my Grandfather listening to Bob Wills. The only thing missing is
  the scratching of the needle on a nearly worn-out album</Text>
  <Text category="music">This is just a great CD. Whenever I need
  to restore inner harmony after work, or dealing with any
  upsetting situation, this is the one I go to. Instantly I am
  transported to the calm, soothing setting of a traditional
  Japanese house and garden. It is fantastic for meditation, too.
  Let all the nonessentials of life slip away while you listen to
  this beautiful recording</Text>
  <Text category="music">Del the Funky Homosapien has been my
  favorite MC for years, and this album doesn't dissapoint. The DVD
  is raw, and packs in lots of live footage, interviews, and is
  well produced. If you are a fan of Del, you know you have to pick
  this up.</Text>
  <Text category="music">Metheny's an innovator and has been all
  over the map over his long career in terms of styles, moods,
  textures, and sounds. Here we have an early effort in which he
  takes his guitar and overdubs an introspective, wide-open-spaces
  musical journey across America, weaving in jazz, folk, country,
  rock, mountain music, and everything in between. If you love his
  work on Joni Mitchell's Amelia (performed live on Shadows and
  Light), you'll love the sound of this record. The mood is mellow
  but not dull, quiet but not silent, and the results are
  spectacular. This is the cd to take with you on a trip across the
  western frontier, or a short hop to Burger King. Works either
  way</Text>
  <Text category="music">Tame's music is all about the beat. It's
  what got me right from the start, a grinding, repetitious
  backbone to every song. Tame One rides every beat on these tracks
  without faltering and shows some true style in his delivery. Tame
  gets rid of the verse-hook standarda, periodically ad-libing and
  allows the music to play when he feels like pausing. Its an
  amazing album well worth purchasing.</Text>
  <Text category="music">while i am not a big fan of john
  mcLaughlin or mahvishnu orchestra - i cannot deny that they
  really had something with this album.. It is something new - not
  just an extension of miles davis - they were breaking new
  territory... There is a cohesiveness amongst the band members -
  of course abounding with improvisational talent - this is fushion
  but first of all it is music</Text>
  <Text category="music">I bought this CD before going to see MMW
  (with John Scofield) for the first time at First Avenue in
  Minneapolis Dec 7, 2006. I had never heard of them before and
  liked the clip on the venue's website. So I bought a ticket and
  wanted to get "Out Louder", which I knew they were going to play,
  to familiarize myself, but the store I was at was out of it. So I
  bought "End of the World" instead. While some of it was a little
  too spacey for my liking at first, I still liked the overall
  funkiness of it all. THEN....I saw them PLAY. You MUST see them
  PLAY!! I didn't ever want it to end! I immediately wanted to see
  them again! It's less than a week later and I have 2 more CD's
  ("Out Louder" and Scofield's "A-Go-Go" which they "back" him on)
  and 4 more on the way from amazon as I'm writing this. I'm like
  an ADDICT now! I HAVE to have them on in the car and in the
  house. I get back in the car after having been in a store or
  whatever and they're on and all is right with my world again. I
  must say I like "Out Louder" and even "A-Go-Go" better than "End
  of the World", but only slightly. It IS trippy with the synth and
  the other guest players, and I do like it better after a few
  listens. I just prefer MMW with less guest musicians</Text>
  <Text category="music">I cannot stop listening to the song I
  Saved The World Today. The CD is worth the price for this song
  alone. The whole CD is great though ... classic Eurythmics that
  sounds as great today as their earlier work. Annie Lennox gets
  all the attention ... and she deserves every bit, but Dave
  Stewart certainly deserves as much. They make a great team and
  this CD should have been given much more attention in the USA. I
  hope they don't take so long to do another one</Text>

  <Text category="music">As a former piano major I can assure those
  who would purchase this dusc that it is well worth it.
  Reminiscent (dare I say it?) of Horowitz</Text>
  <Text category="music">as with all of Zucchero's CD's, this is
  also wonderful. I listen to it all the time, it's sensual and
  sexy and great</Text>
  <Text category="music">Trip hop and lounge lovers need to have
  this CD at home. Bajo Fondo Tango Club is not as pure tango as
  Piazzola's nor as chill out percolated as Gotan Project's, which
  makes them a band for all publics. Nor even one single person in
  my office couldn't help download at least one song of this CD
  into their ipods. Three of them already bought their copy</Text>
  <Text category="music">It was good. There are so many albums like
  this. This is one of the good ones</Text>
  <Text category="music">This is an amazing EP - one of Boards of
  Canada's strongest to date. Honestly, I didn't enjoy Dayvan
  Cowboy that much on Campfire Headphase, but since it has been
  recontectualized on Trans Canada Highway, I'm a huge fan of the
  song. The new tracks are more like what one would typically
  expect from Boards of Canada. Warm, fuzzy, mellow, lush analogue
  synths and plenty of them! For those who weren't as taken with
  the newer BOC sound on Campfire Headphase, assuage your fears -
  this is definitely a return to the traditional sound. That's not
  to say though that this is a rehash of old material. One can hear
  bits and pieces of Geogaddi and such, but the overall feel is
  much closer to Music Has the Right to Children. To all Boards of
  Canada fans - buy this without hesitation. It doesn't matter what
  you thought of Campfire - this is quality. I have one question.
  The title, Trans Canada Highway, seems to be a fairly obvious
  reference to Kraftwerk's legendary Trans Europe Express and the
  album cover seems to point to Kraftwerk's Autobahn album cover,
  but I don't hear any explicit musical connection. Is Boards of
  Canada paying a simple titular tribute to Kraftwerk, or is there
  something else buried within? This calls for repeated
  listenings</Text>
  <Text category="music">I thoroughly enjoy this collection of hits
  from The Mamas and the Papas. Every song is fun and the tunes
  will stay with you long after you're done listening. Like other
  selections from the 20th Century Masters series, this can't be
  called a complete collection. However, what is included is
  fantastic and I find myself popping it into my CD player much
  more often than many other CDs. My copy of this CD (which I
  bought new) includes an 8-page folder with two photos of the band
  (besides the cover photo), a short band biography written by
  Joseph F. Laredo, and a track listing with song writing and
  original release credits. Song lyrics are not included. The jewel
  case is fully transparent with another photo of the band on the
  inside of the back paper. As a side note, if you are a fan of the
  ABC television series "Lost" this CD includes the Mama Cass song
  "Make Your Own Kind Of Music" that is featured on Desmond's
  record player in the hatch. If you're just starting with The
  Mamas and the Papas, or simply want a brief overview of some of
  their better known songs, this is a great CD. For more The Mamas
  and the Papas, check out Criterion's phenomenal DVD release of
  Monterey Pop (or the box set The Complete Monterey Pop Festival).
  This concert DVD is absolutely brilliant, and includes several
  songs from The Mamas and the Papas.</Text>
  <Text category="music">Those who liked Suede may be looking for
  more of the same from The Tears, but despite the obviously
  recognisable vocals from Brett, and the familiar wailing of
  Bernard's guitar, this marks a watershed in their repertoire. The
  most obvious difference is that all the songs seem to have been
  crafted as 'hits' (much more radio-friendly, and why not?). It's
  also a more mellow sound than Suede (there were fewer
  opportunities for vigorous bouncing and hand-clapping at the
  Tears concert I attended). Another important difference is the
  guitar work, with Bernard soaring off into sonic highs not
  experienced since Reeves Gabrels and Tin Machine. Among the
  better songs are Apollo 13, Brave New Century, Refugees and
  Co-Star. Though Brett and Bernard are capable of better, this is
  a shot in the arm for us disenfranchised Suede-heads, and I
  recommend you turn it up loud</Text>
  <Text category="music">I was in Walmart's electronic area (which
  is where you can usually find me!) and I saw the album. I heard
  Unbelieveable and I was sold on that song but couldn't find the
  single. The album on first listen was not my favorite, but after
  a while I started liking it. It is a great album and I'm glad I
  bought it. Talent is a virtue!</Text>
  <Text category="music">This is one of my favorites of 2004. You
  got a seasoned vet of an MC rockin over some of the illest
  producers in underground hip hops beats(madlib, j-zone,
  dangermouse) and some pretty nice guest appearances. I have a
  couple of complaints on this album though, like the song "Love
  Thang", the hook is wack and the beat is corny, another wack hook
  comes thru on the title track where you got Prince Po sounding
  Like Tonto from Lone Ranger chanting some indian ish, and on top
  of that in his rhyme he says some sh*t like "and if the girl
  farts then she's a pooter"??? thats dumb. One last complaint then
  i'm done hatin, but the chorus on Bump Bump is terrible, and i'm
  embarrased to bump bump that ish when i'm in my car because it
  sounds so wack, but Raekwon's verse takes me back to when Wu Tang
  was the untouchable squad they were back in the mid 90's, which
  more than makes up for the lackluster chorus. Aside from those
  complaints you got a dope album, J-Zone hit this up with some of
  best beats i've ever heard from him. So pick this up its
  definitely a good purchase</Text>
  <Text category="music">Sometimes I like to look up and see what I
  can find on some of my favorite bands from the 70's and Starz
  being one of them. I was lucky enough to see the band play a few
  times around 77 and 78. Another band that took time for their
  fans!!!!!!! I read through the many reviews of posted here on
  amazon and not sure if there is much that I can add, also great
  to see that there were so many out there that enjoyed the band
  and their music. I would recommend reading about each of the
  Starz cd's and listening to the sound files if available and
  deciding for yourself........ I remember I liked this cd so much
  and the logo as well, I even hand- made a stencil and made my own
  Starz shirt, I think I used some of that gold "glue on glitter"
  in a tube and had one of the first Starz shirts, before the band
  even had any if I remember right. Lots of good songs on this cd,
  Pull the Plug being one of my favorites both on the LP/CD and
  live. All good rock songs from a band that deserved a lot
  more......... I could go on trying to describe the
  music.......... too bad there are no sound files for this
  cd....... so you may just have to order it and take a chance. The
  remaining members have played a few shows during the past year or
  so and guitar player Richie Ranno continues to be active in the
  music business, you may even want to go over to starzcentral to
  get updated and see what Richie and the band are up to. Singer
  Michael Lee Smith also had a brother that had his own band and
  later ventured into Hollywood....... but this is about
  Starz!!!...So.... I highly recommend checking out the CD's and
  starzcentral. Not to be confused with the movie channel or
  another band from Europe that is using the name recently</Text>

  <Text category="music">Many musicians release some sort of
  experimental album at some point in their career. For Peter
  Gabriel, every album is an experiment. Usually musicians
  experiment by deviating from the norm; however, on Gabriel's
  fifth experiment, SO, the ex-Genesis frontman does the exact
  opposite. Gabriel, beloved for always doing something different,
  decided on this album to play it safe - and for Gabriel, that is
  an experiment. Previously he was a sort of cult performer, but on
  SO, Gabriel finally made it into the spotlight. Big time. SO was
  an immense success, peaking at number one on the Billboard Top
  100, receiving overwhelmingly-positive reviews (in 2003, So
  placed 187th on Rolling Stone's list of the 500 greatest albums
  of all time), and resulting in a sold-out tour. Which brings us
  to one nagging term: "sellout". Though most who loved Peter
  Gabriel's first four albums loved SO as well, there are still
  many who call SO Gabriel's sellout album. To me, that's just
  foolishness. Peter Gabriel has never "sold out" and I have no
  doubt that he never will. It's clear that on SO he was trying to
  go in a more mainstream direction, but that's probably the
  biggest experiment Gabriel has ever undertaken, save for his
  subsequent release, PASSION. One popular theory amongst Gabriel
  fans is that the album's title, SO, is in fact an acronym for
  "Sell Out" (hence the uppercase capital "S" and the lowercase
  italicized "o"). I wouldn't be surprised at all if it was. SO
  does sound very different from Gabriel's earlier albums (though
  then again, none of those sounded alike either). If anything, it
  resembles Gabriel's third self-titled release, nicknamed MELT.
  The thing that really separates those two - other than an
  obviously more commercial sound on SO - is a feeling of warmth on
  that album, unlike the harsh, gritty darkness of MELT. Perhaps
  that's why listeners found SO so charming. What does SO have to
  offer? Well, a lot. For one thing, there's the atmospheric
  opening, "Red Rain", one of Gabriel's finest tracks. Like many of
  the tracks on the album, it's dominated by ethereal guitar from
  David Rhodes and heavenly synthesizers, courtesy of Gabriel
  himself. Then there's one of the biggest hits of 1980s (which
  also spawned what may be the best music video in history),
  "Sledgehammer," inspired by the motown music Gabriel listened to
  as a child. With its pounding, industrial percussion, playful
  bass (by Gabriel's exclusive bass man, Tony Levin) and clever,
  sexually suggestive lyrics, it's no surprise that "Sledgehammer"
  was a hit. After letting his silly side out, Gabriel tries to
  inspire with "Don't Give Up", a nice song made great by heavenly
  vocals from another popular 80s musician, Kate Bush. The
  subsequent track, "That Voice Again", is my personal favorite
  song from this album. It features some excellent drumming from
  Manu Katche, an immensely-talented drummer who has also played
  with artists like Sting, along with misty guitars, delightful
  synthesizers, and fine lyrics hit home by Gabriel's pained
  singing. Like the best tracks on SO, "That Voice Again" manages
  to be fun, moody, uplifting, powerful, warm, and inspirational,
  all at once. Gabriel winds down a little for the dreamy, powerful
  "Mercy Street", a song inspired by and written about Anne Sexton,
  an American mental patient who relieved her depression through
  writing. As on his previous albums, Gabriel proves that he knows
  when to lighten up by whipping out "Big Time", a silly but fun
  track which also spawned an innovative music video. "Big Time"
  features heavy drumming from Stewart Copeland, the former drummer
  of The Police, as well as some awesome CMI by Simon Clark. "We Do
  What We're Told (Miligram's 37)" is about the experiments of Yale
  professor Stanley Milgram. Milgram would have his subjects
  administer shocks to actors, who would scream in pain as the
  shocks became more and more horrible. Milgram observed that his
  subjects would do what he told them to do, despite the immense
  pain they appeared to be inflicting on the actors. He follows
  that rather cold song with "This Is The Picture (Excellent
  Birds)", a tensely surreal tune. The album closes with one of
  Gabriel's most famous songs, "In Your Eyes". Most people are
  familiar with the song from its usage in Cameron Crowe's romantic
  comedy masterpiece ... SAY ANYTHING, where the song was used in
  what has become one of the most famous scenes in movie history.
  It's one of Gabriel's warmest and most romantic compositions, and
  also one of his best. On the original LP version of SO, "We Do
  What We're Told" closed out the album. That's a fine way to end
  it, but it's also a rather cold way to end such a warm album.
  When the album was re-released remastered on CD in 2002, Gabriel
  placed "In Your Eyes" at the end of the album as he originally
  intended. Now that is the way to end it! So - how does SO rank
  among the many other brilliant works of Peter Gabriel? Well, it
  ranks quite highly, actually. It's one of the pinnacles of
  Gabriel's career, though whether it truly is the peak or not is
  hard to say. After all, how can one compare Gabriel's albums when
  they are all so vastly different? Certainly, though, SO is one of
  the finest Gabriel masterpieces. This is fun, well-crafted,
  emotional music. SO is SO wonderful.</Text>

  <Text category="music">Unless you frequented jazz clubs in
  Baltimore or Philly in the fall of 1955, this would have been
  your first exposure to the Miles Davis-John Coltrane
  collaboration (a few tracks recorded for Columbia, the label
  Miles would soon be joining exclusively, a few weeks before this
  session weren't issued until much later). Davis settled on
  Coltrane as his replacement for the departing Sonny Rollins
  almost by default - no one else fit the bill or new the book.
  That they would stay together long seemed unlikely because their
  temperaments differed so much (Davis was a hands-off leader,
  Coltrane wanted constant input from Miles on his playing and
  music in general). STABLEMATES (a Benny Golson tune) is the track
  that seems to draw the most attention. It's an excellent
  composition, and although Coltrane sounds somewhat tentative
  (nervous?), the performance is attractive. But my favorite side
  is THERE IS NO GREATER LOVE, even though Coltrane sits this one
  out: Miles plays beautifully, and I love the emotion he wrings
  from the tune. True, this is an early effort by the group that
  would transform modern jazz, but it's a very good session
  nonetheless. The group plays well, the rhythm section is rock
  solid, and they are all off and running. Full speed ahead</Text>

  <Text category="music">This is the best album/band noones ever

  <Text category="music">Martina McBride's "Emotion" album contains
  many pop country elements, but is still nonetheless a great
  album. Here's how I rate each song. (out of a 5 star scale) 1) Do
  What You Do- good song, but takes a little to get used to. (4
  stars) 2) Anything's Better than Feeling the Blues- good songs,
  good lyrics. (4 stars) 3) I Love You- great song, Martina's most
  successful song on the country charts, spending 5 weeks in the
  top spot. (5 stars) 4) Make Me Believe- great song about whether
  one's love is true or not.... i love the lyric "but it's hard to
  start a fire without a spark (5 stars) 5) Love's the Only House-
  this song will draw a strong connection to your heart. The song
  is spectacular and speaks the truth... love is TRULY the only
  house big enough for all the world's pain. The video to this song
  is very touching as well. Go Martina! (5 stars) 6) There You Are-
  a perfect wedding song... She hold the "are" note for at least
  12+ seconds near the end. (5 stars) If you hear this song LIVE,
  she holds the note 15 seconds!!!! (so LIVE this song will be 6
  stars/5 stars!!!!) 7) It's My Time- the first song that I ever
  heard Martina perform live in the AMA awards... she rocked the
  house down with this song... She also holds a 10 second note at
  this song. Love that range of hers. (5 stars) 8) I Ain't Goin'
  Nowhere- I like this song and its message about being there for a
  significant other. (5 stars) 9) Anything and Everything- the
  lyrics and Martina's gentle vocal performance on this song are
  perfection. (5 stars) 10)From the Ashes- another standout song on
  this album. She holds some high notes in this one too. (5 stars)
  11) Goodbye- a solid performance, I llike how Martina goes lower
  and softer in some parts of the song. (4 stars) 12) This Uncivil
  War- the best song on the album!!!! AMAZING!!!! Written by
  Gretchen, the writer of Martina's career hit "Indepedence Day." A
  very emotional song, which defines the title of the album. The
  ending is a real treat as well. (6 stars!) This album is
  definitely worth purchasing!!! It helps complete my collection of
  Martina's albums</Text>

  &amp;amp;quot;Moon River&amp;amp;quot; masterfully interpreted by

  <Text category="music">ALways loved this group....own several of
  their CD's and this is by far my favorite. Darryl Hall's phrasing
  of his songs are superb.</Text>
  <Text category="music">I agree with everyone else; the music on
  this album is completely magical. Two masters at work with a
  great rhythm section, very spontaneous-sounding contrapuntal
  harmonies, unbounded joy in every tune, and some interesting
  arrangements. This is also the worst-sounding CD (or LP, for that
  matter) that I have ever heard. It sounds worse than lo-res MP3s
  played over the Web; I have recordings of 78s that sound better.
  I cannot believe that even Laserlight would release this. I have
  other Laserlight Cds and none of them sound this bad. If they
  remastered this and made it sound better, I would buy it again.
  That's the only reason for 4 stars rather than 5. Still, it's
  worth getting if you can listen past the horrible sound
  quality</Text>
  <Text category="music">I am a latecomer to the works of Chopin,
  unqualified to comment on Dinu Lipatti's technique and
  interpretation, but this recording gives an interesting framework
  to explore the waltzes. They are numbered 1 through 14 in order
  of opus publication, but on this disc Lipatti shuffles them to
  form a cycle of his own devising. There are four waltzes in the
  key of A flat and it seems one challenge was to space them across
  the recital. Contrast this to Alexandre Thaurad's CD where he
  clumps like-key waltzes into groups. (He also adds five more
  posthumous works.) Most of Chopin's waltzes start on the
  dominant, meaning either the fifth note of the home key (the
  tonic, the I), or a dominant seventh chord (V7) which leads to
  the tonic. Lipatti uses this feature to string together his
  cycle. If, for instance, there were a waltz that ended on a C
  natural it could easily bring us to Waltz No 4, which starts on
  an insistent C7 chord before rising to the home key of F major. I
  will use this as the starting point for tracing the harmonic
  relationships of the tracks on this CD. Track 1: Waltz No 4 in F,
  "Grande Valse brillante" - as noted starts on the V7 and finishes
  on F in octaves. Track 2: No 5 in A flat - begins on a trilling
  dominant Eb, but the note it trills up to is an F (which ended
  the previous track). Finishes with a parting shot, a turn in the
  bass ending on Ab. Track 3: No 6 in D flat, "Minute Waltz" -
  starts on Ab; the contour of the opening phrase echoes the
  gesture of the previous parting shot as well. Ends in Db. Track
  4: No 9 in A flat - has two pick up notes then hits a Db on the
  downbeat of the first measure. The right hand ends on the Ab
  above middle C. Track 5: No 7 in C sharp minor - starts on a G
  sharp above middle C, which is the same black key (enharmonic
  equivalent) of the previous Ab. Ends in C# minor. Track 6: No 11
  in G flat - starts with a pick-up turn then hits the downbeat
  with a Db (enharmonic C#). Ends on a Gb in the treble clef. Track
  7: No 10 in B minor - starts quietly on the same note, an F#
  (enharmonic Gb). Ends with a soft B in the bass clef. Track 8: No
  14 in E minor - first note is the exact same B in the bass. Ends
  in E minor. Track 9: No 3 in A minor - starts on an E in the bass
  melody. Ends in A minor; keep in mind that minor third of this
  key is a C natural -- you can hear it in the melody of the third
  to last measure. Track 10: No 8 in A flat - this is a
  side-stepping change of keys, but there is an harmonic link to
  the previous waltz. Instead of starting on the dominant, this one
  begins on the major third -- C natural. Track 11: No 12 in F
  minor - starts on the dominant -- C again. Toggle back and forth
  between tracks 10 and 11 and you will hear that these two waltzes
  start on the exact same pitch. Instead of ending in F minor this
  waltz closes in the relative major of Ab. The last three notes
  are a rise and fall, Bb-C-Ab. Track 12: No 13 in D flat - there
  is a leading note before the dominant. The first three notes
  (Bb-Ab-F) fall and rise in a mirroring gesture to the final
  phrase of the previous. Ends quietly in Db. Track 13: No 1 in E
  flat, "Valse brillante" - another side-stepping key change but
  there is a connection. If you toggle between tracks 12 and 13 you
  will hear the same initial note, a Bb -- quietly in the former,
  boldly here. Finishes resoundingly in the tonic Eb. Track 14: No
  2 in A flat, "Grande Valse brillante" - introduction in the
  dominant chord, Eb7. Closes in Ab. From here you could loop
  around to the beginning of the cycle again, linking the major
  third (C natural) to the V7 that starts the F major waltz</Text>
  <Text category="music">Live Alive is good enough to buy in my
  standered's.....I really think this was recorded poorly but the
  songs on it are really good if you play it in your car, or on
  bigger speakers so you can really hear everything much better.
  Their are many good songs included on this complination of live
  performence's spanning from performences from Montreux Jazz
  Festival, Austin Opera House,and the Dallas Starfest. This
  recordings are all from 85-through 86. Jimmie Vaughan appears on
  Willie The Wimp, Love Struck Baby, Look At Little Sister, and
  Change It playing guitar, and string bass. I think the worst song
  on the entire complination is Voodoo Chile(slight return) which
  is kind of weird for me to say because I think that was truely
  the best song Stevie Ray played live but in this case its not.
  Other than that I really think for what it is it's a average live
  performence.</Text>
  <Text category="music">Just wanted to answer
  Reviewer:"homedecaramel" and his question as to who Melissa
  refers to from the song titled' "Melissa's Garden". Melissa was
  the daughter of close friends of Steve Vai. She passed away 5
  years ago at a fairly young age due to ovarian cancer. Melissa's
  parents built a beautiful garden as a remembrance of her. Melissa
  had a wonderful spirit and her spirit lives on as is apparent in
  Steve's beautiful tribute and in Melissa's Garden.</Text>
  <Text category="music">From the manic whirlwind Prelude to the
  shocking Cake and Sodomy, Portrait of an American family is an
  album that stands on its own two feet as being catchy and
  memorable. Cake and Sodomy dishes out the obscene gestures,
  Lunchbox is told with a twist of humor, Organ Grinder is pleasing
  vocally, Cyclops is addictingly wild, Get your gunn is catchy (if
  not overly insulting), Dope Hat is great and fierce, and My
  Monkey is hysterically enjoyable. Snake Eyes and Sissies is
  another winner, easy to get lost in. The rest all work to varying
  degrees, though not as appealing. Every song on this album is
  worth listening to, from fast paced and rock style to techno
  overload.</Text>
  <Text category="music">i love to working with this soundtrack in

  <Text category="music">This album was released in the summer of
  '86 when Queen's radio airplay was at a rather low point in the
  U.S. and at a very high point in Europe.By now,the band had
  adventured into pop genres beyond rock,yet colouring their songs
  with their distinctive style of interpretation and playing.Here
  we find the gorgeous ballad ONE YEAR OF LOVE and the catchy
  FRIENDS WILL BE FRIENDS.The ominous anthem WHO WANTS TO LIVE
  FOREVER and the Highlander themed PRINCES OF THE UNIVERSE are
  gems in this crown.The first two USA singles, the rocker ONE

  cracked the US Top 40 in a decade when alternative music was

  <Text category="music">Another great album by Firehouse. My
  favorites are Reach for the sky, When I look into your eyes, and
  hold your fire. I have other favorites, but there are my top 3. I
  have a story to go along with this album, ladies and gentlemen.
  See, I was heading to Cross-Country one day, for the huge "Group
  2" meet. (There's a section, and 5 groups from every section make
  it, and there were four sections, so you can make the
  calculations). I listened to this album, having a bad day before,
  and having a bad night of rest. Listening to this album, I got a
  river of positivity, and I had a great start and a great finish.
  I ended up smashing my last personal best in Cross-Country.
  Basically ladies and gentlemen, this cd has alot of effect. Get
  it. I love to review things. Have a great day</Text>
  <Text category="music">The Dead were primarily a live road band,
  but on this and the other great album from 1970 (American
  Beauty)the band proved their mettle in the studio, moving into
  less spacey territory. The music reflects their range, from
  country and bluegrass to folk, blues and rock. Superb. ps. their
  early studio effortsAnthem..., Aoxomoxoa) were also noteworthy
  experiments, but the music wasn't as powerful as the live

  <Text category="music">Sing of Mary is a work of art! The beauty

  <Text category="music">but not the only one you should get. Make
  this a purchase, but get live/dead also because it has all
  different songs, and then look at other live releases. The dead
  have a lot of good recordings, just pick and choose among them.
  This one has become a staple of great dead songs in my
  collection. It is amazing how many good songs they have, and how
  intimidating it seems to get their best stuff, but you can't go
  wrong with this release even though some people feel it isn't up

  Goldsboro, Glenn Campbell, O.C. Smith, Otis Reading, Pat Boone,

  <Text category="music">I got the LP version of this album as a
  Christmas present in 1988. I immediately fell in love with it.
  She sings about issues such as unemployment and poverty which
  were rampant during the Reagan years ("Talkin about a
  Revolution", "Fast Car"). But she offered hope that things would
  get better as we approached the 90s, which they did. "Mountains O
  Things" was about the materialsim of the 80s. Other issues she
  covers are racism ("Across the Lines") and domestic abuse
  ("Behind the Wall"). Even though this album is almost 20 years
  old it does not sound dated, as the messages are just as relavent
  today as they were in 1988. I bought the CD version in 1992 and I
  never get tired of listening to it. All of the songs are good but
  my favorite ones are "Talking about a Revolution", "Fast Car",
  "Baby Can I Hold You", "Mountains of Things", "Why" and "For My
  Lover".</Text>
  <Text category="music">This is the type of music to sit down,
  relax, put on a pair of headphones and let it absorb your
  concious. From spacey sounding electronics to soft vocals over

  is just a taste of what is Supersilent, and from what I hear it
  is all improvised which blows my head clean off. All this coming
  from someone who has never heard them before...talk about a great
  buy! Highly, highly recommended, I close my eyes, to awaken among
  the cosmos traveling without a tangible body, drunk with the
  infinite beauty, I sigh without a mouth and think..</Text>
  <Text category="music">Really, this is only worth 4 stars if you
  can appreciate all things cheesy. This is, of course, funny
  stuff. Really, it's the kind of music where you don't want other
  people to know you're listening to it, but oh my is it fun! This
  one has all the ingredients of your typical yngwie-inspired power
  metal-album: soaring guitars, high-pitched vocals, double-bass
  drumming, a lot of neoclassical stuff (essentially the sound of
  Mozart, Bach and Beethoven, just way less complex) both on the
  keyboards and the guitars. And of course, trumpets and brass. Oh,
  how I loathe and love the sound of trumpets and brass on a
  keyboard. Cheese, cheese, cheese all the way! If you've heard ANY
  rhapsody-material before, a song-by-song breakdown is pretty
  unnecessary as you'll know exactly what to expect. They really
  did benefit from the better production on their next album (not
  to mention their latest opus!) but Legendary Tales doesn't sound
  bad by any means, and the songwriting is solid and pretty
  diverse. It's just cheesy, REAL cheesy! And truth be told, since
  it's a metal album the guitars could use a little more 'oomph'
  here and there. This is more happy metal than heavy metal, but
  then again, they're singing about mystical lands and holy
  creatures, so Behemoth-like heavy guitars wouldn't really fit. We
  don't wanna scare our Warrior of Ice now, do we</Text>
  <Text category="music">There have been innumerable Motorhead
  collections over the years, but this is one of the few that
  attempts to mix old with the new. On this collection, all the
  classics are present, and some newer material is thrown in as
  well. Unfortunately, there are some throw-away tracks, mainly the
  Girlscool and Headgirl tracks. (To be honest, these tracks are
  pretty much worthless.) Some live tracks are meshed in and fit
  well, and the newer songs help to add some variety to the
  old-scool stuff. I would recommend this collection to listeners
  looking to get a nice, cheap collection of some of Motorhead's
  best just for the sake of getting into the band. But if you're
  wanting the prime collection of older material, save up some
  extra dough and buy "No Remorse" or "Stone Deaf Forever.</Text>
  <Text category="music">Aretha's voice, her style, delivery and
  interpretation of her music is incomparable. These songs are more
  than just classics; they're a songbook to millions of people's
  lives who grew up listening to her in the 60's and 70's as I did.
  They evolk memories of times that changed our world, and showed
  just how powerful and influential music could be for generations
  to come. There is not much that came before, and very little that
  came after these golden years for Aretha, that can compare to
  this treasury of her music. Sadly the Aretha Frankiln of 2007
  pales in comparison to the Aretha Franklin of this time, who was
  truly and rightfully The Queen of Soul.</Text>
  <Text category="music">This 1989 debut album from this Texas
  sleaze metal outfit is chocked full of great vocals from Jason
  McMaster,catchy guitar riffs,and generally a collection of feel
  good tunes about getting drunk and having a good time.It fits
  quite nicely in my CD collection in the " D" column next to the
  Dirty Looks CD.I thought "Scared" was the best song on here along
  with the opener,"Teasin Pleasin" and "Queen of the Nile" but I
  liked all of them.The best way to describe Dangerous Toys is that
  it has a heavy Guns N Roses sound with a poppier edge to it.It's
  too bad they never made a good album after this one and Dangerous
  Toys would never get to this level again.If you want late 80's
  hard rock/metal without the spandex and the makeup,this debut
  album is highly recommended.Nothing fancy,just good old fashioned
  rock and roll</Text>

  <Text category="music">This CD is well worth buying. But to you
  blues aficionado's who rely on Shaq's recommendations, let me put
  it in terms you'll understand. Coco is no SRV, or an Albert, or a
  Buddy. He's definitely a large step below them. But he is also
  not a lounge singer type like Smokin Joe Kubek, Lil Ed and the
  Blue Imperials, etc. Coco, is a large step above them. This CD
  seems to pick up steam with each song. He shows his flexibility
  with different types of guitar playing on a number of songs. He
  performs a great ballad, with a Johnny Copeland, song (#6),
  that's 5 minutes and 59 seconds long. (I could have said 6
  minutes, but Shaq don't fool around when it comes to da blues!)

  the local shopping center indulging in - er - various activities.
  Half of the bands on this CD I had the privilege of seeing
  perform live in the 70s. THIS is what FM radio sounded like back
  then. Every single song on this CD was well known to me and my
  friends. Yes, even Black Oak Arkansas (hot and nasty!), Nazareth
  (get Hair of the Dog CD for more), and the Runaways (hot babes!).

  <Text category="music">Since Sunset Boulevard is one of my
  favorite films, I bought the London cast album long before the
  musical came to America. Patti LaPone is the ultimate Broadway
  star, having created the role of Evita. Her soaring versions of
  "As If We Never Said Goodbye", and "With One Look" are unmatched.
  Her power and vocal range soar! All of Norma's songs had to be
  drastically reduced in vocal range to accomodate Glen Close's
  lack of, (or nonexistent) singing ability. In fact, this DVD was
  unavailabe to the American market during the American run of the
  musical and was literally pulled from the shelves. Perhaps ALW
  didn't want the American audience to hear the masterwork of this
  production. Kevin Anderson, a brilliant actor, does not have the
  operatic quality of Alan Cambell in the U.S. cast, but he
  portrayed Joe Gillis with far more guts and passion. This is not
  for the lover's of Oklahoma of Showboat, but for lovers of more
  contemporary musicals, this one is perfect</Text>

  <Text category="music">this album was by far the bands most
  daring ablum. they went away from the classic INXS sound that
  made them superstars (Kick, X) and instead updated their sound to
  fit the time. like a previous reviewer noted, this was when
  grunge was becoming very popular in the US, and unfortunately,
  caused this album to go unnoticed for the most part. its sad too,
  cuz there are many solid tracks, inlcuding Heaven Sent (my
  favorite), Not Enough Time, Baby Dont Cry and Beautiful Girl. I
  have recently become a big fan of INXS and have purchased all of
  their albums. I like this one in particular because it is
  different from all their other albums. I recommend "Welcome" to
  any INXS fan and any other fan of great music</Text>
  <Text category="music">This is a great CD! Each track fades up to
  full volume at the start and fades down to silence at the end.
  This makes it nice to just play the entire CD or to loop one
  track since there are no sharp changes from one noise to another.
  So far the Car and Washing machine tracks seem to be our baby's
  favorites. When she outgrows the need for this white noise CD,
  we'll transition her to lullaby or classical music. For now
  though, this CD helps us keep her on a schedule and well rested
  by helping keep her relaxed and usually asleep during her nap
  times. As a bonus, the Waves and Rain on the Roof tracks are
  soothing for grown-ups needing to drown out noise while they
  sleep</Text>
  <Text category="music">As a band, The Byrds are one of the
  greatest and certainly one of the most influential bands in rock
  and roll history. Adding to that legacy, "Mr. Tamborine Man's"
  status as one of the greatest debut albums in rock history is
  almost without question. This band could do it all; country,
  folk, rock, jam, psychedelica, etc, etc. And this debut was
  perhaps the pinnacle of their achievements. Though they would
  venture into much more adventurous territory ("Notorious Byrd
  Brothers"), this was where the band was the most solid, the most
  tight collectively. Dylan's influence is everywhere from the
  get-go; 4 of his songs span the album, including the title track
  which the Byrd's turned into his only #1 hit. Elsewhere, there
  are two other covers, but the songs with the best longevity are
  originals, mostly penned by Gene Clark. Witness the tortured
  romance of "I'll Feel a Whole lot Better" and "Here Without You"
  and tell me he wasn't a great songwriter. Roger McGuinn (or Jim,
  if you like) was quick about finding his signature nasally croon
  that would go on to influence Tom Petty, among others. Obviously,
  not everyone had found their place; songs by Chris Hillman and
  David Crosby are nowhere to be found. But "Mr. Tamborine Man"
  stand today every bit as tall as the early works of Dylan and the
  Beatles. This is the album that set the standard for folk-rock
  from then on, from Buffalo Springfield to REM to Toad the Wet
  Sprocket to the most current emo bands. Overall: 10 out of
  10</Text>
  <Text category="music">While Volume 1 of the DREAM BABES series
  is more accessible with its very girly girl group pop, sun-shiney
  vocals - Volume 2 offers a little bit of everything - from pop
  r&amp;amp;b, girl group vocals, pop, swinging pop &amp;amp; even
  some very early school grrl rock 'n roll - they might be a little
  more lyrically serious (hence the subtitle REFLECTIONS) but if
  anything, that's a good thing. It's nice to hear that women were
  trying different styles and genres and not just singing about
  about boys ... And also know - these are not just timepieces to
  be admired from a distant - these are all still fun, interesting
  and downright cool to hear again or for the first time. If you're

  <Text category="music">What can be said about this album? This is
  one of those albums that re-invigorates your faith/enthusiasm in
  music (those who listen to a lot of albums know what I mean).
  Some tracks from here were most famously covered by Nirvana on
  their unplugged album, although pained I don't think Cobain quite
  got the feel that Kirkwood gives to these songs. It has a perfect
  blend of songs that make you want to almost hoe-down and those
  that you can just reflect on and chill out. Particular stand outs
  on this album are Split Myself In Two, Magic Toy Missing, Aurora
  Borealis and The Whistling Song. This album does take some
  growing as Kirkwood's voice is abrasive, but this is an album
  that will truly make you love music. Do try it, you won't be
  disappointed.</Text>
  <Text category="music">This is a wondrful CD and quite a bargin.
  Two discs and the very best of Nancy Wilson. I liked so much, I
  bought two and gave one to a friend</Text>
  <Text category="music">I remember listning to this album over and
  over again when I was young. To this day I still can't get these
  awesome songs out of my head! A must get album for you Old School
  folks or anyone that enjoys great music</Text>
  <Text category="music">very interesting CD. Some of the vocals

  I said, think Syd Barrett's Floyd mixed w/ Melt Bannana. I highly

  <Text category="music">Pablo is definitely the Babe Ruth/Moses of
  these pieces. However, tempo, cadence, clarity, consistency and
  emotional projection are much better here. Starker is at least
  the Michael Jordan of the Bach Suites. -And compared to Pablo (I
  heard the Naxos one) the sound quality on this disc is The Right
  Hand Of God. Starker is the dog's balls; big ones, like a Great
  Dane.</Text>
  <Text category="music">As always, opinions vary in terms of who
  is the master at recording timeless pieces of music such as these
  Bach cello suites. Starker himself pronounced in the sleeves of
  this CD that this edition, the 4th recordings of these music by
  himself is not "technically perfect", but in many ways, his most
  mature interpretation. You can spend hundreds trying to find a
  Mercury copy of "the perfect" rendition; or you can appreciate
  the little imperfections of an aged artist, at the height of his
  humanistic understanding of music, and of life.</Text>
  <Text category="music">This is a wonderful Vangelis album and is
  fairly energetic, with enough experimental flourishes to keep the
  listener fully engaged. Released in 1975, Heaven and Hell
  incorporates a full choir into the Vangelis sound. Vangelis
  played all of the instruments on this album including
  synthesizers, electric piano, acoustic piano, a full drum kit,
  and percussion. Vangelis is joined by the English Chamber Choir
  (conducted by Guy Protheroe) with Vana Veroutis as the lead
  female vocal, in addition to Jon Anderson (vocals/lyrics on
  Heaven and Hell (Part 1 So Long Ago, So Clear). Vangelis is quite
  a good musician and really shines on the acoustic piano. As a
  huge Yes fan, I was delighted to hear Jon's excellent voice and
  cosmic lyrics. As far as the inclusion of the choir goes, I did
  not mind it that much and felt that it added a very interesting
  textural element to the recording. The Heaven and Hell suite is
  divided into two lengthy movements including Part I (21'58") and
  Part II (21'16"). In general, the first part is more orchestral
  in nature and features the choir and excellent acoustic piano
  playing by Vangelis. Another general observation is that the
  first movement mixes vigorous sections that feature drums with
  spacey and haunting synth-dominated passages. Of course, my
  favorite part comes at the end of Part I, which is the 4'58"
  section with Jon on vocals. This short "song" is quite moving and
  uplifting. Movement II is a little darker and more experimental
  than the first movement and is my favorite of the two. The choir
  is featured on the second movement, along with a beautiful
  wordless vocal by the very talented Vana Veroutis. Part II closes
  with a very spacey and quiet synthesizer section, which provides
  excellent contrast with the preceding thunderous percussion
  section. All in all, this is a good Vangelis album and is
  recommended along with Albedo 0.39 (1976); Spiral (1977); and the
  excellent Opera Sauvage (1979)</Text>
  <Text category="music">Coming from a listener with a broad scope
  of musical preferences, Blues has always been a multi-faceted
  genre which can be broken down into the categories:Soulful Blues,
  Drinking Blues and Guitar Blues. "B.B King - Live At The Regal"
  is one of those recordings that just happens to capture all
  three. This recording is dear to my heart as I can remember far
  back as first or second grade when my grandmother (God Bless)
  used to play this on 8-track. She used to love herself some Riley
  "Blues Brother" King. This recording ALWAYS seemed to be in the
  player when my cousins and I would come over to visit and rest
  assured, You WILL hear it before you left to go home. At that
  time, Being the young naive kid that I was, I remember saying
  that I hated it and that it was old folks music. All grown up
  now, In an age where real music is practically unheard of in
  terms of what these young artists of today release on CDs, I have
  a newfound respect for real stuff like this. So instead of
  sitting around burning your brain cells trying to understand what
  this new generation is calling itself creating, You have decided
  to come to one of the first sources for good old fasioned real
  music....The Blues. In my opinion, "BB King Live At The Regal" is
  one of Mr. King's best recordings and with myself not being a big
  fan of live albums, This is one of those rare live pieces that
  captures the essence of what a live recording should sound like.
  Maybe not so much in terms of the musicianship but the overall
  performance of those involved. The arrangements were put together
  nicely &amp;amp; the musicians were all in a very tight vibe on
  this album and whoever was on the mixing board did an excellent
  job of capturing this essence. BB's pickin' and crooning mixed
  with the superb playing by the band make this a wonderful place
  to start for the blues or BB King enthusiast. It sounds as if it
  was made in a tasteful nightclub full of grown people who wanted
  to hear good music while having a good time. The ladies were
  screaming and the gentlemen were cheering and BB was playing at
  his best. The only gripe I have about this disc is that it is
  very short; which was typical considering the age and time that
  it was made but still essential and a solid lesson for anyone
  interested in Blues (especially Blues Guitar). I recommend
  getting this and BB's "Live In Cook County Jail". They both are
  live albums and both have some of the same songs on them but they
  were done in a different way and should still be heard. Good
  choice if you get this one.</Text>
  <Text category="music">Nobody captures the spirit and essence of
  a city at night like New York City's own Ultrablue. The group is
  the brainchild of keyboardist/producer John Smatla and jazz
  guitarist Dave Stryker, who bring in an NYC all-star cast of
  players in addition to their impressive band ensemble to create a
  sophisticated and evocative musical mood. ULTRABLUE is the latest
  outing for Ultrablue, and the first release on 215 Records. The
  project drips of chill, smooth jazz, and rich, rhythmic textures
  that will keep the project in replay mode for a good while in
  your car and home players and on your iPod. Special guests
  include singer/saxophonist Pete Belasco, trumpet/flugelhorn
  player Randy Brecker, female vocal group, Allure, flutist Nestor
  Torres and Brazilian vocalist Gabriella Anders. From the sexy
  saunter, "Guilty Pleasures" and the spicy and sultry,
  "Indiscretions," to the scintillating "Soul Candy," ULTRABLUE
  provides such a cool groove and flow that it really does lend
  itself to be the perfect soundtrack to a night out or in (for
  that matter). Pete Belasco is featured on the sensual cover "The
  Summer Knows" while Nestor Torres livens things up on the groove,
  "Jungle Fever," and the delicious Gabriela Anders delivers an
  alluring vocal on "Destiny." The project's first single,
  "Shiver," is already attracting radio airplay from coast to
  coast... We expect big things from Ultrablue on this and all of
  their future releases. This is the new standard of Smooth Jazz.

  immediatly knew it was going to rock! After hearing the title

  Spice Girls Cds. It is better. My favorite songs are Never Be The
  Same Again,Ga Ga,and Goin Down.</Text>
  <Text category="music">I have listened to the cuts from this CD
  and was amazed at how quickly it transported me back to the time.
  There were several tracks that I was delighted to see since the
  artists were not popular enough to have an entire album

  this is the set for you!</Text>
  <Text category="music">Studio album released in 1971, by the
  original band-a real band with Alice Cooper, Neal Smith, Dennis
  Dunaway, Michael Bruce, and Glen Buxton. I think the other band
  members (apart from Cooper), got the short end of the stick. This
  album, along with these 'Love it to death', 'Billion dollar
  babies', and 'Love it to death' are so vastly superior to 'his'
  other albums. The band plays and writes really well together as a
  'real' band. Case in point, listen to 'Dada' from a few years
  later-dreadful! Just wish he had kept a proper band together,
  even if he fealt that they were not as musically good as some of
  the late session musicians. Rock is about feel, more than
  technique in my opinion. I can't even listen to 'Dada' or</Text>
  <Text category="music">I'm not sure about all that other nonsense
  the reviewer before me is talking about (sounds like someone with
  an axe to grind)but this album is a stunning piece of
  workmanship. The music is inspired, the melodies transcending,
  and the emotion - deep and meaningful. As far as "copying Yanni"
  goes, well - I don't agree, in fact, Yanni is far more generic
  and less inspired. The sound samples the cranky reviewer alludes
  to are in fact NOT the same nor, are they Yanni's creation. I
  write this review to commend mr farish on his work, and to take
  to task the idiot who misinformed others and couldn't resist his
  own urge to see his "critique" in print. Ryans music is
  distinctly his own, no question - and any similarities are tonal,
  and not compositional - which the reveiwer would be well advised
  to take note of. As far as I'm concerned, you be the judge - and
  let cranky wannabe music critics continue to wallow in their own
  self hate as they surf store shelve's and websites for music to
  criticize - and well, make themselves feel a little better.
  Personally, I would recommend this album to anyone who likes
  strong songs with great production and uplifting energy. All the
  other stuff is for hacks! enjoy this music! I do.</Text>
  <Text category="music">An outstanding compilation of a wide
  variety of popular and regional styles from across Mexico. This

  boleros, indie rock and various stylistic fusions are
  represented, and even a few sones from Veracruz -- one of my

  shows between 1973-75.Absolute best cut here is "Where Have All
  The Flowers Gone?" along with "6/8 Tune",that are the disc's only
  unreleased material.Other cosmic gems include "Dynamite/I Am Your

  <Text category="music">This CD reminds me once again why Russian
  liturgical music is one of the treasures of the world: beautiful,
  profound, awe-inspiring, uplifting. For the most part, the pieces
  are well chosen and the performances excellent. I am delighted to
  see that many of the tracks are from the classic recording of the
  Rachmaninoff Vespers made in the early 1970s by the USSR Ministry
  of Culture Chamber Choir directed by Valery Polyansky, and
  released in the USA by Angel-Melodiya. I wore out my copy of the
  LP years ago; although it has been reissued on CD, it's out of
  print and very hard to find. So it is wonderful to see a generous
  selection from that recording available on this disk. Listen to
  track 11, "Praise the Lord O My Soul", sung by the chamber choir
  and mezzo Irina Arkhipova. You would have to have a heart of
  stone not to be moved as she sings "Slava Ghospidin" (Praise to
  the Lord). And listen to how the basses descend to B-flat at end.

  where I live) who are very keen on this album? At this stage
  though, it is only the very wealthy that can afford it.</Text>
  <Text category="music">This is the first cd I've bought in the
  Liquid Mind series, but after hearing this one, I'll buy more.
  The music is calming and soothing; great to fall asleep by which
  I often do. It lulls you into a peaceful state of relaxation,
  letting your mind drift away from the cares of the day. It makes
  me think of floating on a cloud. I would highly recommend this cd
  for anyone with a busy, stressed-out life.</Text>
  <Text category="music">Superior to the first Steppenwolf album in
  many ways, and including a song that tops even 'Born To Be Wild'
  itself, 'Magic Carpet Ride', is as essential as the group's first
  album, even to the casual rock fan. It opens with 'Faster Than
  The Speed Of Life', a perfect blend of Steppenwolfish hard rock
  &amp;amp; Airplanesque psychedelic rock (like 'She Has Funny
  Cars'). 'Tighten Up Your Wing' is an upbeat, bluesy track, that
  bounces well along, before being replaced with 'None Of Your
  Doing', a Steppenwolf-classic, that shifts gear between verse
  &amp;amp; chorus. 'Spiritual Fantasy' is one of the strangest
  creations on the album, strangely touching, though appaling at
  first. But given a second chance, it comes across as one of the
  best tracks on the album. The marihuana-anthem 'Don't Step On The
  Grass, Sam' is pure heavy Steppenwolf, a timeless classic, that
  crunches slowly, but steadily along. '28' is a great rock song
  with just a hint of psychedelia in the melody. A neat little
  rocker that is followed by the ultimate psychedelic dance track.
  'Magic Carpet Ride' is simply Steppenwolf's best song ever, a
  fantastic blend of rhytm, melody &amp;amp; vision, that is worth
  the price of all Steppenwolf's classic albums on its own. It was
  also the only of their singles to almost replicate 'Born To Be
  Wild's US #2 placing, when it shot to #3 on the US chart.
  'Disappointment Number' is almost that, but then not again. It is
  an odd ode to/parody of old blues, complete with bird sounds in
  the background, as if it's an old blues singer sitting out in the
  open. 'Lost And Found By Trial And Error' has a great tune, and
  rocks away well, as does 'Hodge, Podge, Strained Through A
  Leslie' and 'Resurrection'. Both employ the classic Steppenwolf
  sound in a great rocking way, to become, if not classics, then at
  least Steppenwolf-standards. The album closes with 'Reflections'
  a weird song, that seems like somebody trying to be visionary,
  before you realize that that is just what he is. Just in a very
  peculiar way. The album has some, if not weak, then not too
  powerful spots, but generally it is a more than worthy follow-up
  to the first Steppenwolf album, with a great blend of the band's
  traditional hard rock and a form of psychedelia that suits them
  perfectly. Even the least interesting tracks rock nicely,
  &amp;amp; no-one should have anything to complain about
  here..</Text>
  <Text category="music">With all the 'Neuvo Flamenco' and its
  accompaning popularity. It is nice (and a relief) I might add, to
  hear the flamenco guitar in its purist form. Not only does this

  rare perfomances by Manolo de Huelva. Which are difficult to find

  <Text category="music">I discovered Seal the same way that most
  people did: through his utterly beautiful song "Kiss From A
  Rose". I heard it on the radio one day, and played it constantly
  for months after that until I finally decided to purchase the
  album the song was from. As it happens, the song is from Seal's
  most revered album, his multi-platinum 1994 self-titled album.
  (This is not to be confused with his other self-titled album, his
  debut, released in 1991.) I didn't know what to expect when I
  bought the album, having heard only one song from it, but months
  after purchasing it I'm glad I made the gamble. I think that the
  sub-genre which best classifies SEAL is urban. Urban music,
  according to All Music Guide, is smooth and polished, often
  romantic, sometimes uptempo and funky, and features soulful
  vocals. SEAL has all of this and more. It has techno beats, but
  they're not as overwhelming as one might expect. They blend
  together with peaceful, occasionally ethereal guitars and Seal's
  incredibly soothing singing. This is, no doubt, stylish music,
  but first and foremost it's a collection of warm, encouraging
  songs penned by a very talented musician. There's nothing that
  comes close to being a bad song here; there's not even a slightly
  weak composition. Thus it's a little harder to pick highlights
  than usual. Some highlights include the strong opening track,
  "Bring It On"; the emotional hit "Prayer For The Dying"; the
  shimmering "Dreaming In Metaphors"; the upbeat "Newborn Friend";
  and, needless to say, the absolutely wonderful "Kiss From A
  Rose". The closing track, "Bring It On (Reprise)" is another
  beautiful song, but "Kiss From A Rose" is possibly the most
  lovely song I've ever heard. Listening to it in the warmth of
  one's home during a snowy December afternoon is an incredibly
  powerful experience. The message of the album, if there is one,
  is "Keep on going - life is beautiful!" It could fail under any
  other popular artist, but Seal succeeds marvelously. This is some
  of the most heartfelt, inspirational singing I've ever heard.
  There's a delightful optimism in Seal's singing that sounds
  strong rather than naiive. It's hard to feel down after listening
  to such an uplifting album as this. Seal is certainly one of the
  most talented musicians of R&amp;amp;B (or rock - you decide).
  These songs have clear, strong messages, warm, inspirational
  lyrics, heartfelt, soothing singing, danceable beats, and a whole
  lot of emotion. Once you've heard "Kiss From A Rose", I guarantee
  you'll want to pick up the album. If you're already thinking of
  doing so, then I encourage you to go forward and buy it; you
  won't regret it. It's become one of my favorite albums. When
  you're feeling disillusioned or depressed with the state of your
  life or just life in general, look no further than SEAL to make
  you cherish it once again.</Text>
  <Text category="music">They may have a new name, but their sound
  remains the same as before. Mixed with club-friendly beats and
  laid back drunken-style, the Liks have crafted the perfect party
  CD. Tracks like &amp;amp;quot;Run Wild&amp;amp;quot; (possibly
  the best track on the CD, certainly the most fun to listen to),
  &amp;amp;quot;Sickness&amp;amp;quot; (with Butch Cassidy
  providing some very tight vocals on he hook), and the
  Neptunes-produced &amp;amp;quot;Best U Can&amp;amp;quot; showcase
  The Liks' party appeal, while head-nodders like
  &amp;amp;quot;Bully Foot&amp;amp;quot; (with Busta Rhymes) and
  &amp;amp;quot;Another Round&amp;amp;quot; create a more relaxed
  vibe for the listener. The Liks also get outside help from
  artists like fellow Likwit-Crewmember Defari (&amp;amp;quot;My
  Dear&amp;amp;quot;) and Kurupt (the cleverly-titled
  &amp;amp;quot;Promote Violins&amp;amp;quot;). Of course, Xzibit
  holds it down on his two tracks, &amp;amp;quot;Bar
  Code&amp;amp;quot; and &amp;amp;quot;151&amp;amp;quot;. The only
  way this Cd differs from their last releases is the instruments,
  varying from violins (&amp;amp;quot;Promote
  Violins&amp;amp;quot;), trumpets
  (&amp;amp;quot;L-I-K-S&amp;amp;quot;), and even 40 ounce bottles
  (&amp;amp;quot;40 oz. Quartet&amp;amp;quot; skits). The thing you
  shouldn't expect to find is deep lyrics or dark productions (go
  grab Mobb Deep). However, copping &amp;amp;quot;X.O.

  guitar players in gypsy jazz - he is also one of the most
  creative. On this album, he gives us a new take on Django's music
  that is simply stunning. "Move" has a smaller, more focused sound
  that it's predecessors, and the addition of the saxophone brings
  a really fresh twist to this great old music. Bireli is one of
  the hottest jazzmen around - this disc is all the evidence you'll

  <Text category="music">What's more to say about what may be the
  best "rock" album ever (especially if you consider the "My
  Kingdom" EP to be the second disc in a two disc set)? The most
  emotionally wide-ranging album from one of the best bands ever.
  Who else has ever made music like FSOL? The Beatles and
  Fripp&amp;amp;Crimson are the only possible contenders. I've
  never heard anything that does a better job of juxtaposing the
  terrifying and the unbearably beautiful. If I could pinpoint the
  one disinguishing feature of all FSOL/AA releases, it would be
  (as a line in "The Isness" goes) "...[a longing for]
  inexhaustible ecstasy." It's all the more poignant on this album
  because of its being interwoven with themes of terror, paranoia
  and a sense of unrecoverable loss of something without which life
  isn't worth living. It sounds hokey, but just opening up the
  booklet while listening to "Her Face Forms in Summertime" and
  reading the scrawled message "things are getting f*&amp;amp;ked
  up round here" makes my eyes a little watery. My CD developed a 2
  second glitch and I just ordered another one--this is so
  incredible that nothing less than perfection will do. Just a few
  points of note: if you're wondering why you spent all that money
  on your two channel stereo and you haven't heard this album yet,
  pick it up and turn it up. I've heard recordings with more bottom
  end and slam, but none with more depth, nuance and musicality.
  I've also found that one of the true tests of a Masterpiece is
  whether it's possible to really enjoy listening to anything else
  after its over. Play Coltrane's "Ascension," Beethoven's String
  Quartet in A Minor Op. 132, or Bruckner's Ninth and see what I
  mean. I played Dead Cities last night and everything to which I
  tried to listen sounded hopelessly trivial afterwards. In the
  early 80s, a lot of my friends used to speak of The Clash as "the
  only band that mattered." At the time, I didn't think any band
  had mattered all that much since '72. To my now-much-older ears,
  FSOL fits that description more accurately than any band to the
  last 35 years, and this is probably their best work (every single
  one of them is a desert island disc, however). One of the very
  few utterly timeless classics of modern music, and a record that
  belongs in the collection of anyone with ears.</Text>

  <Text category="music">a lot of people seem to snub their noses
  at Let's Talk About Love because it wasn't the career-defining
  album as the album that preceded it, but all in all, it's still a
  fantastic snapshot for Celine's career in 1997. Celine shocked
  almost everyone by releasing a follow-up so shortly (Falling Into
  You was still in the top 40 on the charts at the time) but it was
  very worthy. Among my faves on the album include "The Reason",
  "Immortality" with The Bee Gees (for a "Celine-less" version of
  the song, check out The Bee Gees' 2-disc hits collection from
  2001), "Love Is On The Way", the very funky "Treat Her Like A
  Lady", "To Love You More" and the beautiful singalong title
  track. This album also housed "My Heart Will Go On" which
  certainly helped push this album to sales over 9 million. While
  it was a song that you wanted to smash the stereo at the time
  because it was being played every five minutes, I'd say enough
  time has passed that once again you can enjoy and appreciate this
  beautiful, powerful ballad. With "Falling Into You" and this
  album, Celine was the #1 female artist for a period, becoming a
  superstar right as Mariah was abandoning AC for r&amp;amp;b, as
  Alanis was going on hiatus for awhile, and when Shania was taking
  off but hadn't yet exploded into major-superstardom. Love her or
  malign her (it seems fashionable to do the latter), she became
  one of the premier voices in Adult Contemporary and won over a
  large audience. I haven't been a fan at all of her last few
  albums, but if she ever comes back with an album like these two,
  I'd snatch it up in a heartbeat</Text>
  <Text category="music">This album grabbed my attention from the
  first measure. Thick and heavy, this is not like any blues album
  I've ever heard. Very atypical for Hidalgo as well. This one is
  probably an acquired taste- one for the truly hard core blues
  fan. The sheer uniqueness grabbed me from the start, and the more
  I listen to it, the more I like it. I can only hope there's a
  Houndog 2 in the works..</Text>
  <Text category="music">I heard The Chairman Dances and went right
  to Amazon to order this. This ia a lovely little gem of a CD, and
  it is so pleasing to find John Adams, another great modern
  American composer. I'm also a fan of composers such as
  Christopher Rouse, for example, and Joe Leniado Chira is my
  cousin. Modern composers are a precious resource that we should
  explore, demand more of and nurture. We afficianados would like
  to see symphony orchestras and ensembles giving more attention to
  the modern genre. Meanwhile, John Adams has impressed me with
  this disc. The Chairman Dances is my favorite. I can just see
  Chairman Mao doing a vigorous foxtrot to this, and Tricky Dick
  feeling jealous. This might be the music that opened China to the
  West</Text>
  <Text category="music">although each track is beautiful in it's
  own way, it's their sum that makes this such an incredible album
  in my mind. where felt mountain remained rather mellow and
  etheral thruought the entire album, black cherry offers more in
  the way of diverse melodies and tempo. the tracks seem to be
  placed specifically in a way that makes the album feel like a
  journey, and, personally, like a lay's potato chip, not able to
  listen to just one....yeah, i need the whole thing..</Text>
  <Text category="music">MY HUSBAND AND I PLAY THIS CD ALL THE
  TIME. WE BOTH LOVE IT</Text>
  <Text category="music">Listen, did I hear someone say "lack of
  energy?" Get this album, as my lovely wife did for me last
  Christmas, from Amazon, BTW, and listen to this lineup: Fire
  &amp;amp; Water, Mr. Big, I'm A Mover, Woman, All Right Now, Oh I
  Wept, Stealer, Walk in My Shadow... Oh, get up off the floor,
  amigo... see, it's you that's having a lack of energy... I know,
  this music is like a workout, emotionally, aurally, and in the
  old pleasure zone too. Rodgers &amp;amp; the late great Paul
  Kossoff surely knew how to sell a song, didn't they? Perhaps
  these fellows were near the best, not only at the time, but in
  any century of Rock/blues/git-down-kick in-the-mud blooz music.

  <Text category="music">I have been a fan for Jaci Velasquez for
  the past eight years and enjoy hearing her voice in both
  languages. I do not speak Spanish but enjoy her artistic
  abilities none the less. This album lived up to the Velasquez
  name in my book- My family and I only really enjoy the
  traditional sounding Christmas carols and tend to not enjoy the
  revised versions. Jaci's album not only made sure the carols were
  sung traditionally but she has given us a gift a couple new songs
  that will be added to my Christmas traditions! Overall I LOVE
  this album and the only reason I did not give it a full five
  stars was that I am done with that Chipmunk Song. Sorry
  everybody.</Text>
  <Text category="music">I think his debut had the best lyrics.
  This joint gets off to a good start with We Still Party and
  pretty much bangs till the end. His production on here is best
  described as "Late 90's Roger Troutman-esque G-Funk". Geust Stars
  like 2nd II NOne, AMG, Suga Free and El Debarge get their shine
  on. Top Joints: We Still Party (Peter Gunz and Quik on the track)
  Quik jacks the VERB song from School House Rock. (The Jam) So
  Many Wayz Hand In Hand You'z A Ganxta (Quik refutes rumors that
  he was involved in Biggie's demise. Also denounces reference to
  death in rap songs.) I Useta Know Her (Should be called I Useta

  it. Just get it</Text>
  <Text category="music">For those who have watched the movie Jaws
  (ask yourself, who hasn't) will know that one of many key
  elements that made the movie a huge success was the fantastic
  score John Williams did for it. This cd captures all the music
  from the movie perfectly, with some new elements thrown in that
  are not found in the film. The linear notes are bright and
  colourful and provide some interesting information, which gives
  the overall package a nice touch. The overall cd package is
  certainly not a rushed effort and is worth every cent. A highly
  recommended purchase for those who love their soundtracks or
  anyone who wants to relive the film through the music</Text>
  <Text category="music">I have just purchased this CD (the day it
  came out!) and from what I've heard, it is amazing, surpassing
  (but not replacing) Boulez's earlier recording. If you are a fan

  must get</Text>
  <Text category="music">Their 4th album as a complete group (not
  counting the few album Havoc &amp;amp; Prode'je put out) is my
  least favorite of the 4 SCC albums I have (I don't have the one
  from 1992 or 2005), but it still gets itself a 4 star rating. Out
  of the 13 songs on here none are vclassics or worth skipping; 4
  are ok and the other 9 are good. Like all their albums, guests
  are minimal and are on are on 2 of the 13 songs. Production is
  mostly handled by Prode'je (as with all their albums) he does get
  a little help from Robert "Fonksta" Bacon &amp;amp; Tomie Mundie.
  A good album to have for SCC fans but not their best work. #1 - 8

  <Text category="music">This CD provides a fantastic overview of
  Rypdal, who has been recording for ECM for 30+ years now. The
  tracks range from pieces with an &amp;amp;quot;electric
  Miles&amp;amp;quot; sound to an orchestrated track. While very
  diverse, the tracks work well together and are unified by his
  unique,atmospheric tone and excellent compositions. The infamous
  ECM sound quality is even better due to 24 bit mastering.
  Informative liner notes as well. Highly recommended</Text>
  <Text category="music">What has happened to the song "Lives in
  the balance" on this set? If you go to his website it sounds
  really great!!! On this set it sounds awfull!! It sounds as if he
  was in a really big hurry to get the song over with. The
  packaging if you could call it that is really lame. Foam dots for
  holders? What do you do when those fall off? I suppose you put
  the cd's in jewel cases or else they will get really scratched
  up. Not to mention it is missing some of his greatest work! True
  you do get alot of songs for the money but, there should have
  been more time planning this set out before actually producing
  it. If you own an I-pod I suggest you go to apples I-tunes web
  page and import the great songs this set is missing as well as
  the others you really like off of this set and you will probably
  have spent the same amount of money if not less</Text>
  <Text category="music">The Coltrane soundscapes that this CD is
  infused flies to the mountain and back again, that's the truth,
  but one troubling question for me remains; no matter how much I
  enjoy this fusion incarnation by masters (new &amp;amp; old) -
  Where in the world is Alan Holdsworth? If any fusion guitar
  player has the rightful title claim to the Coltrane moniker -
  it's Holdsworth. For years he's been building the bridge between
  the good old philosophies and the new world order. Including
  Holdsworth would have just been the jazziest thing to do.</Text>
  <Text category="music">It was my full belief that the next time
  we would hear from Buju Banton on an album would be on the now 2
  years anticipated `Rasta Got Soul' album. The album which has
  still yet to arrive (and may never) was said to be along Buju's
  best and might actually rival his seminal classic `Til Shiloh. He
  even tipped his hand 2 years ago by releasing the album's first
  single, the `magical' Magic City. So the world was waiting to see
  just how much Soul the album had. However. Between then and now
  Buju has been going through so many events that this album, Too
  Bad, almost seems like a smack in the face to his critics.
  Forever, it seems that he is still living in the `Boom Bye Bye
  Curse', and having some legal matters which prevented him
  traveling, he apparently has been angered by all the unwanted
  attention and the result is Too Bad. The album has a severe kick
  to it, it can actually sit not too far away from his `stablemate'
  Assassin's Infiltrate from `05, in terms of style. The attraction
  here is actually the subject of `confusion'. While we were
  waiting for a massive roots album to come down the pipe, Buju
  hasn't made a pure dancehall album in a very very long time.
  Thus, the DJ who was once the dancehall's main attraction
  stepping back into the fray isn't at all a bad thing. So fans who
  sit longing for the days of Stamina Daddy and Batty Rider are the
  one's who'll be happy and I can fit into that camp as well! But
  at the same time, Buju's concentration for the last decade or so
  has been the roots, so now it is there where he will ultimately
  excel. However, with the current trend in dancehall to revive
  older riddims, you may find yourself feeling like 1991 all over
  again. The best tune here is probably the hard hard `Til It Bend.
  Til it Bend is serious serious rudey dancehall. The song might
  sound like the rest to the untrained ear, but I guarantee that is
  the song most Jamaican will pull up, Til it Bend is nice! Also
  check the wicked wicked Nothing, Who Have It?, the ultra clever
  Better Day and the nice Hey Boy over the Petty Thief riddim.
  However, my second favorite song here I would have to say would
  be the combination Don &amp;amp; Dupes with underrated dancehall
  singer Pinchers who has been making a very very nice return to
  the scene recently, largely due to his connection with Madhouse
  head, Dave Kelly. Buju makes an attempt (for some reason) at the
  useless Wipeout riddim on Me &amp;amp; Unu and actually makes it
  work a little. Also check when things slow down on nice tunes
  such as Driver, which is easily one of the best tunes on the
  album. Overall, the thought alone, Buju doing another dancehall
  album may have some salivating and some wondering where the roots
  is, this one may appeal to both group of hardcore fans. While
  there is nothing here that I would call definitive roots reggae,
  this album has such an old school vibes to it that anyone who has
  ever been a fan of Buju's will find something they like. I would
  have like to have seen Buju have at least one Lenky riddim on the
  album, a Wayne Wonder combination (although Pinchers subs just
  fine) and definitely the massive song Beauty Queen from the Twice
  Again riddim would have fit just fine here, but nevertheless,
  what you do have: High quality dancehall from one of the greatest
  architects of that skill is just fine and Too Bad, over both what
  Beenie and Baby Cham have done, is the best pure dancehall album
  of 2006 to date, and a boomshot in the arm for the genre</Text>
  <Text category="music">I ordered mine from here (Amazon
  Marketplace) a couple weeks ago, and I'm a very happy camper.
  This is one of the best online purchases I've made in a long,
  long time! First of all, there are songs I've never heard before,
  so by owning this compilation, it helps me get to know the band's
  material, or Siobhan's own solo stuff much better. All the songs
  are very well-written and catchy. Thanks to my best friend, he
  drew me toward's SS's music back in the 90's with the "HORMONALLY
  YOURS" CD. SS's music was always something I pushed to the "back
  burner" because I didn't know what to make of it. But in the past
  2 years, I've focused on the new material from the "Shakespears
  Sister #3" album...and it blew me away! Siobhan is a true musical
  genius! "I DON'T CARE" seems to be a differnt version. It's much
  brighter &amp;amp; fresher-sounding than the album version. Wow!
  "HELLO (TURN YOUR RADIO ON) is my favorite "SS" song of all time
  &amp;amp; also appears to be a different version. Just hearing
  the first notes from it, my eyes got all teary. It's just the way
  I am, regarding this song. The Clock ticking at the end reminds
  me of a heartbeat or something. Dark songs like this draw me
  near. LOL The compilation is missing one song "BITTER PILL". I
  wanted &amp;amp; hoped for this song to be released on the CD,
  but unfortunately it didn't make it. Awwww! The liner notes
  booklet is packed with all lyrics, cool photos and a fine page of
  background regarding the recordings of their albums. Siobhan is
  one cool gal! I love the front &amp;amp; back artwork, for it is
  both amusing, colorful &amp;amp; dramatic. I'm a sucker for
  dramatic stuff like this. Hopefully, Siobhan will continue
  recording lots of new material, using the "Shakespears Sister"
  title. I despise the crap we hear on the radio nowadays.
  Hopefully now that SF has released this package, the music will
  get more airplay. I like the nostalgic aspect of music from a
  decade ago, because it reminds us of how the music industry used
  to be non-commercial and fun. Yes...it's too bad that Siobhan and
  Marcella broke up, because their 2 uniquely different voices
  complimented one another. There hasn't been a duo like them
  since! My Thoughts on the DVD... I love it! The first &amp;amp;
  only video clip I've ever seen from "SS" is "STAY". Totaly blew
  me away since the first time I saw it. I've always loved seeing
  Siobhan as "Death", in her starry crown &amp;amp; black "Glitzy"
  outfit. She makes the perfect female version of "Death". I could
  never understand the video until now, because I never had the
  chance to see the entire thing on TV. The other videos are
  equally great and draw me closer each time. I appreciate the
  "Chaptered" Menu for the videos. At least I know what's from
  where. The DVD was put together very well, and is packed with
  great stuff. Fortunately, my DVD player on the Computer and the
  TV can play this All-Region PAL DVD. I haven't experienced any
  difficulties (skipping tracks or anything). It all plays fine.

  <Text category="music">The previous review has a few inaccuracies
  I thought I'd correct. First off, the beats on all of
  Atmosphere's albums, including this one, are produced and created
  by Ant, not DJ Abilities. Ant does not perform live, and so Slug
  often used to perform with DJ Abilities (and others). This may
  change in the next album as Atmosphere now includes a band soon
  to tour, but it's extermely likely Ant will be included in the
  production. Slug has never been 1/3 of Atmosphere, he has and
  always will be the main driving force and only consistent member
  of the group. Even when Spawn was a member of Atmosphere, Slug
  was still clearly the leader and brains beyond the operation, as
  evidenced by the tracks on Overcast!, all of which were dominated
  by Slug. Yes, this album is quite different from the newer stuff,
  and represents a critical moment in Atmosphere's evolution. Of
  course, anyone can listen to it. Even those silly "fan boys."
  It's a ridiculous notion to suggest that because something has
  changed, people won't like earlier incantations of the same
  group. It's that elitist old school b.s. and it's annoying. Some
  may not like it, but most hip-hop fans will probably enjoy it.
  What makes this album so interesting is how raw it is, and, as
  Slug says in the liner notes, how it's representative of his
  transformation as an MC. Recorded between Overcast! and Lucy
  Ford, you can witness Slug move from being a whitty, well-versed
  thug to something deeper and more innovative. Both elements are
  present. "The Abusing of the Rib" is one of the more evolved
  tracks on the album, while "@ It Again" is about sleeping with
  all sorts of girls in the Twin Cities, including yours of course.
  Note that I say "evolved" not in the sense that one song is
  better than another, but rather more representative of Slug's
  later work (Lucy Ford). This album represents a critical moment
  in the history of what I believe is the best hip hop group
  (individual) out there. While it doesn't have the catchiest
  melodies (the beats are great, just not catchy), it has some
  amazing rhymes and showcases Slug's ability to flow quickly and
  rap prolifically. Check it out</Text>
  <Text category="music">This CD is a must for anyone who enjoys
  great guitar music. Its packed full of amazing pieces and
  inspiring playing. My favorite track is Isn't it Romantic because
  it successfully makes a classic out of this song. BUY IT
  NOW!!</Text>
  <Text category="music">Although this sports new remastering,
  unless you have either the Golden Hits CD available here at
  Amazon and your local CD shop, the now out of print Golden
  Celebration boxed set or the 2 volume "Patti Page Collection"
  series (Volume 2 is also out of print), this is unnecessary as it
  duplicates every track on Golden Hits except for Let Me Go Lover
  instead of With My Eyes Wide Open I'm Dreaming and the songs are
  arranged in a different order. Fans are better off looking for
  the 2 previous out of print collections with Let Me Go Lover to
  obtain this track and for the rest of this stuff, either buy
  Golden Hits, the boxed set and the 2 volume Patti Page Collection
  series, and BTW, Vol. 1 is still in print so you can order it
  right here at Amazon</Text>

  radio, i have listened to a lot of comics and I own a lot of
  comic CD's (Mitch Hedberg, Bill Hicks, Emo Philips, Lewis Black,
  Steven Wright, Pablo Francisco etc.) and my absolute favorite is
  Unprotected. There is not a slow part on this CD and it never
  fails to bring everyone to tears on a long car ride. His quick
  and merciless wit is better than any other comic in the US. His
  family must be very understanding since he doesn't hesitate to
  include every detail of their personal lives in his act, but it
  all serves to create a punchline that we can all relate to. The
  highlights of this CD are his daughter's boyfriend and guidelines
  for resuming sex after a heart attack. I highly highly reccomend
  this</Text>
  <Text category="music">If you want some Classical music to sleep
  to, don't buy this CD. If you want some high energy symphonies,
  however, I highly recommend it. From Bach to Vivaldi, the pure
  energy of this CD will give you a new understanding of the joys
  of Classical music. Just don't listen to Track 25, because I have
  no idea why John Philip Sousa is included with
  Tchaichovsky</Text>
  <Text category="music">This is one of the most beautiful,
  restorative collections of Celtic music I have ever heard.
  Haunting, sublime harp, cello, guitar, flute, and soundscapes
  create an atomosphere of serenity for meditation, prayer, or
  simply unwinding the mind and emotions. The poetry which
  originated each selection is included and provides a meditation
  in itself. Highly recommended</Text>
  <Text category="music">Juice Newton is one of the best counry-pop
  singers of all times. A great energetic voice and some real
  unforgettable songs. My personal favourites include the beautiful
  Angel Of The Morning, the rollicking Queen of Hearts and the
  strong and sorrowful It's A Heartache After all these years, her
  work is unforgettable, catchy and full of energy and vibe</Text>
  <Text category="music">I like this album. Its got a nice mix of
  old and new material. Along with some live material. Great to see
  PE still at it in this ever changing rap game</Text>
  <Text category="music">This is a great album. Two of their
  biggest hits, "Another One Bites The Dust," and "Crazy Little
  Thing Called Love," are here. My favorites are "Need Your Loving
  Tonight, " and "Prime Jive." Most of the other songs are top
  notch, too. None of the later Queen albums matched this one.
  Definitely in the class of Night At The Opera, Day At The Races
  and News Of The World</Text>
  <Text category="music">The band is excellent and this album is
  just shy of the high quality of the first. However, the
  encroachment of our free use rights as legal consumers by the
  major record companies will not stop until they see a negative
  financial impact from pushing these copy crippled products. Don't
  support these products</Text>
  <Text category="music">David Foster, who wrote a few tunes on
  Yes's "Time and a Word" is here on bass with Tony Kaye on the B3
  and it's the performance of their lives captured live at the
  Rainbow. A brave but good way to record a debut album, album was
  produced by Jon Anderson and the cover drawn by Roger Dean, just
  like Yes. It gives you feeling that Tony left Yes on good terms
  when Rick Wakeman stepped in</Text>
  <Text category="music">I was looking for some nice background
  nature sounds to have playing while I work throughout the day.
  This collection hits the spot. Great sounds, great variety, great

  <Text category="music">I have listened to this CD for the last
  several years before going to sleep at night. I love classical

  and unwind after a taxing day.</Text>
  <Text category="music">Forget the nit-picky comments you may read
  here, if you are a fan of any of the artists on this album, buy
  it! The recording is of very high quality, and I agree with
  another review, vacuum tube amplification makes the vocals even
  better. The banter between the artists in between the musical
  numbers is a real treat for fans too young to experience these
  shows live. One other observation, if you buy this not having a
  HUGE appreciation for Sammy already, you will be blown away by
  his talent. ..thanks to Sinatra family for releasing this disc.
  Hopefully many more are forthcoming</Text>
  <Text category="music">If you really into French Baroque That
  is......</Text>
  <Text category="music">I was very young to really appreciate the
  in-s and outs of this band and the members between SAMMY, Roth
  and EVH! I honestly can consider myself a newbie to this
  time-tested rockers. I just downloaded this off of iTunes and i
  can tell u folks, every track is amazing! its like when Lars
  (Metallica) said once: "i was always amazed with
  G&amp;amp;R"...if i may borrow this line, i had always heard of
  the great EVH vs. Hagar vs Roth but honestly never appreciated
  this Guitar work before today! EVH is an amazing talent and it
  will continue to influence i am sure allot of new artists. My
  brother in Law was debating with us about Slash, Sammy, EVH, and
  Edge (U2), Clapton and apparently they all chose EVH. I didn't
  believe it till i heard it! EVH is an inspiration. Anyone
  interested even remotely in any of these guys in EVH's history,
  should get this album because it is truly harnesses from almost
  all the worlds EVH has been to and in!</Text>
  <Text category="music">This is part 2 of a set titled SAY IT
  RIGHT. The CD has a blue and white style vs. the part 1 that has
  a yellow and white style on disc and cover. Also in a slim-line
  jewel case with the title track, non-album track, but an added
  dance remix plus video. If you enjoyed the first 2-track CD then
  this is a must. Dance lovers will definitely find this to be a
  totally spectacular production. SAY IT RIGHT [Radio Edit] has the
  catchy dance beats, nice vocals, excellent drums, and chorus. The
  lyrics are fun to sing along and strong in meaning. Apparently,
  it's about not giving a lover power to control, destroy, or make
  you loose sleep. The melody has great rhythm, chorus, dance
  styles, and energetic beats. "You don't mean nothing at all to
  me" is repeated showing a strong message that life doesn't end
  with someone who isn't right. WHAT I WANTED brings Nelly to a
  slower tempo displaying depth of emotion. It's a slow ballad with
  true sincerity and humility. It's about going for something you
  wanted but never got. The outcome doesn't matter because the
  reality is you gave it your all. As she sings about her dream and
  what she wanted it's apparent love can be hard to let go yet
  comforting to do so. The melody is soothing, pleasant in sound,
  and refreshing for the soul. SAY IT RIGHT [Peter Rauhofer Remix
  Part 1] is a hot club remix sure to get you dancing off your
  feet. The song takes a dive to faster paced trance like effects,
  different introduction, pumping jamming dance styles with techno
  flairs, up and down tempos as well as plenty of percussion and
  synthesizers. Straying from the original song the vocals are
  still vastly heard yet filled with echoes, swirls of sounds, and
  much club ambiance. It's dreamy, fantasy filled, and definitely
  highly paced for the dance floor. If anything is certain it is
  this: The Remix in this CD is much better than many of her past
  singles. There is true DJ styles incorporation more
  instrumentations, effects, and vast production much more geared
  to club hoppers and dance fans. Quite sticky, infectious, and
  groove like this remix will get you dancing up a storm feeling
  like wanting to shake your body non-stop. Club lovers don't pass
  this out. Nelly's vocals are echoed often and electronic-a
  effects are vastly hard. SAY IT RIGHT VIDEO [Enhanced CD] is the
  video many have already seen as Timbaland and Nelly dance face to
  face and get very close as the message behind the music is
  reinforced. This is an excellent video with much dance styles,
  highly energetic beats, and flairs for control and getting the
  message across. Overall, from all of Nelly's singles I find this
  to be on the top of my favorite. The combination of 2 highly
  emotional yet different songs plus a dance track and video makes
  this remarkable. Definitely buy this if you are a Nelly fan, club
  hopper, or a lover of music to enjoy for the depth of emotion,
  different styles displayed, and the themes. It's definitely a top
  sensation. Before it sells out be sure to buy it. The part 1 is
  also an excellent addition for those days you don't want to
  listen to the remix. This is highly recommended for sure!</Text>

  <Text category="music">Almost a classic in my book. We bumped
  this on the southside of Chicago when this dropped. These two
  were like a west coast EPMD because they blended perfectly. U
  could tell them apart easily because Gangsta D had the eazy-e
  voice with the hard lyrics. While KK had a gruff voice and was a
  str8 clown. KK would say anything. Once again the whole crew is
  on this one also: Quik, Hi-C, and AMG. They had a tight click
  that just seemed to from Voltron how they worked together. My
  favorites on this album are: If u Want it, Be True 2 yourself,
  Let the Rhythm,and Just Ain't Me (KK solo). I still take hoodrats
  on "Triple MMM Shots".....Listen to the album to find the

  <Text category="music">This EP is so good, that words cannot do
  it justice. They thought so too and exercised restraint (no
  lyrics) on this album. It is a departure from the previous album
  From the Vapor of Gasoline (which is also a very good album) in
  other ways, too, however; it features a more delicate production
  and more intricate interplay between the instruments. The
  production is such that it highlights the timbre of each
  instrument and, thus, their interdependency, whereas the previous
  album seemed content to let everything settle into a murky
  consistency at various points (usually when things started to
  rock). FTVOG also had the problem of being a bit monotonous (of
  course: in the end, you grew to enjoy it for all its
  shortcomings). All the Suits Began to Fall OFf seems to be
  flawless, however - a well-rounded tour; very beautiful, bold and
  particular. Try if you like: John Fahey, Tortoise, June of 44,

  <Text category="music">Modern dub stylings from an assortment of
  recording artists, ranging from the bizarre and brilliant (check
  The Lost Scrolls of Hamarik's darkly deranged How To Find Royal
  Jelly), to the utterly unforgiveable (namely, Luciano's appaling
  attempt at Police &amp;amp;amp; Thieves). Luckily for us, most of
  the tunes here fall into or around the former category, with
  great contributions from St. Germain (bouncing dub-disco on A Dub
  Experience), Grant Phabao (updated roots righteousness on Andub
  Head Yudu) and Boozoo Bajou (with the wonderfully cheesey
  Divers). And let's not overlook Cottonbelly's 90's classic
  Tempest Dub, which resurrects an old Scientist tune to
  spine-tingling effect. Only the fairly plain Seven Dub and the
  aforementioned Luciano really fail to ignite...All in all then, a

  defines how R&amp;amp;P gospel should sound. Trinitee 5:7 along

  Shei Atkins covers it all--Relationships (cheating, divorce,
  pre-marital sex); worship; hymns; enocuragement; you name it and
  she has a song for it. I just bought the CD and I can't take it
  out of my CD player!! Her voice is so annointed and unique! She
  can easily give Beyonce, Erykah Badu and Mary Blige a run for
  their money! She can easily be played on mainstream radio and
  everyone would be bobbin' their heads to it--yet she has no
  problem mentioning Jesus in any of her songs! For those
  Christians who are looking for something that they can groove and
  relax too (with some anointing) PLEASE buy this CD--I promise you

  absolutely beautiful, fresh, and very well paced, and Laura's
  voice is soaring! The quality of this album is exceptional....the
  production of the songs lends to Laura's very passionate approach
  to them. Without understanding a word of either version, I cannot
  get enough of them! Listening to Laura on this latest release of
  hers over and over again, each song continues to grow on me and I
  find myself completely absorbed in this album! Do yourself a
  favor and get this one....especially if you live in the United
  States. It will give you an opportunity to experience the power
  of what music can be if done right. You'll find yourself relating
  to words you don't even understand!</Text>
  <Text category="music">In this CD Laura Pausini performs songs
  from a variety of Italian singer-songwriters. She ads her
  personal touch to all of them, of course. The results are lovely
  and inspired. A lot of the songs already had versions in
  castellano, but Laura and her team have written new Spanish
  lyrics to some of them. All of these songs were made famous by
  their creators. Most of the songs are ballads, but there are some
  midtempo tracks in the title track, "Dos" (Due, by Raf) and
  "Estrella gemela" (by Eros Ramazzotti), and danceable pop in "Mi
  banda toca rock." I don't know about the comment from the
  reviewers below about "Mi banda toca rock" as Menudo song (a
  horrible thought to some of us!), but the original Italian
  version was fun. It's not a bubblegum song, but about the
  combination of traditional Latin music (Latin in the original
  sense, all the musical varieties of romance-language speakers)
  and rock music, something that was starting to happen when the
  song was written. This reminds me that someone was commenting
  that one of the songs had some sections in English. I believe
  they are wrong about the song. "Estrella gemela" has some
  sections in English, but that is the way it was originally
  written and performed by Eros Ramazzotti (in Italian and
  Spanish), to emphasize the influence of African-American gospel
  music in the song. Laura also references this influence by using
  gospel chords at the start of the song. All in all, this is a
  great album, so give it a shot. Whether you speak the language or
  not, the Italian version of the album is even better. Laura just
  keeps getting better with time! Laura sei bravissima</Text>
  <Text category="music">Nothing deep, by any means, but simply a
  light, airy listen, with a compilation of quirky tropical tunes.
  Even though the songs (most of them) weren't in the movie, they
  remind me of it, of the whole Hawaiian atmosphere. My favorite
  tracks, excluding the ones included on the previous CD, are Blue
  Hawai'i (by Elvis), My Little Grass Shack, Coconut (it's just
  bizarre, but addicting, making you smile with absurdity), Island
  in the Sun, Pineapple Princess, and Love Me Tender. Again, it's
  nothing dramatic or swirling, but it you adored Lilo
  &amp;amp;amp; Stitch (And how can you not?) and all it stood for,
  this CD might just bring some warmth into a cold day. Don't think
  about it. Listen and pretend you're there</Text>
  <Text category="music">I borrowed this CD from a public library,
  having liked the track "Crazy Life" on the Empire Records
  Soundtrack, and I was immediately blown away by how consistently
  good Coil is the whole way through. It is their most mature
  album, full of gentle emotion and idealism, and puts the listener
  in a good mood. Glen Phillip's voice is unique, confident, and
  beautiful. I fell in love immediately with "Rings" and "Dam Would
  Break". The haunting and beautiful harmonies captivate. "Little
  Buddha" is so different but so good as well. After I got Coil, I
  bought two of Toad's older albums: Fear and Dulcinea. Both are
  really good, but something keeps drawing me back to Coil. It is
  achingly beautiful, vibrant, thoughtful, and pleasurable. It is
  hearing Toad at their best.</Text>
  <Text category="music">The original Jack johnson LP was my
  favourite Miles record. I also had an expensive Japanese CD but
  all this would not prepare me for what I discover here. Over

  quite a bit of patience to sit trhough all this but it is worth
  the time</Text>
  <Text category="music">I love it so. I bought it after seeing the
  video for "Make You Feel That Way" and I haven't been
  disappointed. Love the vibe of the CD...it just flows and the mix
  is well done, as you go from a "head-nodder" to a smooth groove
  so seamlessly. I just put it in and let it play! My absolute
  favorite jam is "Nowhere Fast," which comments on what we were,
  what we are and what we hope to be "tomorrow." I love this CD so
  much, I went and bought their other two full play CD's. I make my
  girls sick with how much I play this CD. I guess I'll eventually
  take it out the rotation, maybe "tomorrow!" A must for anyone who
  loves great HIP HOP</Text>

  style of his, on Horace Silvers' &amp;amp;quot;song for my

  playing has always sounded mature and developed, like he was born
  to play. On this CD, Felicidade in particuliar, he simmers,
  builds to a rolling boil, and simmers again so nicely as he takes
  you to Brasil. Also the straight ahead playing on Triste' is
  nothing short of marvelous playing by the group! The whole is CD
  is great. Go 'head Joe</Text>
  <Text category="music">This album is the shyit, cougnut and

  in the days&amp;amp;quot; is real old album, so audio can be bad
  for a couple of the tracks but there isnt a weak track on this
  album. The beats don't get too bass heavy untill
  &amp;amp;quot;Hillary&amp;amp;quot; after that song the next 4
  tracks or so are very bass heavy, but the flows are tops. These
  guys are the definition of gangsta, and is a must for anybody who

  <Text category="music">The Bloodshot Gang knows how to have a
  good time! If you're into the whole Alt.Country thing, you know
  that some of it is very sincere and serious (ie, Uncle Tupelo,
  Jayhawks). Now I love "No Depression," and "Blue Earth," but this
  is an altogether different quadrant of alternative country known
  as Militant Honky Tonk, or just Insurgent Country. Truth be told,
  this incredible anniversary compilation does have some poignant,
  serious numbers (Rico Bell's "Money to Burn," the Texas Rubies'
  "Blue Diamond Mine," Mike Ireland's "I'd Like To"), but for the
  most part these maniacs are not taking themselves or the world
  that seriously. You've got Andre Williams and Sally Timms singing
  "I'll stick to you like glue...", in mock romantic seriousness
  with background singers going "G-L-E-U, GLUE!" You've got a song
  with a man and a woman serenading each other saying with deep
  country feeling how much they miss each other's bodies. You've
  got Kim Docter and Moonshine Willy belting out "Turn the Lights
  Down Low," which really ought to be a hit it's so catchy. And
  you've got some great deadpan covers -- the Waco Brothers do a
  country rave-up of the Who's Baba O'Riley," Red Star Belgrade
  does it to AC/DC's "Highway to Hell," and best of all, the Unholy
  Trio turns Public Enemy's "Bring the Noise" into an understated
  redneck anthem. I'm only scratching the surface here, with 40
  tracks over 2 discs. This is a great introduction to the rowdier
  side of that sprawling beast that has not a name that can be
  agreed on... And don't miss the fantastic earlier Bloodshot
  compilation, HELL-BENT (Insurgent Country, Volume II) -- see my
  9/5/04 review</Text>
  <Text category="music">Any one of the first 4 cuts on this album
  are worth the price of admission. These pieces, each melodically
  rich and honed like a fine gem, remind me more of classical
  romanticism than what normally passes for &amp;amp;quot;New
  Age&amp;amp;quot;. Sit back in a cosy armchair with a glass of
  wine and let this beautifully-crafted music weave its web...it's
  &amp;amp;quot;feel good&amp;amp;quot; music that also has an
  intellectually satisfying bittersweet flavor</Text>
  <Text category="music">I consider this the first album in the
  second half of the career of Oasis. Following the departure of
  Bonehead and Guigsy, this album is basically all the Gallagher
  brothers. Having learnt lessons from Be Here Now, Oasis have gone
  back to a more basic style of production as opposed to the over
  the top production from Be Here Now. While the songs are not as
  good on here, they sound better and the whole album sounds as if
  it wasn't as rushed. This signifies a big change of direction for
  the band, with little less ego's and a more sober approach to
  their music, it is only the songwriting that lets this album
  down. My least favourite of all Oasis albums, it features two
  really good songs, 6 mediocre and 2 dreadful ones. It is missing
  another two songs to make it complete, I think it should have
  included the B'sides 'lets all make believe' and 'carry us all'.
  It still includes a few Beatle-esque songs 'who feels love' and
  'roll it over' and Noel once again takes over lead vocal duties,
  this time on two tracks, 'where did it all go wrong' and 'sunday
  morning call'. This is a very important album, it grounded the
  band again after their ego's had taken off. This helped relaunch
  the career and because of it they sound at their best
  today</Text>
  <Text category="music">Herb Alpert has done what few artists can
  do. He's taken his seminal masterwork and transformed it into
  another entity that is equal to or may even surpass the original.
  I love the original "Whipped Cream", but this CD is a
  masterstroke. Combining Alpert's traditionally peppy music with
  downbeat electronica transforms it into a soothing, but never
  boring mix that continues to enchant the listener from beginning
  to end. Unlike some of the purists, I loved this CD and you will
  too</Text>
  <Text category="music">I found this CD by browsing Amazon and
  decided to give it a try. I am happy with all of the tracks. Some
  tracks remind me of Beatles a little, but not all, so the band
  does have a unique sound. Even though from the 90s, the sound is
  like many bands making it today. I like it.</Text>
  <Text category="music">What I love most about Scofield's recent
  guitar playing is the subtlety in his style. He is careful not to
  over do it, while still demonstrating skill and precision. His
  riffs are practically perfect and are very well placed. The only
  problem with this is that with no vocals and many similar
  sounding songs, I rarely make it to the end of this CD. Still for
  those who enjoyed &amp;amp;quot;A Go-Go&amp;amp;quot;, this one
  is quite similar, so make sure to pick it up. This quality funk
  CD with jazz undertones may not being groundbraking, but is a
  great casual listen. (Guitarist can definitely pick up a few
  ideas here!</Text>

  the tone for this wonderful recording. A must have to add to your
  collection</Text>
  <Text category="music">A ridiculously good album. This is as good
  an introduction to Jawbox as you're going to find. It's got most
  of their really great songs, plus some live songs which are
  great. Another good thing is that Desoto Records (the label that
  was started by the band) has re-released the CD, so it shouldn't
  be as hard to find</Text>
  <Text category="music">I gotta be honest, when I first listened
  to this album I was dissapointed. But like any truly amazing
  album, it just took some decoding, listening to the songs
  multiple times reaaaallly helps to appreciate what these guys are
  doing. Essentially, GaT are four people who are amazing at what
  they do, and we should feel lucky that they have found a way to
  mesh together perfectly. Their first album, emphasizer, blew me
  away, but I felt it lost steam around halfway through. This album
  does no such thing, and what is more impressive is that this is
  an all acoustic album, which means skerik is using the natural
  sound of his sax as opposed to the various effects that he is
  known for. This gives the album a much more natural feel and it
  shows that these four are able to make amazing music without any
  wizardry in the production department. But dont get me wrong,
  this cd SOUNDS amazing. Anyway, I saw them live last night in
  NYC, and they blew my mind... I recommend this CD to ANYONE, and
  see them live if you get the RARE opportunity!</Text>
  <Text category="music">Two of the greatest names in show business
  at their zenith. There are so many good tracks on this set that

  standouts are Jolson's "Swanee" and "Rock-A-Bye," although every
  track is just excellent. The sound quality on the set is
  outstandingly great. I hope the people that put this set together
  will do the same incredible job with other classic recordings by
  Jolson and Crosby</Text>
  <Text category="music">This is the best "cover" album I have ever
  seen or heard in my life. A wonderful selection of material and a
  reflection of Agnetha's great judgment of how best to pay tribute
  to her favorite, and most influential, musical artists. Her voice
  is absolutely flawless and just as powerful (and pure) as her
  days of old with ABBA. It would have sold well with the right
  kind of promotion such as touring which I read she had planned at
  one point. Unfortunately, she had to cancel any such ideas. I
  would travel anywhere in the world to see her live just once in
  my life, whether it be to listen to any of the catchy tunes from
  this album or anything previous. We can only hope the day will
  come that she will do a live show again for us adoring and
  anxious fans. It's certainly not out of the realm of possibility.
  It is neither an impossibility that Agnetha record subsequent
  material in the not too distant future as this album without a
  doubt indicates she has so much great music left in her soul to
  share with the world</Text>
  <Text category="music">A true musical genius. Take a blow get a
  ZyR voduski and snapple lemonade and let the music cover you up.
  PowerPLUS from the 70's and 80's. Tight lyrics and pop
  masterpiece arangements. go todd go</Text>
  <Text category="music">Disappear Fear's music is both calming and
  uplifting at the same time. I especially enjoyed "Laws of Nature"
  because of it lyrics. (It has a gay-rights lyrics) Does anyone
  know which one of the singers is gay? I would be quite greatful
  for the answer. If anyone knows, would you mind posting it under
  the reviews here? Thanx that would be great!</Text>
  <Text category="music">I don't see how they can compare these
  guys to The Mars Volta or Coheed and Cambria. I can hear the prog
  elements but it's more of a Rush kind of prog rock,shorter 3
  minute songs compared to 12 minute epics. They are missing the
  one thing that would make them a true prog rock band: the songs
  just aren't as epic as a TMV or a C&amp;amp;amp;C song. I think
  reviewers liken Brazil to these other bands because their singer
  has a high pitched singing voice. This is still an amazing album
  that is well worth your time. Go into it expecting Sparta rather
  than The Mars Volta and you won't be disappointed</Text>
  <Text category="music">When this album first came out, I felt
  jilted. But I recently had an oppertunity to listen to it for
  what it is and I think its a great album. Make no mistake, if
  you're a die-hard 80's rocker, you'll hate this album. The
  production is raw, and the songwriting is lean and mean as
  opposed to elaberate and detailed. But that doesn't mean that the
  musicianship is lacking on this record. If you can keep an open
  mind, I think this ablum is one that you'll love</Text>
  <Text category="music">Dream is a great album where Keller
  coloboarates with many of his favorite musicians including Bob
  Wier, Bella Fleck, Victor Wooten and String Cheese Incident. All
  the songs are unique and great to sing too while driving or
  anytime!</Text>
  <Text category="music">whoa... this CD rocks, one of my favorite
  anti-flag albums for sure. This CD may not be what some of the
  harder punk fans want from anti-flag but i think it also shows
  they're growth as a band. They can play more than just really
  loud hard punk (though they play that awesome too!!). Some of the
  songs on this album incredibly powerful, and some are really
  catchy too. War Sucks Lets Party is a great anarchist anthem, and
  One Trillion Dollars is amazingly moving (i mean, seriously! 1
  Trillion $ spent on weapons around the world in 2004!) Every
  track is good and has its own message! They seem to have no
  problem coming up w/ new songs... there are so many things to
  ridicule in our gov. I just wish that more people would listen to
  this band's message. PEACE and LOV</Text>
  <Text category="music">I bought this for my wife, a huge fan of
  Patrick O'Brian (she's read the books twice in the past two years
  alone). Ironically, it now sits in my car's CD shuffler where it
  undoubtedly gets the most airtime. I love this music! As another
  reviewer mentioned, with some cofee (Killick, there!), this music
  and Desolation Island in your hand, you feel transported to a
  life of long ago. When men sang to rouse the soul, brighten the
  spirit, damn the enemy and win the heart of their Colleen
  (sorry...Nancy) - all with spine, mind and muscle fully intact.
  The harmonies are rich, the voices deep. And yet, the last
  reviewer's questions have the faint ring of truth. My first
  hearing rang a bit flat, the music sounding just this side of
  stale. But, in the end, it just don't signify. Even on that first
  run, by the end of the CD I was clumsily, but merrily joining in
  with the crew. I suppose I have come to imbue the songs with a
  life of my own, belting them out at full volume down the highway.
  I hope you enjoy them as much as I do</Text>
  <Text category="music">NIGHTRAGE - Descent into Chaos - Thomas
  Lindberg's latest offering to the music community is the Swedish
  and Greek mix called Nightrage. This album actually being my
  first offering to the band I was unsure what to expect. Like most
  I am a big fan of ATG and Lindberg's harsh vocal styles....
  Nightrage however came as a pleasant surprise. (As in it wasn't,
  yet another, ATG Clone) They seem to have more Melody than Thrash
  but definitely embody aspects of both genres.... The Haunted,
  where the former ATG Guitar Players are now located, seemed have
  gone with more Thrash then Melody. (Which is odd since they
  actually have ATG's Guitar Players?) Anyway, Enough Comparisons!
  Nightrage is really decent for a newer band in an over saturated
  scene... Amazing guitar work and one of the genres best Vocalist
  makes this CD well worth a couple of listens. Also I've only
  given this album 2 spins at the current time and stuff like this
  usually grows on repeated listens. Favorite Songs: Being Nothing,
  Phantasma, Omen, and Descent into Chaos. -4 Stars IF YOU LIKED,
  AGREED, OR APPRECIATED THIS PLEASE CLICK YES FOR: "Was this
  review helpful?"</Text>
  <Text category="music">Well, this isn't At the Gates. Nightrage
  reminds me of many old Arch Enemy guitar tunes that were so
  melodic. Of course, that leads into Gus G. substituting Chris on
  concerts being an excellent choice, as they make very similar
  melodies. Some people say this album is heavy, which it is in
  some parts. But its melodic death, there are no signs of thrash
  or anything. Just great melodies, great headbanging music. Add
  this to your collection, I think its better than Sweet
  Vengeance</Text>
  <Text category="music">Chris Joss delivers some serious
  blaxploitation inspired grooves that will wisk you back to the
  times of bell bottoms, afros and platform shoes! Joss' "You've
  Been Spiked" is a retrospective piece of marvellously produced
  tracks that pays true homage to an era that gave us some of the
  funkiest music ever! In fact, this music sounds so authentic you
  would think they came straight out of the 70's...but it's all
  circa the 21st century. It's good to know that there are still
  modern cats (especially on the ESL Record label)who know how to
  recapture music from days gone by.</Text>
  <Text category="music">This is a really great follow up to
  Allison Moorer's debut album ALABAMA SONG. THE HARDEST PART, her
  sophomore CD, was released two years after her debut in September
  2000. It builds on the sound presented on her first, and the
  songs are nothing short of great. My favorite track, though not
  her own, is her emotional reading of the Rolling Stones'
  &amp;amp;quot;Bring Me All Your Lovin&amp;amp;quot;. She makes
  this song into her own. &amp;amp;quot;No Next Time&amp;amp;quot;
  is another favorite, the lyrics are excellent, a great breakup
  song. The title track is a nice midtempo country number.
  &amp;amp;quot;Send Down An Angel&amp;amp;quot; is very sad but
  touching at the same time. Other highlights include
  &amp;amp;quot;It's Time That I Tried&amp;amp;quot;,
  &amp;amp;quot;Day You Said Goodbye&amp;amp;quot;,
  &amp;amp;quot;Is It Worth It&amp;amp;quot; and
  &amp;amp;quot;Feeling That Feeling Again&amp;amp;quot;. Overall,
  to me this is her best album. You can't go wrong with any of them
  but this is an artistic acheivement, and one of her best albums
  yet</Text>
  <Text category="music">I have been a fan since Valotte. and I
  like the other reviewers here, can't believe why this cd didn't
  receive the airplay it deserves!There must have been some
  politics in there, with Sean's cd coming out on the same day (
  Yoko?) It is one of those cds that you just leave on and you
  don't feel like you have to go and skip over songs that you don't
  like! I love every song!! Especially "Day after Day"," I should
  have known", "I don't want to know" and my fav right now "Cold"..
  I hope that what I have heard is true that he is working on his
  latest now. Can't wait! Buy this cd.. you won't regret it</Text>
  <Text category="music">Every singer ends up attempting Sinatra
  eventually, but few manage so well.... John Pizzarelli has been
  playing jazz guitar with his legendary father, Bucky, since he
  was 6 years old. John's latest album is Dear Mr. Sinatra, on
  which he plays songs written for Ol' Blue Eyes.... The crooner is
  noted for his sensitive phrasing and powerful interpretative
  voice, which recall the relaxed stylings of Nat "King" Cole and
  Chet Baker, as well as for his fluid, inventive guitar playing.
  On this album of covers of songs made famous by Frank Sinatra,
  John Pizzarelli wisely avoids the pitfalls of Ol' Blue Eyes
  imitations in favor of his own intimate approach, best heard on
  the set's more relaxed arrangements. My highlights are the tracks
  "I've Got You Under My Skin", "Nice and Easy" and "You Make Me
  Feel So Young". Both attention-grabbing and supportive, his
  expertly arranged big band accompaniment likewise evokes the
  ring-a-ding-ding of the Rat Pack era while steering clear of mere
  pastiche. With a total time just under 40 minutes, the program is
  a little short by CD standards, but the performances by John
  Pizzarelli and the Clayton-Hamilton Jazz Orchestra in this warm
  tribute to Frank Sinatra are consistently of high caliber and hit
  the mark every time.</Text>
  <Text category="music">No use thumbing the pages of Cale's
  elegant scrapbook of an autobiography, 'What's Welsh For Zen?, to
  glean hard data on this one melodic gem. Coming after the heady,
  if problematic days of the Velvets, there's barely an
  acknowledgement of it as he strides into his rock format. The
  abrasive thrashing rock of 'McBeth'(while indicating his imminent
  direction) serves the one discordant note. Throughout,Cale
  namedrops to effect learnedness without destroying the mood of a
  distant past. Language had been severed from lineal meaning, in
  rock, since Bob went electric. Pete Brown writing for Jack
  Bruce's towering masterpieces, 'Songs For a Sailor', &amp;amp;
  'Harmony Row'; Keith Reid with Procul Harum, were mixing up the
  lyric medicine, presumably with other pharmacuticals &amp;amp;
  making sumptuous music on a par with 'Paris 1919'. That date? The
  birth of Surrealism,(and similar writing to Cale's efforts
  herein) perhaps? The Russian Revolution? Cale's singing on 1919
  had a world weary distance to it, which suited the reflective
  jabberwocky of the songs; stretched out vowells on,'planing
  lakes', 'elephants that sing','looking out from here at half past
  France.' It was far from banal music, however saccharine the
  orchestral moves from strings, viola &amp;amp; piano Cale
  painted. These lyrics were baffling but made perfect poetic sense
  when sung. 'Locusts' was something of a revisiting to this
  pastoral mood but lacks the roundedness. 'Fragments of a Rainy
  Season' is a good retrospective concert. And some of the fuge
  written around the hommage to Andy Warhol is very moving stuff.
  Go John</Text>
  <Text category="music">This is a fabulous CD and exactly what I
  was looking for. I'm also thrilled that it has an accompanying
  book with all the sheet music. I am leading a seder this year for
  a church group who has never heard any of the songs before, so I
  wanted the traditional melodies, easy to follow sheet music, and
  easy guitar chords. This is perfect! I'm so pleased</Text>
  <Text category="music">This is a difficult album to review.
  People either embrace it or pass it off as an overproduced,
  overblown waste of their time. However, I can say that this is my
  favorite Oasis album. Why? That's a very good question...maybe
  because Be Here Now was my introduction to Oasis, and I could
  tell that this band had a lot to offer, even through the
  drug-addled, overproduced songs that seemed to last forever. Each
  one is very catchy and has an overall feel-good quality to it,
  two characteristics of most Oasis songs. It's no use comparing Be
  Here Now to Morning Glory or Def. Maybe, because it's in a whole
  other ballpark. This is Oasis going totally over the top and
  pushing their music to the limit. No doubt that all the coke
  helped with that. It's my firm belief that Morning Glory and Def.
  Maybe were and still are great albums in their own rights. Be
  Here Now is just something else, you either love it or hate it.
  It has it's own little Oasis category. I can see why it never
  really lived up to its two famous predecessors. There are some
  valid complaints about this album, though. One, it is very very
  overproduced, filled to the top with snarling buzzing guitars and
  who knows what else. Unfortunately, this makes it hard to listen
  to with earphones for very long. Two, the songs are astonishingly
  long at times. All Around the World, while an excellent song,
  clocks in at around 9:20. I believe that the shortest song is I
  Hope, I Think, I Know, coming in at 4:23. So you know you're in
  for a long, wild ride. However, only Oasis could pull this off -
  making ridiculously long songs that are almost ear-numbing to
  listen to - and every minute is made enjoyable. All the
  arrogance, coke, and swagger in these songs is perhaps what makes
  it so appealing to some people. And of course, there's that small
  note on the upper left-hand corner of pages 7 and 8 in the
  booklet that proclaims : "The Beatles are quite good, but Oasis
  is much better." And so a resounding yes to all of these:
  overproduced, arrogant, drug-induced, staggering, amazing,
  excellent. I don't care about the negative things, though,
  because that's what makes Be Here Now a sucess in its own
  right.</Text>
  <Text category="music">I have been listening to this album for at
  least 12 years and it rarely leaves my CD changer. I played the
  cassette version until it literally would not play any more, and
  it was one of the first CDs I bought. A relative first introduced
  me to this album and of course &amp;amp;quot;Coming Up
  Close&amp;amp;quot; was the reason I bought my own copy. But I
  came to love each song and appreciate Aimee Mann as an
  exceptionally gifted songwriter. It is a great &amp;amp;quot;Road
  Trip&amp;amp;quot; album and &amp;amp;quot;On
  Sunday&amp;amp;quot; makes the perfect &amp;amp;quot;Summer
  Song&amp;amp;quot;. The mix is not mainstream pop/rock. It is not
  a 1980's anthem, but it is one of the defining moments, for me.
  The lyrics have meaning, which sometimes defies what the '80's
  were about. The only other thing I can say is Listen to this CD!
  I am sure you will find Mann's unique voice as captivating as I
  do. It is a definite must have for one's CD library</Text>
  <Text category="music">...and if you're fortunate enough to find
  it, I recommend buying the version with the bonus DVD, which
  chronicles the making of Yellow Brick Road. When I bought it, it
  cost the same as the 2 SACD set without the DVD, so it was still
  a great deal. My only complaint--and it's really minor--is that
  it would have been nice if they could have fit the original album
  onto a single SACD. A second disc could have included the bonus
  tracks that are included in this package, plus any extra--maybe
  even audio-only interviews--still remaining in the vaults. No
  matter. The important thing, if you are able, is to make sure you
  have an SACD-compatible player (like the Pioneer DV-563A, or one
  of the really expensive players if you've got the cash and love
  audiophile formats in both your hardware and your CDs). Even if
  you don't, the stereo CD layer still sounds truly
  excellent</Text>
  <Text category="music">Did you lose interest in new rock in the
  past several years because all those loud songs on the FM station
  sound about the same? Maybe you noticed one song in there
  somewhere that had memorable hooks and interesting lyrics among
  the crunching guitars? The Libertines are - or at least were -
  one of those diamonds in the rough. Their raw, loud style is
  closer to punk than any other genre, but most of their songs are
  more well-developed than that suggests and might even appeal to
  classic rock fans. Make no mistake, though, this is a loud album.
  With the exception of the oddly balladish "Radio America," it's a
  pretty steady sonic assault, and the lyrics are mostly somewhere
  between "Louie Louie" and live Dylan on the intelligibility
  scale. What can be understood is more erudite than you'd expect,
  though. "What a Waster" is a frighteningly vivid look at drug
  addiction, "Boys in the Band" is the best groupie song I've heard
  in a long time, and "The Good Old Days" actually reveals a touch
  of sentimentality just under the power chords. Decipherable or
  not, most of the other songs are at least very catchy. The whole
  collection is a nice balance between aggressive style and
  memorable songs that has been all too lacking for a long time
  now.</Text>
  <Text category="music">About the Band: Dead Can Dance is
  considered the seminal example of the ethereal or heavenly voices
  genre. In fact, the name of the label, 4AD, which carried many of
  the 1990s DCD releases, is sometimes also used to describe this
  genre of music, which is a fusion of subtle electronics, vocals,
  drums, world music, and a near limitless count of instruments.
  Brendan Perry sometimes has been described as a gothic Frank
  Sinatra. Lisa Gerrard's enchanting vocals are often sung in a
  language only known to Lisa. I count myself among the many that
  hold these two musicians in the highest esteem. About the Album:
  Compared to more recent albums that are loaded with bonus tracks,
  the 50-minutes of Into the Labyrinth would seem short, if it
  weren't for the fact that I like to listen to this album over and
  over again. I count this album as one of my all time favorites,
  and certainly my most prized Dead Can Dance CD. One of the nicest
  things about this album is that it features nearly equal amounts
  of both Lisa's and Brendan's ghostly vocals. On some tracks they
  accompany each other, while others feature only one of the
  artist's chilling or mystical sounding vocals. Simply put, this
  is beautiful music to relax to. I honestly give this album my
  highest recommendations! Two tracks I'd recommend sampling:
  "Towards the Within" (featuring Lisa's vox w/ Brendan backing)
  and "Tell Me About the Forest" (featuring Brendan's vox). I
  believe they best represent the range of songs you can expect
  with this album. Please note that while all the tracks feature
  vocals, the lyrics for only those sung in English are included in
  the liner notes. Similar Artists: Chances are if you aren't yet
  familiar with Dead Can Dance, that you've not yet discovered some
  of these other bands, but I highly recommend them as well: Das
  Zeichen, Impressions of Winter, Love is Colder Than Death, Qntal,
  Corvus Corax, or Helium Vola. There is a rather large (and
  somewhat underappreciated) range of artists still producing
  heavenly voices music that is similar in quality to Dead Can
  Dance. Please check some of them out as well.</Text>
  <Text category="music">This is by far the best psychopathic album
  ever released. Riddlebox is now in second place. Madrox schools
  ever other artist on psychopathic with this album. Beats are
  bangin' and lyrics are flawless! Great flows and he mixes funny
  with wicked. Best songs are This B*tch and Hey Phatty. Great
  album by the best rapper of our time. Madrox is so under rated. I
  wish for his sake he would blow up huge but not lose his soul in
  the process. Buy this album, best rap album ever made</Text>
  <Text category="music">Percy Grainger was a man of spectacular
  gifts. He was one of the most original composer/arrangers in the
  early part of this century. He was also a spectacular pianist in
  an age of spectacular pianists. This amazing CD documents
  Grainger's formidible gifts. It cannot be over-praised. Both the
  music and the performances are well worthy of any piano lover's
  attention. Don't miss this one</Text>
  <Text category="music">I own a lot of Waylon Jennings albums but
  I have to say, I find myself playing this one on 9 out of 10
  times. If you want to buy just one Waylon album this is the one
  to own, the recording quality is brilliant for a live album and
  the music IS alive. Simply great, I can't say enough good things
  about this CD</Text>
  <Text category="music">Considered one of Coltrane's 'searching'
  periods, this CD has a lot to offer in the way of understanding
  Trane's restless nature. Never one to stand on laurels, Coltrane
  does indeed continue to set the bar 'higher' every time out. This
  one is mostly ballad and blues based, with the exeption of 2
  tracks in particular which stand out - on both ends of the Trane
  spectrum. Track #2, "I Love You" finds him playing furious,
  cerebral runs on the instrument, and , frankly, not as
  'listenable' as one may like; whereas the track with Donald Byrd
  is as 'in the pocket' as you'll ever hear. All in all, a very
  realistic look at a genius in motion</Text>
  <Text category="music">I consider this to be one of the finest
  live Coltrane recordings out there. It was also one of the first
  Coltrane albums I picked up, and it was a fantastic gateway to
  some of his more abstract live recordings on followup releases
  like LIVE AT THE VILLAGE VANGUARD AGAIN and LIVE IN JAPAN. This
  is much more similar to AFRO BLUE IMPRESSIONS which is another
  overlooked release. By this point in time, Trane had already done
  some work with Eric Dolphy and his playing was growing in a much
  more abstract direction as we would hear on A LOVE SUPREME just
  one year later. One of the reasons why this disc is overlooked is
  because Elvin Jones is replaced by Roy Haynes, while Jones was
  serving some jail time. The absence of Jones is noticeable but I
  still think this is worthy of five stars. The first 3 tracks are
  from the Newport Jazz Festival and in addition to Haynes and
  Trane, we have the remaining quartet members, McCoy Tyner (piano)
  and Jimmy Garrison (bass). Tyner is especially amazing on 'My
  Favorite Things' which I consider the best version of that piece
  in Trane's entire catalogue. I consider it to be a bridge to some
  of his later recordings. This is because we get Trane's two
  sides. First of all there is great tone and lyricism in the first
  part of the piece. However, the song still goes on for 17 minutes
  and the interplay between Tyner and Haynes for much of it is
  amazing. Rounding out the performance is Billy Eckstine's 'I Want
  to Talk About You' with a mesmerizing credenza which is a staple
  of Trane's technique, followed by a 15 minute version of
  'Impressions.' Again we hear Trane's two sides. On one hand we
  hear where he is COMING from. which is the confines of other jazz
  gods like Miles Davis and Thelonius Monk. On the the other hand
  we can see where he is GOING, which is a much more
  abstract/free-jazz approach. Once you can begin to understand
  Trane's more abstract side, you will find later recordings less
  challenging, such as INTERSTELLAR SPACE, MEDITATIONS, or A LOVE
  SUPREME. In addition to the three Newport recordings, there is an
  extra track from November of 1961 from the Village Vanguard.
  'Chasin' Another Trane' is played by Haynes and Trane as well as
  Dolphy on alto sax and Reggie Workman on bass. The presence of
  Dolphy and the removal of piano makes this the most avant-garde
  piece on the record, almost reminiscent of early Ornette Coleman.
  Coltrane really cooks on this record, and the sound quality is
  also pretty decent. It's not as crystal clear as his Carnegie
  Hall concert with Monk, but nevertheless, I consider it a great
  place to start for Trane fans who are reluctant to embrace his
  later music.</Text>
  <Text category="music">This is a compilation, but the original
  Incense and Peppermints album was really revolutinary for the
  time. I will date myself now, but I remember hearing this song on
  the radio in our car and was mesmerized by it. It was the first
  Lp I had ever bought. I actually wore out the groves on the Lp
  and came across another a few years ago. To this day, almost 40
  years after I first heard the Strawberry Alarm Clock, I still
  like Incense and Peppermints as well as their other songs. Their
  style ranges from acid rock to jazz. The musicians are all very
  talented and the band works as a team as opposed to many of the
  bands of the era. Their recordings are really high quality and
  certainly not over processed like a lot of today's music is. SAC
  was in an era where 60's music was in transition from the early
  Beatles and old time R&amp;amp;R sound to a more acid rock sound.
  Lyrics like 'tune in, turn on, turn your eyes around.. look at
  yourself' were typical of SAC's lyrical style as well as the
  thinking of the times. It was an odd time. On one side, we had
  Woodstock, mini-skirts, muscle cars and fun fun fun, But, on the
  dark side, there were civil rights problems and the Viet Nam war.
  This transitional period was a kind of awakening for the country
  and for music. Although not as popular as names like the Doors,
  Jefferson Airplane and Steppenwolf, the Strawberry Alarm Clock
  still had a huge following. My only regret is that I didn't get a
  chance to see them (or the Doors!) when they came to the city
  where I lived during the late 60's. This album is a nice
  compilation of SAC's hits. The songs are as fresh and original
  sounding as they were almost 40 years ago.</Text>
  <Text category="music">The CD is truly the very best of Bobby

  <Text category="music">This album is ridiculous. I almost want to
  say part of SRV's soul is in this guy...he is that good. Honestly
  I think this album rips apart his previous two. My hope is that
  Jimmy, DT and APO will bring out a 4th release...as good as this
  album or better! THIS IS ONE OF THOSE GREAT ALBUMS WHERE EVERY

  have brought part of SRV back, because this album is just plain

  <Text category="music">Purchased this album because of the great
  Album cover, was I surprised when I popped it into my CD player.
  I hadn't heard of Rick Braun before but after listening to this

  Never have I heard a trumpet sound so beautiful. Share this music

  <Text category="music">The first time you play this CD you're
  just gonna hate it. Promise Ring's third album is the opposite of
  this. Very Emergency is super catchy and tight but you get sick
  of it quick, there's just not much there. That understood, this
  album will rock you for years. It grows on you. At first listen
  it sounds like really bad emo demos. Like the faceless band you
  saw open for Fugazi the last time they hobbled into town. No
  hooks, no choruses, lots of really bad singing and sloppy guitar
  [with the drums mixed way too loud, an emo thing]. On the 100th
  listen, if you make it that far, it will sound like an old friend
  yammerin' on about the good old days. Trust me, it's a desert
  island disc in the making, I envy those of you just discovering
  this Cd</Text>
  <Text category="music">If this album didn't come out at its
  destinated time, 2006 would have been one of the worst years for
  gospel music. Outside of Kurt Carr's cd, this album makes singing
  gospel music worthwhile. Donald Lawrence knows how to send out a
  group and bring in a new era of singers. That's basically what
  this finale does, it brings into the forefront the future of the
  gospel music scene. We have new artists emerging in Blanche
  (McAlister-not sure if she is going to just do the first name
  like MaDonna, Cher, Mandisa, ummmmm, think about it!!!!!!!!),
  DeWayne Woods (thanks for the testimony and great Sunday morning
  rocking song - this is hint to all church musicians sing this
  song when church is a lil dead and pick it up), The Murrills,
  LaJeune Thompson (sang girl), and Sheri from the duo of Ted
  &amp;amp; Sheri. There are so many hits on the whole cd from God
  Is, God, You Are An Heir, Giants, Blessing from Abraham,
  Encourage Yourself, of course all of the older stuff. One thing
  missing is Kelly Price should have guested on I Walk With God or
  bring back Stephanie Mills.</Text>
  <Text category="music">The best place to start with the best is
  at the beginning. Enya's The Celts (identical to the original
  1980s release simply called Enya) is a beautiful collection of
  music. Enya is not an artist where you just get the "Best of"
  album. Every CD is a best of in itself</Text>
  <Text category="music">Never mind the fact that Jay introduced
  the jazz world to Charlie Parker. His band rocked! After
  Basie,nobody swung like McShann. this 2 dis set covers the big
  band sides and the later 40's small band jump blues sides.
  Anything by this man is worth listening to. Another great disc by
  the Proper label, who release wonderful compilations with
  informative booklets at a bargain price. Highly
  recommended</Text>
  <Text category="music">Unbelievably and indubitably a bona fide,
  and fortified roots reggae album! If you don't have Firehouse
  Rock in your CD collection and you consider yourself a reggae
  fan, you may need to re-evaluate what you think you know about
  Jamaican music. The Roots Radics, especially the rythym section,
  utilize (with supreme efficacy, I might add) and epitomize the
  manipulation of space and time so often associated with reggae
  "riddims." On top of the Radics, the Wailing Souls add ethereal
  vocals, while staying masterfully conscious. Firehouse Rock is a
  beautifully recorded piece of audible Jamaican history and an
  absolute must have</Text>
  <Text category="music">okay!!!after their debut album,i was like
  okay,they are sad over the revolution being
  disbanded.well!!!!fruit at the bottom was like,okay ,we're over
  it,let's jam!!!i saw the video for &amp;amp;quot;are you my baby

  <Text category="music">You won't stop bobbin yo head until its

  <Text category="music">If you enjoyed Explosions In The Sky's
  last album "The Earth Is Not A Cold Dead Place", and the songs by
  the group on the "friday night lights soundtrack", then surely,
  you shall find love for their newest record "All of a Sudden I
  Miss Everyone". If you are new to Explosions In The Sky, I can
  only personally describe their music to you as lush, captivating,
  graceful, energetic, and highly inspirational art rock
  instrumentations. Please ignore reviewers who rate this album
  negatively because they don't like it as much as their last
  album(yet). "All of a Sudden I Miss Everyone" is different than
  previous records; It is alot darker, but at the same time hopeful
  and promising, best listened to on a rainy day or a cold dark
  night(again, personal description). What more can I say... this
  is about as beautiful as three guitars and a drum set can sound.
  My favorite album of 2007 so far.</Text>
  <Text category="music">I first heard Dan singing background
  vocals on the Jackson Browne album "Late for the Sky". I was 16.
  I went out and bought this album (which I STILL have!!) even
  though I had never heard it. I had the pleasure of seeing Dan
  open for the Eagles at the Spectrum in support of this album in
  Phila, in 1974; I was a junior in high school. They all joined in
  on "Best of My Love" and it just blew mw away. He had this really
  interesting piece of cloth on his piano. Few people had heard of
  him prior to this album. This is by far his BEST album. It is
  more rock and roll than the rest of his sappy later work in the
  80's and a true songwriting gem. I can remember singing "Morning
  Sky" in my friend's Ford on the way to school. You have to listen
  to it over and over.. "Someone's Been Tellin' You Stories" had a
  sly sexual rhyme in it that was not played on radio at that time.
  The musicianship on this album only serve to enhance the quality
  of the songwriting. This was the most raw of Dan's albums, and by
  ar, the most superior. Sadly, Dan is now fighting advanced
  prostate cancer (check out his website). Let's hope he will make
  a full recovery and record and tour again soon. This is a must
  have for anyone who is a fan of any 1970's rock and roll.</Text>
  <Text category="music">Top to bottom this album has it all -
  makes you laugh , makes you think , makes you want to dance. I
  can't wait till mainstream finally catches up and the music
  industry finally recognizes what a gift Todd Snider is and the
  talent he posseses. His music will inspire you to move something
  whether it's your brain or your bottom! Check him out</Text>
  <Text category="music">I bought this album when it was first
  released in the 70's. Heaven and Hell was hot item and passed
  through my senior school from ear to ear amongst 'those kids in
  the know' in much the same way that a joint would these days. The
  movements build on a theme throughout the work and reflect the
  care that went into creating some classical overtures. Only later
  in life could I get the similarities to Carl Orf and
  Khachaturian. This is a real masterpiece and a snapshot in time
  of when Prog really was prog. Listen to it in full and then
  catalogue alongside Camel's 'The Snow Goose', the original
  'Tubular Bells' by MIke Oldfield, 'Brain Salad Surgery' by ELP
  and finally ' Snowflakes are dancing' by Tomita. Please dont
  compare this work to the keybored pop, I chose my spelling, of
  the 1980's If you enjoy Vangelis, as I do, you might also want to
  listen to the compositions of Ennio Morricone, he is the man who
  wrote that great music that follows Clint Eastwood in the Sergio
  Leone spaghetti westerns.</Text>
  <Text category="music">This CD has all of the cuts that you
  remember from back in the day...you will love it...it is always
  in my car</Text>
  <Text category="music">Jigga is incredibly hot on this album
  Beanie is good to great. Memphis Bleek, is really good on this
  album, but is overshadowed. His "534" shows how good he is, this
  album does not. Overall as an album it does a good job of showing
  off Roc A Fella, but not to much about the Dynasty</Text>
  <Text category="music">The music contained Trout Mask Replica is
  some of the most unique, acid-drenched art to ever be pressed.
  The songs on the album are mainly divided into folkish a capella
  tunes and the crazed jams the Captain and his band are known for.
  Several strange, unconventional themes are visited and revisted
  throughout the track list, such as bulbs, gingham, trout, and a
  variety of other surreal, sensously described wildlife. However,
  if there's any reason to buy Captain Beefheart's Trout Mask
  Replica, it's to listen to the album as a whole. I find it
  difficult to listen to any other way. While I find this to be
  true, I do have favorites that I go to when introducing friends
  to the Captain, or simply jamming out to without dedicating
  myself to the full experience: "Ella Guru", "Dachaus Blues",
  "Dust Blows Forward", "Neone Meat Dream", and "Old Fart at Play"
  stick out</Text>
  <Text category="music">....and secured their musical legacy. The
  Real Thing was a solid rock/rap mixture with newly hired Mike
  Patton providing vocals. On Angel Dust, Patton had a lot more
  creative input, providing his wonderful vocal stylings and
  schizophrenic persona to Faith No More. It's a joyous ride that
  after a less than stellar performance initially, has become
  something of a cult classic and favorite among many newer acts -
  and with good reason. This album is all over the board. Land of
  Sunshine reads like a list of fortune cookies (which is the
  supposed inspiration), while Caffeine is an anthem for Patton's
  drug of choice, and one of FNM's most energetic recordings. Then
  there is the occaisonal oddball track showing Patton's range and
  sense of fun, like RV, which is like a melancholic rant from the
  stereotypical figure you might find living in an RV. Not exactly
  bilboard material, but fun. Adding to the record were the
  internal tensions of the band. Jim Martin was having creative
  differences, yet pumps out some of his best work here. Tensions
  may have fueld a more agressive record, and FNM would never sound
  better than they do on this album. It's the bands chemistry -
  both good and bad - that make this album work. Commercially, this
  might have not been the hit the record company wanted, but its
  legacy can still be heard today and it's still a great record to
  crank up for a drive, barely showing its 15 year old age</Text>
  <Text category="music">One reviewer remarked that Morten Veland
  had &amp;amp;quot;done it again.&amp;amp;quot; Yup, he shot
  himself in the foot again, just like he did on Tristania's
  &amp;amp;quot;Beyond the Veil.&amp;amp;quot; Veland has an
  obvious talent in songwriting and building arrangements, and he
  definitely has a knack for surrounding himself with quality
  musicians. His problem is that rather than using his death metal
  growling for proper effect, where it's appropriate, he just
  plasters it everywhere, and again lessens what would otherwise
  have been an incredible CD. With all of the talent that is
  present in this band, it would certainly have been better to let
  them come out of the background a little more. The songs where
  Veland does that (which are all too few), like &amp;amp;quot;On
  the Wane,&amp;amp;quot; are easily the CD's best moments. To the
  band's credit, the songs are more varied than on BOTV, with some
  of the guitar parts sounding like more traditional heavy metal
  riffs (especially at the beginning of the opening track). It's
  definitely still melodic goth-metal, but shows some new
  directions for Veland, which I find promising. Now, if he would
  just cut back on the growling...say to 50% of the CD...Sirenia's
  next CD will be a sure winner</Text>
  <Text category="music">If you have never heard Book Of Shadows by
  Zakk Wylde, then you may be suprised by this album. The two
  albums are similiar in that they contain a lot more acoustic
  guitar, and although I'm not saying that past releases have not
  contained emotion, HM VI contains more. For example, take 'She
  Deserves a free ride' and the ballad 'Fear'. The piano on this
  album is superb, haunting at one point and almost relaxing at
  another. However, there is just enough of past 'metal' BLS in
  this album - 'Crazy or High' and 'House Of Doom'. Personal
  favourites are 'Damage is Done', 'Layne' and 'Queen Of Sorrow'.
  There is something more in the solo's - they come in at just the
  right time and as usual are perfectly executed - check out
  'Stepping Stone' for an example. The musicianship has got even
  better on this album, with the dodgy drums on 1919 Eternal Gone,
  and the bass that was pushed to the background in The Blessed
  Hellride is up there with Zakk's playing. This album is deep,
  moving piece that is the perfect successor to the blistering
  Blessed Hellride. Can't wait for the new Mafia CD to be
  released.</Text>
  <Text category="music">i just purchased this album, my first
  misfits album and every song on it rocks (i especially like where
  eagles dare). i just bought two more albums, walk among us and
  static age and i wish they would hurry up and get here in the
  mail because i cant wait. my only complain is the sound quality.
  it sounds like they put a dollar store tape recorder in the
  corner and started rocking...but i guess that makes it sound more
  real too. metallica covered a couple of their albums on their
  garage album but it just isnt the same.</Text>
  <Text category="music">I usually don't do album reviews but I
  gotta say this was tight from beginning to end and I was shook
  that this was given a low reading by a magazine I call
  &amp;amp;quot;The Sauce&amp;amp;quot; So many of yall need to
  stop reading magazine ratings and come to sites likes this and
  read your own peers ratings. Word of mouth is bliss. A-G-2-A-KE
  who came out on Rap-A-Lot hasn't come out with a cd since this
  classic. I'm salty they didn't &amp;amp;quot;make
  it&amp;amp;quot; because this was heavily slept on</Text>
  <Text category="music">"Vangelis: Themes" is a collection of some
  rare and some more popular theatrical theme music from movies
  including "Blade Runner" and "Mutiny On the Bounty." It's an
  extraordinary album and I highly recommend it</Text>
  <Text category="music">For the past few years it has been very
  difficult to locate Candid jazz CDs, the label that critic Nat
  Hentoff created over forty years ago. This was a real shame
  because some classic recordings, including Booker Little's "Out
  Front" and Max Roach's "We Insist!: Freedom Now Suite," were on
  this label. I am happy to report that it was not because all of
  the albums were being deleted, but because they were (slowly)
  being remastered. Now some of the seminal early recordings of
  iconoclastic pianist Cecil Taylor are resurfacing, like "Jumpin'
  Punkins" and now "The World of Cecil Taylor." It is my opinion
  that Taylor's currently unavailable (at least domestically) "New
  York City R&amp;amp;B" and "World of C.T." are two of the great
  new jazz recordings of the early 60s. "World," recorded over two
  successive days in October 1960, is basically a trio date, with
  Buell Neidlinger on bass and Dennis Charles on drums, and Archie
  Shepp joining on tenor sax for two tracks, "Air" and the standard
  "Lazy Afternoon." This disc is one of Shepp's first recorded
  performances and the saxman apparently had trouble with Taylor's
  music -- I recall the now out of print Mosaic set of this
  material collecting some 15 plus outtakes of "Air." But the
  master takes are truly masterful, and I am delighted that with
  this CD available once again, we can all return to "The World of
  Cecil Taylor.</Text>
  <Text category="music">If you are looking for true HIP-HOP, this

  <Text category="music">I Never Loved A Man The Way I Love You,
  what more can you say about the greates soul album of all time.
  This album released all of the music in Aretha that was screaming
  to be released. It displayed a very mature Aretha with complex
  emotions, very everyday lyrics, ones that make you say, oh yeah
  girl, lol. but also a delivery that the average person couldn't
  lay down and dream about pulling off. This is just testiment
  that, even at such a young age, she was THE QUEEN</Text>
  <Text category="music">Dj Shadow is in my honest opinion one of
  the most overlooked artists in music today. Threading the thin
  line between commercial and underground, and finding his niche
  somewhere in between (as UNKLE says, the middle ground between
  light and shadow) DJ Shadow continues to impress with every
  release he puts forth. I was fortunate enough to pick this album
  up right after its release, and actually purchased it before I
  bought Endtroducing, which is by far DJ Shadow's best album, and
  one of the best albums ever made. By sampling elements from just
  about anywhere Shadow combines elements from our pop culture to
  create mini-movies of his songs which few artists can touch in
  terms of sheer production value, and the emotional effect that is
  created while listening to his music. I am actually glad I bought
  this album before Endtroducing as it has given me the time to
  truly appreciate this album for what it is; a work of art, and a
  continual growing of Shadow's talents. Had I bought Endtroducing
  before this and writtwn a review I'm sure I would have garnered
  it with a 4 star review, but that is simply not the case here.
  While Endtroducing is always going to be leaques above and beyond
  this album, Josh Davis has found a way here to go above and
  beyond what should be expected of an album, and given us an album
  that I'm sure years from now I will still find elements in it
  that will grow even more on me with time. Best enjoyed while
  driving or relaxing at home (possibly with a little mary in tow,
  if you know what I mean), the songs fluctuate with peaks and
  valleys of highs and lows, and the beats are flawless, especially
  when compared to a lot of the mainstream garbage that is put out
  in the record industry on a regular basis. See the thing is that
  Shadow bases his music upon how he feels, and artists that do
  this correctly achieve an emotional reaction from their music
  that the true artists of our world truly achieve. Radiohead for
  example has a way of doing this, and it is not surprising then
  that one of DJ Shadows favorite artists is Radiohead, they both
  fuse these elements into their music, and achieve monumental
  status in my opinion. The package design is equally well done as
  well showing an artists eye for presentation, and a graffiti
  influenced design to the overall package. If you enjoy this album
  then I highly recommend any of Shadows works: Endtroducing,
  Preemptive Strike, The Private Press, and In Tune and On Time,
  which is a live set recorded in support of this album. UNKLE is
  also a well thought out album which bridges the gap between
  hip-hop, rock and techno, with guest appearences by Mike D of the
  Beastie Boys, Thom Yorke from Radiohead, and others from
  throughout the music industry. If you've never heard of DJ Shadow
  before, then I must say that you are missing out, if you are at
  all interested in underground music, do yourself a favor and pick
  up any of Shadow's albums or collaborations, I guarantee you will
  extremely impressed, as with any good album the songs have a way
  of growing on you over time. Peace out</Text>
  <Text category="music">Though I own alot of Paul Desmond
  recordings, this one as been in the CD changer for weeks now.
  There's great, gentle interplay with Jim Hall, and a total sound
  that is most enjoyable. Warm and round notes make this perfect
  evening music which I have found pleases most everyone</Text>
  <Text category="music">This music is undefinable ultimately. Oh
  yes, one can say parts sound like hard rock or progressive. One
  can say many things about it. For me, this, along with "Up the
  Downstairs" are probably their two best and they are both as
  different as night and day. I've become a collector of PT's stuff
  and like most of it very much indeed. Check out some of the side
  projects of the members in the band--like Blackfield and No-Man.
  They are worth good listenings too. But, you know, this wouldn't
  be a bad album to start your PT experience with. No, not at
  all</Text>
  <Text category="music">Jeff Beck is far from the typical rock
  guitarist. He never took the easy path of showing how fast or
  virtuoso he is. Instead, he is full of intriguing and explosive
  ideas that make you want to listen to this CD over and over
  again. That's what musicianship is all about, and Jeff has plenty
  of it</Text>
  <Text category="music">This cd is the funniest cd i own. The
  first half of the cd is pure comedy and super funny. The second
  half is a little hard to understand, and it louds like is was
  recorded poorly, that is why i gave it four stars. Track 2 is
  worth the money spent on the cd because that track is 8 mins of
  pure comedy. Eddie makes fun of Stevie Wonder and boxer Larry
  Holmes, and he does it well</Text>
  <Text category="music">This collection of Italian Cello Sonatas
  by the great Janos Starker is one of the most delightful chamber
  albums I own. The world renowned cellist was joined on this 1966
  recording by pianist Stephen Swedish on five of the selections,
  and by his frequent collaborator Gyorgy Sebok on the Bach Sonata
  in G minor, which was recorded in 1963 and added to this
  collection to increase its length (it is a welcome addition
  musically too). The selections here range from famous composers
  like Bach, Boccherini and Vivaldi, to the lesser known Corelli,
  Locatelli and Valentini. For me, the common thread of this
  recording is the passionate performances of Starker. Whether it
  is the happy bounce of the Vivaldi Allegro, the sublime rendering
  of the Boccherini Adagio, or the precise interplay with Sebok on
  the Bach Sonata, Starker plays masterfully and his cello is
  captured in rich, full sound by the Mercury Living Presence
  recording technique. This is an excellent purchase for all cello
  enthusiasts</Text>
  <Text category="music">Another solid 70's band that faded into
  obscurity. The nice thing about living in Canada was that we got
  to see all of the minor as well as the major acts. Edward Bear
  fell between the two. The original members got together in the
  late sixties and took their name from a more famous bear named
  Winnie. All of their hits are here as well as a cover of "Freedom
  for the Stallion" , a song that was also covered by "The Hues
  Corporation" and popularized by "Three Dog Night". Its mostly the
  type of music that most will remember a favourite love by from
  "The Last Song" to "Close Your Eyes" (I'm back again). A good
  middle of the road pop album to melt back the years</Text>
  <Text category="music">I love "Fool For The City" I have also
  always loved Savoy Brown "Looking In" and didn't know until
  recently that Lonesome Dave was the singer and most of the Savoy
  Brown band went on to form Foghat. If you are a Foghat fan you
  should check out "Looking In" by Savoy Brown. If you've heard
  other stuff by Savoy Brown and didn't like it, don't be
  discouraged because "Looking In" (and only "Looking In") is
  essentially Foghat. There were a lot of changes in Savoy Brown
  personnel through the years and the guys that did Looking In were
  the best.</Text>
  <Text category="music">I drive alot commuting to and from my job.

  <Text category="music">Joe Cocker has one of the most distinctive
  gravelly voices in R &amp;amp; B history. He's always stuck to
  his roots and never gone with temporary fads or novelties. This
  collection is another classic with great covers from the Beatles,
  Elton John and Gary Wright. His interpretive voice has always
  been the focal point of his songs, but in DTS 5.1, you are
  surrounded (as if in concert) by his presence. The completely
  adept and intuitive musicians that accompany him add more
  atmosphere without taking from his performance. Imagine hearing
  him in live in a theater and you'll know what to expect from this
  warm and heartfelt album</Text>
  <Text category="music">The Living In Oblivion series of CD
  compilations does something that many similar compilations do NOT
  do: they give us some great variety of "hits". There is no doubt
  that "Mickey" by Toni Basil was a huge hit. There's also no doubt
  that "Our Lips are Sealed" was a break out hit for the Go Go's,
  but the Funboy Three version wasn't. But what about "Living in a
  Box"? It only hit the Billboard top 100 at #89 in 1987. So why is
  it here? Why are a large number of these songs? They're not top
  10 hits, right? Wrong! I'm sick to death of so many compilations
  relying on top 40 hits from the 80's. The U.S. music tastes are
  typically very different from those of Europe. Just because a
  song doesn't make the U.S. Billboard top 40 doesn't mean that it
  isn't a hit in other countries. And although I'm an American, my
  music tastes have always run more in line with those of Europe.
  I'm delighted that the Living in Oblivion series (and the Pop and
  Wave series) have incorporated a variety of hits from the U.S.
  and Europe. I also like that some of the more obscure groups and
  their songs are available on these compilations. There are
  several songs on these albums that never were released on CD (as
  they hadn't come into being at the time of the groups' albums
  initial releases), so albums such as these are the only place
  where you can find these hits. The Boys Don't Cry song "I Wanna
  Be a Cowboy" hit the Billboard charts at #12 in 1986, but the
  group disappeared soon thereafter. Then all of a sudden a dance
  version of that same song came out in the early 2000's and
  rocketed up the dance charts. Don't be misled, the Living in
  Oblivion series is one of the absolutely best series for a
  variety of music from the 80's. If you want to hear run of the
  mill, top 40 only hits from the 80's, well, then you'll just have
  to look elsewhere. Also, the liner notes and pictures of the
  groups included in the jewel box are really clever. You get to
  find out what the chart position was for the songs in the
  compilation and see what the groups looked like at the time of
  the song's release. My only issue with these liner notes is that
  the author of them seems to be disparaging the very music which
  these albums are espousing. Apparently many believe that the
  music from the 80's was vacuous and devoid of emotion. One need
  only listen to the song "The Promise" by the group "When in Rome"
  (Living in Oblivion Volume 5) to know that such a statement is
  false. While that group only had this one hit and then faded into
  obscurity, "The Promise" made the Billboard Top 100 at #11 and
  the Billboard Dance Chart at #1. Anyway... I can't recommend this
  album and its entire series any more! It's simply awesome! Before
  believing those who would disparage this series of albums, please
  check the Billboard charts and you'll see that these songs were
  in fact hits. GET IT</Text>

  <Text category="music">A truly glorious recording, just what I
  want in music, with brilliancy, sensitivity, and beauty. This is
  a must have for every music lover worth the name</Text>
  <Text category="music">Her voice takes my breath away, I fell in
  love with her. I highly reccomend it</Text>
  <Text category="music">This is truly one of the great jazz albums
  of all time. Surprisingly, Evans' introspective style and
  Cannonball's soulful approach meld together perfectly. Perhaps
  this is testament to just how hugely talented these men are. Both
  The technical skill and pure musicmanship displayed on this
  record is just amazing. I've owned this CD for over 10 years now
  and still find so much to listen to in these recordings.
  Highlights are the amazing &amp;amp;quot;Waltz For
  Debby&amp;amp;quot; and Earl Zindars' waltz
  &amp;amp;quot;Elsa&amp;amp;quot;, easily one of the most
  beautiful songs ever written, in my opinion. You simply cannot go
  wrong with this CD</Text>
  <Text category="music">I remember thinking when this film came
  out that few things in life were as cool as Lloyd Dobler. This
  soundtrack is also one of those things. This album for me, as for
  many I'm sure, somewhat reflected my taste in music at the time,
  and even now actually. Of course the biggie here is "In Your
  Eyes" from Peter Gabriel. Who hasn't that track touched at some
  point? This also confirmed my love for the Red Hot Chili Peppers,
  and here we get a slightly extended version of their classic
  "Taste The Pain". Toss on a few from Fishbone, Living Colour, and
  The Replacements and you solidify this soundtrack as a must own
  for the late 80's alt-rock lover. Not to mention the goods from
  Depeche Mode and Nancy Wilson (Heart). In fact the only thing
  that could've made this album any better, is if it ended with a
  "ding"</Text>
  <Text category="music">This era of Tangerine Dream (TD) was just
  great. The Virgin Years were truly a great period for TD. For me
  it deals with space and landscape. It's so close to repetitive
  music that would come much later. It's also the one group that
  used rythm to structure these flying melodies. You could fly with
  them and end up with more in the end. You can't say that for too
  many of these Electronic groups. After that period they would go
  on with this ambient music that wasn't up to the same standards.
  It seems they are back (with other musicians of course) with the
  same kind of concept. Great! They were an important link on the
  electronic scene. A great album! A great period</Text>
  <Text category="music">Good Stuff! An excellent collection of
  original and classic gypsy jazz tunes, artfully performed by
  Jorgenson. I recommend it as an introduction to the virtuosity of
  John Jorgenson and the genius of Django Reinhardt</Text>
  <Text category="music">I would like to point out that MTV rocks
  is funny and you guys are suckers. This album does rule, just not
  as much as top40 radio hits</Text>
  <Text category="music">Let me the say that the vocals on this cd
  may be painful at first, yet you get over them very quickly,
  except for a few spots. Even so, they do not lower my score for
  the album, and at times are quite catchy. Savage - Good riffs,
  good solos, catchy, purely driven madness to start this insane
  album. 93/100 Where My Fortune Lies - the intro is absolutely
  nuts, and the highlight of the song. Probably my least favorite
  after this, yet the solos are still out of this world. 87/100
  Ninja - what a great song! The intro is one of the greatest
  things I have heard in my life, and this song may actually have
  you humming along at points. NINJA! Very well laid out, and the
  solos at the end are the best so far on the album. Brilliance.
  97/100 Concerto - Amazing once again, and Becker the 17 year old
  prodigy showcases himself throughout. He proves he is the master
  of sweeping and arpreggios all over this album, and this song is
  an insane instrumental that captures melodies like none other.
  More notes played in 4 1/2 minutes than in George Harrison's
  entire career. 98/100 Burn the Ground - fastest on the album solo
  wise in fact Becker is so fast it is hard to believe that its
  human. Very melodic too except when there are vocals, the song is
  kinda of disgusting. 87/100 Desert Island -another amazing song
  very well laid out with great solos and great riffs. The outro is
  the perfect intro to Speed Metal Symphony. The vocals are
  actually good on this song, like Ninja., an entertaining song.
  97/100 Speed Metal Symphony - nine minutes of shredding and
  arpreggios and all kinds of melodic madness that is beauty to any
  shredder's ears. Everything about this song is good. 97/100 There
  isn't much to say about this album except Becker and Friedman
  show they are true masters of their instruments and are able to
  play in a melodic and listenable way. I would recommend this over
  Yngwie Malmsteen, who has not improved since his first
  album</Text>
  <Text category="music">I'm not particularly familiar with Sonic
  Youth and the bits I've heard from their other albums haven't
  really grabbed me. This does. The rhythm section wouldn't be out
  of place in pseudo-tribal funk, the guitars are dissonant,
  jangling, sometimes hypnotically repetitive, and just plain
  weird, and the vocals are distant, airy, lazy. Some of the best
  music I've heard in a good long while</Text>
  <Text category="music">This is pure inspirational quintessential
  Oteil and the Peacemakers. It's Gospel, funk, jazz, rock...
  features his distinctive scatting and amazing bass, a wonderful
  blend of talent... glorious vocals... You will not regret this
  purchase... it's a joy all the way through from beginning to
  end..</Text>
  <Text category="music">i've been waiting for this one.this disc
  and this group period was funky.movin was one of the baddest
  instrumental jams that i've ever heard period.can you see the
  light is a tight jam as well.one of the many bad groups from back
  in the day</Text>
  <Text category="music">This film came out in 1973 and I saw it in
  its original full length version (about 3hours and 15 min.)
  Executives from Columbia Pictures were there, it was the
  premeire, and they were groaning and at the intermission fights
  broke out(verbal) and ushers passed among them and myself and
  everyone else with soundtrack albums. The executives left the
  theatre and scaled the albums across Columbus Circle in Boston
  and I and a few friends retrieved them and had quite a few for
  free. We returned to the film and I have always loved this crazy
  redition of Lost Horizon, the miscasting, the terrible sets, the
  odd ball music for the story, the dubbed Liv Ullmann, the dance
  routines of Olivia Hussey..all of it. You cannot find a musical
  like it, or a soundtrack like it. Columbia execs were
  unimaginative; they should have believed in this film. The next
  day after this premeire in Boston, New York etc. (simultaneous I
  suppose) the film was cut, the posters were taken down..there was
  a ton of material to buy..T Shirts, dolls, posters of all sizes,
  bath towels with the poster on them, records of the sd tk of
  course, and small pop up sets of the entire film. It was to be a
  massive hit..In two days time all of the paraphanalia was
  removed, and the posters said, Last Two Weeks, and in two weeks
  the whole thing disappeared. But many people came to see
  it..lines of people, and, when they heard it had been cut, they
  gave up, and in two weeks everyone said farewell to this film. I
  have many treasures from that opening nite, and now I have the CD
  of the sound track. Anyone who loves movie magic or madness has
  to see and hear this film; it is unique. Enjoy this soundtrack
  and get your hands on a DVD ..they are out there</Text>
  <Text category="music">Toad The Wet Sprocket have to be one of
  the most underated bands of the ninties. They wrote some
  brilliant material and a lot of the songs on this album are very
  enjoyable. BUT, there are some strange ones that are do not
  appeal to my taste. My fave song is 'Is It For Me'. It is hard to
  classify them though. It sort of deep and meaningful (at most
  times) pop rock. Other good tracks include Walk On The Ocean,
  Pray Your Gods and I Will Not Take...etc. I regard this album and
  'Dulcinea' as their two best albums</Text>
  <Text category="music">This is a glorious recording of one of the
  most lyrical, haunting scores ever composed for a film. Each
  succeeding track is a treat for the ears, refreshing and
  invigorating. Neeley and Varese Sarabande should be congratulated
  for recording and releasing this hirtherto neglected gem. In my
  opinion, though, the only part of the entire CD that doesn't work
  is the beginning of the "Waxworks" track - the score to this
  particular moment in the film (when Norma, watching herself
  onscreen, rises triumphantly to proclaim "I'll be up there again,
  so help me!") is one of the most powerful and recognizable images
  in filmdom. In the original, the music is strong, powerful and
  almost spine-tingling, but this moment on the CD is underwhelming
  and not fully realized. However, what is one misfire (totalling
  all of eight bars, at most) compared to the richness and texture
  of the rest of the recording?! In short, if you love film music,
  you most likely love the score to SUNSET BOULEVARD - and if you
  love SUNSET BOULEVARD, then you will most likely love this
  recording, too</Text>
  <Text category="music">Maiden had evolved into a new metal
  standard in 1986. Not only did they lead the metal world with the
  greatest artwork on covers, but their music took a new form and
  justifed everything they had done in the past. Iron Maiden to
  Powerslave were just the stepping stones to this standard
  classic. The CD Starts out with CAUGHT SOMEWHERE IN TIME, a
  galloping bassline, and parallel guitar make it, not only a
  classic, but ahead of its time. The rest of the CD id in pure
  form. My favorite track, however, is ALEXANDER THE GREAT. The
  intro starts out with a whisper of that era, and slowly builds to
  the howl of, I feel, the battle cry of the great warrior of
  History. Iron Maiden did not dissapoint with this CD. It is very
  well mixed and produced, and remains a standard in my collection
  of CD's.</Text>
  <Text category="music">I have been looking for a particular song
  for several years. This album had it</Text>
  <Text category="music">With Engines of Creation, Joe Satriani did
  what he has always done: make the most of the tools he chooses to
  use. Only this time, he uses electronic beats and soundscapes as
  the canvas on which to express his skill with the guitar. It
  would be easy to give this one listen and wonder where the guy
  who wrote "Satch Boogie," "War" and "Flying in a Blue Dream"
  went. Well, he's still here, only more than ever he's showing us
  his incredible command of his instrument by being able to create
  sounds that so perfecly reflect what they intend to convey. I've
  never heard robots having sex, but I'm willing to be "Borg Sex"
  isn't far off. And although his calmly passing, sometimes
  noodling melodies appear to have little structure, that's kinda
  how you'd expect to see "Clouds Race Across the Sky." The
  'chorus' to "Devil's Slide" sounds as sinister as its name
  suggests and "Attack" is as close to a musical sci-fi battle as
  I've ever heard. To top it off, the album includes "Until We Say
  Goodbye," one of Satch's best ballads in his entire catalogue. If
  you're willing to put a little more mental energy into
  appreciating the work Satch put into this album than just waiting
  for the album to rock your socks off Surfing With The
  Alien-style, you'll find that there's an incredible amount of
  depth -- and musicianship -- to be found. It's not a Satriani
  masterpiece, but its a true testament to the man's enduring
  creativity</Text>
  <Text category="music">His playing on this album reminds me of
  that of Bill Evans. I am glad to see on reading all the reviews
  that someone else had that exact thought. Comparison to Bill
  Evans is the best compliment I know how to give</Text>
  <Text category="music">I owned this as an LP and played it over
  and over on my tiny, mono phonograph. I loved it then and I love
  it now. Rainmaker, I'm On My Way Back Home and Love Is All That I
  Ever Needed would all have been sucessful singles. I Would Have
  Loved You Anyway is the only song I don't really like but the
  lyrics are unintentionally funny. All the lyrics seem more
  suggestive now than they did then but that's ok! The background
  singers get a tad tiring but Go David Cassidy! I don't care if
  it's the memories or not, I enjoy putting this on and turning it
  up</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">Excellent product! I really
  appreciate the option to choose any of the 50 given mystery cases
  to solve. After playing all 50, you can just start all over
  again! Fun, fun, fun game! THANKS</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">Very nicely done. Brought it for my
  grand-daughter who is 5yrs old and it is sturdy and has room to
  gro</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">My kids love this game. They sit down
  together and play this game all of the time. The neighbor kids
  come over to our house because they love to play board games and
  SORRY is the one they choose the most. We do not have video games
  at our house, and this was considered a drawback to the neighbor
  kids until my kids introduced them to board games. Now they come
  over all of the time just to play board games. I say hide the
  video games and let the kids interact with each other playing
  board games. Sorry is top game in our house</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">I bought this kitchen for my 18 mos.
  old and she really enjoys cooking and working in it. It is a
  nice, compact size that doesn't take up too much space. She can
  work at all the different stations and not get frustrated.
  Another bonus for me was that it came fully assembled and ready
  to use straight out of the box. My only complaint would be that
  the doors are somewhat difficult for my daugter to open, but I
  know as she gets older, it will become easier. I would definitely
  recommend this kitchen to anyone who in interested in purchasing
  one for their child</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">This kitchen is not the first one
  I've purchased. I am more happy with this one than the other two
  I have purchased. It has plenty of storage space for all the food
  and gives the child more doors to open and be more creative. I am
  very happy with this kitchen, it's durable and a good buy</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">Very pleased with this purchase... My
  2 yr. old daughter loves playing with her new kitchen! The
  kitchen came fully assembled and all plastic parts are very
  sturdy. The telephone is fun - and is actually my daughter's
  favorite part of the whole kitchen! I know of 4 other friends who
  have this same kitchen - and all are pleased with their
  purchase</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">My kids grew up overseas and are
  quite familiar with Renaissance paintings. They've seen many of
  these paintings and are very familiar with them. I realize this
  is not the typical situation. I was disappointed that the game is
  basically a game of luck. It is not challenging or reinforcing of
  our kid's knowledge. I had hoped for a game like "Famous Authors"
  which builds on and tests the level of knowledge of the players.
  Nonetheless, the game is well presented. It's on the expensive
  side, but the book alone is worth half the price. Looking for a
  fancy gift with cultural overtones? I recommend this</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">I received this game as a gift and it
  really is a great! The book that comes with it would have been a
  perfect 'Cliff Notes' for the Art History classes I had in
  school. My eight-year-old daughter won the first game we played
  and I'm re-learning lots of stuff I had forgotten. Highly
  recommended</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">My 16 month old loves her new
  groceries. The produce &amp;amp;amp;amp; sandwich parts are
  plastic &amp;amp;amp;amp; each piece has a wonderful texture. The
  canned goods are very interesting to read. They are actually
  labeled by a supermarket in the UK, so they are a bit different
  from the groceries you would find in the US. I put the cardboard
  frozen food items away until she is older. She has been
  entertained at length because each piece is so intricate. This
  was a great purchase.</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">This toy looks very appealing. I
  purchased this for my son, 16 months at the time thinking it
  would be a great toy to stash in the kitchen cupboard so he could
  play while I cooked cleaned etc. He played with it about 4 times
  total and he's 2 now! It doesn't do enough and does have much
  other than a shape sorter. I consider it wasted money but if my
  experience helps anyone I'm glad</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">Wonderful product. We bought this as
  a gift for my son's 7th birthday as a fun incentive to get him a
  little writing and spelling practice. He loved to make his own
  books at home with computer paper and the stapler, so a real book
  was a huge hit. He thought this was great because it is a real
  bound book with his own words and pictures. His book will be a
  cherished keepsake and I'm sure it will be great fun to look at
  when he is grown</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">I can't say enough about Illustory!
  My daughter is 6 and in Kindergarten and loved to make stories on
  paper stapled together. So, Santa brought her an Illustory kit
  and we did it together as she can't write many of the words yet.
  So, she drew all the pictures and told me what she wanted to
  story to say. We got our book in the mail yesterday, and she was
  so thrilled to see her story bound like a real book! The quality
  was great, and it even had the dedicaton page and an "about the
  author" page with her picture (which I provided). We even ordered
  an extra copy for grandma with a dedication to her! I highly
  reccomend this kit</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">An unexciting piece. Of value only to
  the completist collector (like myself). There's nothing wrong
  with it, it's just that there's nothing "great" about it either.
  The lauching projectiles are unnecessary for a "holographic"
  figure. Hasbro could has done better by choosing another "host"
  sculpt to base this exclusive off of. The "Phantom Menace"
  version was much better</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">Excellent product! I really
  appreciate the option to choose any of the 50 given mystery cases
  to solve. After playing all 50, you can just start all over
  again! Fun, fun, fun game! THANKS</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">I bought this for my 5 year old son
  for Christmas. Not only did he think it was great but also his 7
  and 9 year old sisters. There are so many games that there was
  something for all of them. We took the toy with us to Grandma's
  and even the older cousins found it very fun and entertaining. I
  really like that they can play all the games in Spanish too. Once
  they have got the hang of a game in English they can do it in
  Spanish and it helps increase their vocabulary. I was a little
  nervous if it would be worth the $50 because I had seen the
  barbie laptops and some others at radio shack. This one seemed
  like the best choice and was hoping this would be worth it. In my
  opinion it is much better than the others we tried in the store
  and I would definately recommend it</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">Just purchased this for my 7 year old
  son that has cerebral palsey- He only has use of his right hand-
  this cartridge is perfect- game does not allow mistakes and can
  play this cartridge with only one hand and not both. Since my son
  has use of only one hand he has trouble playing the other vsmile
  games- he's hooked. Is very engaging also where some of the other
  games fall short</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">This is really fun for adults. We get
  together once a month and we really enjoy the company, the food
  and the spirits. This was meant for adults to solicize not for
  children. I am sure they might learn somehting at another
  gathering. I have really enjoyed Bunco.</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">We have enthusiastically played Candy
  Land with each of our three kids. It is easily the best starting
  point for introducing a child to board games. Players take turns
  drawing from a deck and moving their pieces around the board. The
  cards have one or two squares of a particular color (such as red,
  green, yellow, etc.) and players move pieces ahead on the path to
  the next matching spot of the same color. No counting or reading
  is required. There are also special cards that can move a player
  ahead or behind, and they are indicated by picture of the spot on
  the board to which the player should move their piece. Play
  continues until one player reaches the end. Some of my
  observations: 1) Most kids can probably start playing and
  enjoying this game before the recommended 36 months of age. If
  you have a child with the attention span and the desire to sit
  down for a 10-15 minute game, I'm pretty confident they could
  enjoy it. 2) Among the lessons our kids learned from CandyLand:
  taking turns, recognizing colors, and dealing with
  disappointment. Luckily, the games are quick enough that it is
  usually possible to play multiple games in one seting. This makes
  it possible to keep playing until each child has had at least one
  win. (Very helpful for managing little egos) 3) For such a simple
  game, it manages to perfectly balance the possibility of changes
  in fortune without seeming arbitrary. The game is literally in
  doubt until the last card is played (one of the "special" cards
  might send a player back to near the start). This is great for
  teaching that most valuable of lessons: "NEVER give up". 4) With
  most simple games, it is almost impossible to get older kids to
  play after they reach a certin age. We have not found that to be
  as true with Candy Land. We've had games with an adult and kids
  ages 3, 6, and 9 playing together and having fun. If you have
  more than one kid, you know how hard this can be. As a parent of
  three, I give this game my highest recommendation</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">I bought this for my three year old
  godson last Thanksgiving, and he loved it. The pieces are bright,
  sturdy, and easy to grasp with tiny hands. I've purchased several
  Melissa and Doug products, and I've never been
  disappointed</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">My son love this toy. It also
  reenforces this shapes and colors. it's a stepping stone for
  geometric patterns</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">This toy is so much fun! I play with
  it every day with my sister &amp;amp; brother. Altogether we have
  about 50 LPS. I have the most</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">Both girls, ages 4 and 2 loved
  this</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">This game has no board therefore no
  time is wasted trying to move from one room to another to make
  accusations. The luck in this game depends on which sleuth cards
  you draw rather than rolls of the dice. Strategy is the same as
  the original game only game play moves more quickly with one
  being able to gather information on nearly every turn they have.
  Sometimes you can actually eliminate more than one item on your
  list during your turn. All in all, this is a fun game that you
  can play over and over again in an evening with out getting bored
  with it</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">I always thought Clue looked like a
  complicated game I'd never touch! That is until I played it at my
  friends house! Now I'm a Clue fanatic trying to collect all the
  versions! This game can never get old because it's a different
  outcome every time! I strongly reccomend it to anyone 8 and
  older</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">This is an extremely fun and
  addictive game. You shuffle the cards, and place three (room,
  weapon, person) in the secret envelope. In every room you go
  into, you can make accusations. If someone has the card you
  accused (like the room), then they show it to you and you write
  it down on your notepad. The game changes constantly, so it never
  gets boring. The character pieces have teeny details, like Mr.
  Green has straps and buckles on his briefcase. I gave it 4 stars
  for education because it teaches you to focus and really THINK.
  Oh, and good problem-solving skills too. And coordination (you
  have to add all the clues up to see who did it). All in all, a
  terrific game. Great for rainy days or playdates. And did I
  mention the weapons? Very realistic. And cute</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">This little motorcycle is cute.
  However, it's very lightweight and is similar in quality to a
  ride-on toy that could be purchased for much less at any discount
  retailer. The stickers do seem to be of high quality and to date,
  none have peeled off. The extreme shipping price added another
  $10 to the $19.99 price tag. This is definately not a $30
  toy.</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">I-Dog is so fun to use! All you have
  to do is plug the included cable into your digital player's
  headphone port and I-Dog will play your music through a tiny
  internal speaker. I-Dog's face will light up with various
  patterns and colored lights depending on what type of music you
  play. His tail serves as a mute button, but be careful because he
  doesn't like you touching too often! I-Dog will get sad if you
  don't give him any music to listen to. If you don't have a
  digital player, you can set I-dog by your boombox or other music
  device and he can "hear" that way. There are only two reasons why
  I didn't give I-Dog 5 stars: (1) The internal speaker isn't very
  loud, so you have to have your music player turned up quite high,
  and (2) the battery cover on I-Dog's back leg is really hard to
  get off. You will definitely need some kind of tiny screwdriver
  to get it off</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">My 3 year old is very interested in
  space and LOVES this toy. Having said that one has to make sure
  that her child plays carefully with it----the payload doors don't
  really close, the robotic arm is a bit hard to use and the
  satellite dish on the truck is difficult to put back on. Meets
  the need for a realistic shuttle, though</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">This is a must have for your little

  she'd rather use stuff from Mommy's purse. ;) The purse is oh so
  cute too, and durable. My daughter is 21 months old, she received
  this on Christmas and has been a favorite since.</Text>

  <Text category="toys_games">Purchased the Batman Laptop Computer
  at Target for Christmas for my grandson who is not quite 5 years
  old. He was totally drawn in because it is Batman....but the
  games kept his interest. The entire family enjoyed trying the
  different games. Dad, a musician, enjoyed the music game.
  Graphics are super... I love the way Batman gives his approval
  with a thumbs up when you get the answer right....and the cool
  light inside that allows you to adjust from green to red. Grandma
  played in the dark with grandson for fun even. Worth the $38.99 I
  paid at Target on sale for sure.</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">Just wanted to let others know this
  info that I found out after reading the tip given by the reviewer
  about getting the table for a lot cheaper at Costco ... I called
  Costco and they carried the KIDKRAFT art table with two stools
  back in January of 2006, and will no longer be carrying it. You
  can find it at Walmart for $66 plus shipping, just check the
  website. The table is not the same however -- the dimensions are
  different, the sides of the tables is slightly different (on one
  side of the Kidcraft table has two cups and a mesh basket in
  between the two cups, and the other side has a space where little
  legos can snap onto). The stools are also tiny compared to the
  ones that come with this table. Overall it looks a little less
  substantial, but since I haven't seen it in person, I really
  can't give my opinion. Hope that helps someone</Text>

  <Text category="toys_games">My seven month old thinks the pots

  my head when I'm trying to sleep</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">I bought this set for my son who
  loves to draw and paint. He absolutely loved this set. The colors
  are wonderful and the different types of pens, paints and crayons
  make drawing alot more fun for him. The case is sturdy and great
  so he doesn't lose anything. The price can't be better for
  everything you get.</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">I am so glad I bought this puzzle for
  my 3 year old! The pieces have the most beautiful pictures on
  them and the larger sized pieces are just right for toddler
  hands. This is one of those toys that you'll want to keep
  forever</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">It is really expensive for what it
  is. I have to say my children love it, esspecially since we can
  put it in the middle of the table and everyone can take what they
  need from it. I love that when we are done you can put everything
  back and stick it on a shelf. However, for the supplies you get
  it IS expensive. The tote itself is nice but not worth more than
  $5, add the supplies to it, maybe I could see spending $10.
  However, if you catch it on sale I would pick up a few, they make
  great gifts</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">I BOUGHT THIS FOR MY 3 YEAR OLD
  DAUGHTER. SHE LOVED IT IN THE STORE AND I THOUGHT IT WAS CUTE. I
  ALSO AGREE WITH THE OTHER REVIEWERS THAT THERE SHOULD BE
  INSTRUCTIONS FOR THE STICKERS, BUT YOU DON'T NEED TO BE A GENIOUS
  TO FIGURE OUT WHERE THEY GO. I CHOSE TO NOT SHAROEN THE PENCIL
  BECAUSE SHE IS 3 AND I DIDN'T THINK IT WAS NECESSARY. FOR TWENTY
  DOLLARS IT IS A GOOD BUY. I KNOW MY DAUGHTER LOVES IT AND IS
  HAVING A LOT OF FUN WITH IT</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">Very interesting spoof of the
  original game. I found the first one boring after a few plays,
  but this one still interests my kids and I after 10+ plays. It's
  a bit convoluted to put it together initially, but well worth
  it</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">I always thought Clue looked like a
  complicated game I'd never touch! That is until I played it at my
  friends house! Now I'm a Clue fanatic trying to collect all the
  versions! This game can never get old because it's a different
  outcome every time! I strongly reccomend it to anyone 8 and
  older</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">Every child should have a chance to
  play this game at least once in their lifetime. The characters on
  the game board are so awesome too. Queen Frosting (that was her
  name... right?) is so pretty, she was always my favorite
  character. All in all, it's a great game and a great gift for
  nearly any child</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">We had so much fun with this game.
  There are truth or dares and all sorts of fun questions! I
  definatly recommend this game if you are having a party or even
  just a few people who want to have a good time! Totally worth
  buying this one</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">I agree with the other reviewer that
  this is more like a shape sorter than a kitchen. My daughter
  loved it when she was 1. Now she's turned 2 and she's lost
  interest in it, like many other "baby toys". I had to get her a
  larger and more realistic toy kitchen so she can "cook" with
  it</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">This was a great buy from Amazons
  sale rack at five dollars and 29 cents plus free shipping. My
  [...] just loves puzzles and we are certainly fond of Melissa and
  Doug products. We normally purchase them from Tuesday Morning or
  our local hobby store because they are usually cheaper. This
  puzzle has made my toddler happy. He fits it together then dumps
  it, repeating the process several times a day. The drawing is
  realistic and there are no pegs, so it gives a little more grown
  up feel to the piece.</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">I got this message from the
  recipient's mother: He loves it, really! well-made drawer - shelf
  design. It's heartwarming when he settles down industriously
  using his art supplies</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">My 9 year old son just started to
  understand this game, we bought it when he was 7. He would get
  confused on how to call out the other persons ships. He would say
  where his ships were. This game helps kids understand they need
  to pay attention and coordinate where their ships are. It depends
  on how quick your kids pick things up if they would enjoy playing
  this game.</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">I thought that this would be toy my
  daughter would grow into and not be excited about at first. This
  was the first toy she opened at Christmas at only 19 months and
  was not interested in any others for the rest of the week! She
  enjoyed collecting the fingers and and "counting" them. She also
  has grown in the last few months to putting the puzzle together
  herself although the fingers might not make it on the correct
  hand just yet. Very durable, love that it is a traditional wood
  toy that doesn't have flashing lights or needs batteries! She
  still loves it months later. The only downside to any toy like
  this, is we have to collect the pieces after she has put them in
  various places around the house.</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">My 3 years old son like's it but
  put's it together in no time. Not so hard</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">This puzzle is a lot of fun and my
  son loves it. The container is a toy for itself</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">My 28 month old son got this puzzle
  for Christmas and loves it. He put it together the first time out
  of the box himself. It is the first thing he does every morning
  and then several times a day. My almost 5 year old likes it too.
  It is not as sturdy as the Melissa &amp;amp; Doug floor puzzles,
  but it still really sturdy.</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">A lot of people look at this figure
  and say 'he has no wings!'.While this is true,I still recommend
  this toy,an excellant hair sculpt and goku's famous 'I have no
  idea what's going on, but be happy anyway!'look.The wings are
  actually really cool,although the halo has a job staying
  on.0verall this is a great toy and a definate purchase for any
  dbz fan or toy collector</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">My Grandson has truly enjoyed the
  Easyscore Basketball Set from the first day he tried it.
  Wonderful to have the adjustment for heightening as he
  grows.</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">i got this toy for my nephew and i
  know he will get alot of good years out of it.</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">This made our 6 year old so happy!
  Great colors, great markers</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">This set is perfect for a younger
  child! Having 100 markers to work with is great. I know when I
  was younger, I loved having little carrying cases for eveything
  to keep organized...I wish I had had this cute little case when I
  was 5</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">These dogs are adorable and are a
  cute addition to the dollhouse set. My daughter sends the other
  pets outside to play with this set. Plays with them as much as
  the people. Great addition</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">This deck is amazing the best
  structure deck out there. I'm a warrior fan so i loved it. its
  great for begginers just add the e-heroes and its perfect!</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">We got this as an 11th birthday
  present for one of my daughter's friends. It was the hit of the
  birthday party -- all the girls went home with new yarn belts,
  and my daughter, who can already knit a little, asked if she
  could have one, too. The colors of yarn are bright and the
  texture is easy to work with. For our purposes, this was a great
  birthday present</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">This was exactly what I was looking
  for to complete my little set</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">Bertie is nice. He has no magnetic
  pieces so he won't hook to other things. Nice 16month old tries
  to use him on the train track which does work but he wasn't
  really meant for that and can be hard to push on the track</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">My two year old has several of these
  cars, and the race track. He loves all things Cars, so these were
  a big hit. All of the Shake and Go Cars talk before they run,
  which he especially likes. They are VERY easy for a toddler to
  operate, but his four year old sister enjoys playing with them,
  too. They don't run for very long per shake, but that doesn't
  seem to bother him at all</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">This board is of excellent quality
  and is highly transportable, but a little small for Go players
  who play avidly. The stones are also small, but they get the job
  done. Why I bought this board was because I wanted to be able to
  take it with me, without a huge board dragging me down. This fits
  what I want almost perfectly. Thanks</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">When my 25 year old daughter sat down
  to play Wedgits with her younger siblings, she declared that she
  wanted a set for Christmas. She thinks it will be a great coffee
  table game for all her college friends. My friend got a set for
  her grandkids but when the family gets together her son and
  son-in- law monopolize them with their little competitions. These
  are wonderful for the imagination, and with Wedgits you will have
  a toy that adults will enjoy playing with and that makes the
  children very happy</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">Both my 4 &amp;amp; 2 year olds love
  the wedgits, my 4 year old however really gets into it. She loves
  to try and make what the pictures tell her. I was surprised at
  how good she was it. It really holds her interest</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">This was the best therapy game ever.
  My girls bought it for me, a gift because I love board games. We
  mostly played it with their friends. I have played with my
  children several times and found out some very interesting views
  that they have about me. I decided to bring it to a family
  gathering. I have always been distant with my eight siblings. The
  game started out with the kids and my sisters ect. then when they
  saw I was ok with laughing at myself they asked the children to
  leave and just the sisters played. We had a total awakening of
  how we see each other. We have never been closer, since that game
  our communication has been wonderful. This game is the best. We
  laughed so hard we ached the next day. We played till 2:00 a.m.
  Our husbands kept calling us asking when we were going be home.
  We started our game at 9:00 p.m. and told them we'd just be an
  hour or two. LOL I have been instructed to bring the game to this
  Summers get-together</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">My 2 year old daughter loves these
  dolls and I like them because you can't remove their clothes or
  shoes! Very cute and durable dolls</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">My cousin loves these dolls. She
  loves that she gets to be a "little mommy" to a boy AND
  girl...that's what i love about this set...plus the dolls are
  adorable and the only thing I don't like about them is the hats.
  I wish the hats were...cuter? I don't know but it doesn't matter.
  I'd buy these dolls for any really little girl. She used to cry
  when she lost accessories for her other dolls...but at least with
  these there isn't much to lose</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">It seems that just about every house
  in our subdivision has an electric ride-on toy. There are few
  "Barbie" Jeeps, few polaris ATVs, one Corvette and three Gators
  and few others. My 4 year old daughter was the first Gator owner.
  I must say, it is expensive.. This thing is by far the most
  expensive toy my daughter has, bar none. Should you buy your 4
  year old $300 ride-on toy? Well... that's up to you. But she
  loves her gator. She had to give up on lot of other toys to get
  this one, but she is extremely happy with it. Sometimes I wish I
  was 40lbs so I can ride this thing. She can't care less about the
  "barbie" thing, so this green utility machine was fine with her.
  The gator is slightly faster than others and the fat tires and
  truck bed makes the gator looks a lot more serious than the
  Barbie jeep. The truck bed is really useful. Although not
  recommended, she hauled two kids on the bed. With 4 kids on the
  car, it still zoomed around the street quite well. One time I
  loaded nail gun, air compressor, electric drill and jigsaw and
  panel saw all on the bed and asked my daughter to drive to the
  other side of the yard to fix the fence. I saw our neighbor
  hauling few bags of mulch on theirs. It made such a funnt scene..
  little electric toys carrying real tools and stuff. Very cute.
  Enough of fun stuff. Problem 1. Battery location and the hassle
  to recharge this thing. You have to open the front grill and
  sometimes the latch can pinch your finger. It hurts. Problem 2.
  The left front wheel fell off while my daughter was driving it. I
  tightened it again and never happened. Problem 3. Slipping tires.
  People complain about the tires having very low friction. They
  slip very easily on driveway and grass. But this is how it
  "protects" its gearbox so I don't really care, but I heard they
  are expensive once they wear out. I think this is the best
  ride-on toy on the market today. If extra $[...] won't hurt you
  too much, then do consider the gator. Your children will not be
  disappointed.</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">We got this toy for my son when he
  was 2 1/2 years old he is now 4 years old. It still runs like
  new. He drives it like a champ. We have used it to haul mulch to
  the back yard and some yard bricks. It never fails us and he
  think he is a big helper which he is. I am thinking of buying a
  2nd one for my younger son now.</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">The doll looks nothing like the Aidan
  in the movie. Actually, his face is kind of funny looking. The
  movie Aidan is cuter. The doll could definitely have been made
  better</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">My son got these blocks when he was 2
  for christmas. he is now 4 and 1/2 and still playing with them.
  It seems no matter what new toy he has gotten, every morning I
  hear him carrying out his bucket of these megabloks. I only wish
  they came is a larger quantity.</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">I ought this for my daughter for her
  1st birthday. She loves the bead maze at the top and she goes
  round and round the cube exploring all the different sides! So as
  the title would suggest, the stickers on the cog wheels are
  starting to come off (after 1 week). This doesnt affect the
  functionality of the toy, just the aesthetics. If you are not
  bothered by some bare cogwheels this is still a great toy! It
  stands 2 feet tall to the top of the maze and is the perfect
  height for little ones. The other 3 sides are: ABC with pictures
  rotating blocks, Abacus, Sliding plastic pegs. The only side with
  stickers is the cog wheels so no worries about other sides losing
  stickers. If they had made the cog wheels out of wood or had the
  design painted or imprinted into the plastic this toy would be a
  10</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">The checkbook package was opened. No
  pieces were missing. But It was hard to glue the plastic to the
  cardboard to give it as a Christmas gift</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">I bought this for my grandson, and he
  no sooner got it out of the box (with help), and he was outside
  in the sand with it, having a great time. Cannot lose with these
  oversized trucks for little hands. It is a good purchase</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">My son, who is 3, loves dinosaurs and
  everything green. This toy was perfect. The dinosaur comes in
  Green and Red. I bought green for my son and gave the red one to
  his cousin. They have dino wars. This dinosaur moves, roars, and
  flashes its eyes red, which looks really cool in the dark. My son
  flys it around the room &amp;amp; uses it to attack other toys.
  This proved to be a such agreat toy, I bought another (#2) green
  dino to have my son and husband have dino fights. This toy is the
  best I have found.</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">This toy was bought for my son (14
  months) because he has an obsession with the phone. My son
  instantly LOVED this toy and has been a great subsitute when he
  is reaching for the phone and I'm on it. It is a great travel toy
  as well. Being in the armed forces, we are constantly on the move
  and he loves sitting in his car seat on the rides and playing
  with his phone. Sure this toy gets a bit old after a bit but it's
  a small price to pay for your kids true happiness. My one gripe
  with this phone is that within two days of him playing with it,
  he broke the center button that flips the features. We returned
  it to the store and have not been able to find it except online.
  I'm sure it was just a fluke flaw and am buying it again</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">this is an awesome game. the fun
  thing about it is building it. its better than the rollercoasters
  because you dont just watch it going in circles. it actually does
  stunts. its also not so easy to. its VERY!!!!!!!!!!!!! DURABLE.
  JUST KEEP IT AWAY FROM BABIES. YOU HAVE TO ORDER IT OFF THE
  INTERNET SO DONT GO LOOKING FOR IT AT STORES. OVERALL ITS AN
  EXCELLENT TOY</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">I purchased the mat to use with it
  and it works great</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">My son got this for his 5th birthday
  and he loves it! He likes to turn off the lights and give "shows"
  for the family. We have not listened to the Cds yet but I am sure
  they are a great add-on. My son is fascinated by space adn this
  porjector was a cool way for him to learn even more. I don't know
  if they revamped the design or someting but we love it and have
  no complaints. In fact, we are going to purchase some of the
  other packs available</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">This game set it of amazing quality.
  Every piece has so much detail it just looks good without doing
  anything! The Dubloons are the best part, and like others have
  said, make the BEST clinking sound when you drop a pile into your
  hand. This game is definately worth buying.... IF you come up
  with some new rules that make the game more interesting. The
  gameplay is very uninteresting, boring, and brainless. My wife
  never passes up an opportunity to tell me how boring it was, and
  even her younger (12 year old) sister thought it was boring and
  had more fun playing with the pieces. My wife says I should have
  bought us Settlers of Catan instead of spending my money on this
  (before we got our own set... now we have one), but when I bought
  it I knew it would be just for the game pieces. I am brewing up
  some good rules to change the gameplay dramatically and make it
  much more interesting. She likes Settlers so much.. maybe I will
  get some trade of spices into the game and whatnot. Anyways, if
  you are creative and have a good idea for a ship game, then
  DEFINATELY get this game set. It is high quality and beautiful.
  But, if you don't have the interest to make your own game, then
  pass this one up because you would most likely love to play any
  other game you own before this</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">The item arrived in perfect condition
  and right when I was told it would be here. I am very happy with
  this product and seller. Would have no problem doing busy with
  them agai</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">The story of "Hansel and Gretel" is
  more than a warning against children talking to strangers (or
  trying to eat their houses). The recurring image of the forest in
  German fairy tales is a supernatural world where interesting
  things happen, while the fact the father of Hansel and Gretel is
  a woodcutter is significant because this was one of the lowliest
  occupations at that time. Therefore, what we have here is the
  triumph of the poor working class characters over the witch and
  her upper class pretentions (she stores not only treasure but
  food), which would make her death some sort of proto-Marxist
  warning if you are ideologically inclined in that direction. In
  the original manuscript of the story of the siblings were
  referred to as Little Brother and Little Sister. The Brothers
  Grimm chose Hansel because it was a common name in German fairy
  tales (their equivalent of John Doe so to speak) and picked
  Gretel for essentially the same reason (which makes her Jane
  Doe). Gretel (or Gretchen) is a form of the name Margaret, which
  in Latin (Margarita) means "pearl." All that background makes it
  rather ironic that for its Twisted Fairy Tale series McFarlane
  Toys has turned Gretel into a German princess, striking a pose
  that suggests "Getting lost in the woods is the least of her
  worries." This six-inch figure has tattoos, a spiked collar
  around her neck, and torn fish net stockings. There are more
  details for you to discover when you look over the figure
  carefully, and while she is not exactly a princess of bondage,
  Gretel appears to be familiar with the neighborhood. She also has
  a mop and a pail, and there is ample reason to think she knows
  how to use them (the mind reels at the possibilities for
  rewriting the Grimms tale). Twisted Fairy Tales is the fourth
  series of McFarlane's Monsters, and the rest of the menagerie
  consists of not only Gretel's tag team partner Hansel, but Red
  Riding Hood, Peter Peter Pumpkin Eater, and Little Miss Muffet.
  If you were aware about the probable origins of a lot of the
  classic fairy tales then you already knew that Mother Goose had a
  twisted sense of humor. With these figures McFarlane Toys
  certainly takes being twisted to the next level. Even if you do
  not want the entire set, there should be one of these figures
  that captures the Jungian dark side of the tales that we were all
  raised on once upon a time that most appeals to you</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">The wagon is great, as expected. 5
  stars for the wagon, no stars for delivery. It arrived with a
  dent, though, and when we called they told us a replacement
  wouldn't be available until mid-February, plus we'd have to
  figure out how to re-pack the thing, which was halfway assembled
  before we noticed the dent . . . so we gently banged it out and
  spray-painted the spot, and the recipients probably won't care,
  but it was a pain-in-the-butt, and there didn't seem any way to
  deal with it that wouldn't have been too much trouble.</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">I got a wagon like this when i was
  really small. Now I am 14 and Istill use it for getting grocries
  from the store. It is still in good condition except it is rusty
  because i used to fill it with water nd make my friends ride in
  it. It is fun to ride down the hill from the store too my home.
  It can go really fast and it's easy to steer. You have to be
  careful if you cross the road and go onto a curb with kids in it.
  One time my mom was pulling me and my sister to the store. When
  she went over the curb it tipped over and my sister scraped
  underneath her nose. It is a great toy and even though i'm too
  old for it i still like it a lot</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">I had a Radio Flyer wagon just like
  this as a child and loved it, which is why I wanted one for my
  daughter. We bought ours when our daughter was a year old, and
  she loved being pulled around the neighborhood in it. Now that
  she's four, she loves pulling her one-year-old little brother
  around, or posing for pictures with him in it. We use it for
  picnicing in the local park, or setting up an impromptu lemonade
  stand on the front lawn. The wagon seems to keep popping up in
  our family photos, from the Labor Day block party to Halloween
  trick-or-treating. It's a &amp;amp;quot;classic&amp;amp;quot; for
  good reason--kids love it, and never stop loving it</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">My son received this as a christmas
  gift, and thoroughly enjoys it. This is not a regular DVD. It is
  designed to go with the "Read With Me DVD" system (a separate
  remote control that works with it on your TV). A previous
  reviewer was not aware of this, so it should not have received a
  bad review for consumer error</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">My 2 year old grandson loves balls of
  any kind,when I found this activity set I knew he would really
  enjoy it,he plays with it for hours. The only downside of this is
  that he cannot keep up with the balls. It would be great if this
  company would give parents,or grandparents an order form to get
  replacement balls to give this fun toy longer life</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">I bought this for my son's second
  Christmas; he was almost 2. It was a recommendation of one of my
  parenting magazines and I had to hunt it down 3 years ago. He
  loved pounding the balls and he even could match the color of the
  ball to the color of the hole! He still plays with it and I will
  be buying his baby brother one when he's big enough</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">My 18-month old has been playing with
  this for three months now and just loves it. She even knows now
  which color balls goes in the correct slot. She whacks them all
  in, puts the balls back, and keeps doing this over and over and
  over</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">My 5 year old twins really like this
  game...it is sometimes difficult to balance the toppings, but
  that is why they like it so much. On the other hand, my 3 year
  old finds it very frustrating. If you are considering purchasing
  this for a younger child you can rough up the pizza part with a
  piece of sand paper to help with the slippage.</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">My son loves these! They arrived in
  perfect condition. LOVE that they are machine washable</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">My sister said her 3yo son loved and
  and was able to play in it with his 1yo brother! I don't really
  know how durable it is, she lives in another state but said they
  liked it alot</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">My eight and nine year old sons are
  big Lego fans. I bought one set for each of my boys and they each
  built a different model. Both models came out great. The parts
  fit together beautifully and the finished product moves very well
  when played with. The vehicles are even better than they look in
  the pictures on the box. This was the first Technic set that they
  tried. I hope they enjoy future Technic sets as much</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">If your child likes the Wiggles like
  my 2 year-old does, then she'll love this keyboard. Except that
  there is no volume button, which I consider rude to the parents.

  <Text category="toys_games">My 23-month old son received this toy
  for Christmas and it was one of his favorites. He played with it
  off and on for hours. Woke up this morning and ran right to it.
  It isn't very educational but the fact that he recognizes the
  songs from the show makes it more fun. It's not too bulky so it's
  something we can take in the car. Overall, we love it and would
  recommend it to any Wiggles fan ;-</Text>

  <Text category="toys_games">I have wanted to buy a Musini for my
  son for a few years now, but never found one in a retail store,
  online or local. I recently gave in and bought one gently used on
  eBay for a fantastic price including the cartridge. My entire
  family LOVES it, including my 2-year-old son. It was very easy to
  figure out how to use, even without a manual. On the battery case
  are very clear, easy to follow instructions on how to calibrate
  the sensitivity of your Musini. Within minutes we had found the
  perfect setting for our carpeted living room and we were all
  dancing. Even my parents who came to visit one night were bopping
  to the Musini! My dad couldn't keep his feet still, insisting on
  drumming them on the floor constantly to keep the music going
  when my toddler had taken a seat to rest for a minute. I have
  found myself taking it out during my son's nap time to put near
  me while I do the mundane chores around the house. It is really
  addicting and keeps us all moving! I can't say enough good things
  about this toy. The music quality is absolutely wonderful and is
  clear and crisp and a joy to listen to. You also tend to feel
  like you are actually playing an instrument when you're dancing
  around or even sitting on the floor tapping your fingers. The
  songs are mostly familiar and well-loved songs that you will
  instantly recognize. I have also noticed that you can use the
  Musini to up your child's physical activity. If you change the
  sensitivity so that they must jump or stomp hard, you suddenly
  have an even greater outlet for energy and a great source of
  exercise! You can, of course, adjust the sensitivity so that a
  single finger tap across the room will register. It's up to you,
  and I think it's fantastic! Highly recommended</Text>

  loves it. This toy was perfect</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">We had a simpler and earlier
  Quercetti marble run. This was an upgrade/add-on, and well worth
  it. The motorized elevator keeps the action going. A five year
  old will need help setting up, but can operate the final run
  easily. Safe pieces, easy construction and good directions. Fun,
  even for the adults</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">Gave this to my 6 year old for his
  birthday. I helped him to construct it from the clear (no
  reading) directions along with my 10-year old daughter. The
  pieces go together flawlessly - the engineering of the plastic is
  superb. The elevator works as designed and the battery pack
  (2xAA) connects via a short cord - very convenient. He has
  already spent many hours playing with it</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">Our three children, who are now in
  their forties, were young when we purchased a Bozo Bop Bag for
  them. They loved it, used it all the time, and it held up
  beautifully through the years. Now our daughter has a daughter of
  her own and we purchased one for her. Same design, same wonderful
  quality, same use as forty years ago. Bozo is a "friend" who
  likes to be punched so he can bounce back up. Our 3 year old
  grand daughter loves him. She now has a baby sister 7 months old
  who will also be able to make use of Bozo. For toddler activity
  and appropriate "acting out", I thoroughly recommend this product
  with no reservation. It's a bit pricey, but worth 5 stars for
  sure</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">I looked for years to get the Bozo
  punching bag as it was a part of my youth. Finally I located it
  and purchased it for my grandson, 7. He loves it as does all of
  his family who use it to take out their frustrations. LOL Built
  very sturdy as he drags it around the backyard as well</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">I received this sudoku handheld for
  christmas as a gift. I started to get into sudoku a few months

  push to make it work. hope this helps</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">Love this new edition to Yatzee. It
  is so handy to have the tray so your dice don't go flying
  everywhere. This game is really a good game for the whole
  family</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">Its the best table out there. I did a
  lot of research and now have a year of "testing." We bought it
  for my daughter when she was 1, and she's almost 3. I also run a
  daycare. The chairs don't tip and various ages from 2-5 have put
  them to their worst. It cleans easily and is easy to put aside,
  if needed. I did have to replace a chair once (I stood on it.)
  and the customer service was fast and friendly.</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">We did not buy the refill but
  purchased the original set with sandbox. It works wonderfully and
  my kids have played with it for hours. Clean up is easy. Another
  family I know just used theirs for the 1st time and they also had
  a wonderful experience.</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">This large collection of lego bricks
  is to my mind the "classic collection". Children of all ages (and
  adults) can build ships, planes, houses -- whatever the mind
  imagines -- in a variety of colors. The bricks come in a nice
  sturdy plastic container for convenient storage. While Lego has
  gone on to develop a wide range of other products, for those who
  want a good starter kit and bricks not specific to any particular
  image or character, this is a great product</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">FINALLY - a way to buy just the Lego
  bricks to build using your imagination. I only have one, but no
  more "kits" for me!! Even the Lego company on line doesn't have
  this one! Highly recommended</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">This figure of the great Wayne
  Gretzky is a must-have for those who collect hockey memorabilia.
  The figurine is life-like, with Gretzky's expression looking just
  as it did whenever he scored a goal. What I love most about this
  toy is that you can purchase Gretzkys that wore different jerseys
  to represent the eras in hockey his playing career spanned. If
  you are like me and collect Gretzky memorabilia (pictures, cards,
  jerseys, etc), this is an artifact that will fit quite nicely in
  your collection.</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">Since I had always wanted a "mad
  scientist" lab when I was a girl and never got one, my husband
  purchased this for my 4 1/2 yr old son and I to do together.
  Overall, it's been fun. Everything but water has been included
  which is a plus. The "lab" comes with interlocking pieces which
  can be assembled in a variety of ways. I like this component
  because it helps children with problem solving, creativity and
  motor skills. The kit also comes with recipie cards and its own
  measuring spoon and beaker. It's really taught my son to learn
  how to measure. However, the recipie cards tend to generalize and
  direct you to refer to other recipie cards, which my son would
  not be able to figure out without my help. The steps on the cards
  come with both words and pictures which was a plus but they
  omitted some details that probably only a grown up would catch.
  On the other hand, the "experiments" or recipies go from simple
  gelatin molds of bugs to more complicated creatures that
  progressively build upon previous experiments. They also
  encourage creativity by giving further suggestions for mixing
  colors, flavors. I was also pleasantly surprised at how well the
  "experiments" actually tasted for a toy kit. On the other hand,
  if made as directed we found it difficult to actually fill the
  monster molds with the amounts directed on the "recipie" cards.
  Overall, this was a great gift because it got my son and I to
  spend some fun time together</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">I found this hamper storage bin to be
  great the kids can see into the bins and the bins don't add
  weight to the unit so the kids can carry the bins easily to pick
  up toys. However the bins could be a little bigger because they
  tend to fall off the holding rods if you bump the unit. The
  hamper is great because my 3 year old son can fill up his hamper
  but he can't tip it over and spill dirty clothes on the floor but
  it is light weight and easy for him to help haul to the laundry
  if he wants to. Good Ite</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">I looked everywhere for a plastic
  durable toybox, seems so simple but unfortunately no one kept
  anything in stock to look at in person. I took a chance on this
  one because the price was right, and I'm very pleased. I like the
  pockets on the front, my son loves putting his books in &amp;amp;
  out. If I would change one thing it is the lid. It is lightweight
  as to not hurt little hands &amp;amp; fingers (which is good),
  but is never locked onto the toybox, it lifts off very easily, so
  sometimes just bumping it causes it to fall out of the shallow
  indentations it sits in. Other than that we love it</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">We got this toybox for our daughter
  when she turned one. We love that it doesn't have any sharp
  corners or hinges to get fingers stuck inside. It still looks
  like new 6 month later so it is very durable. If your child likes
  to get inside it like ours does there is no worry about them
  breaking it since the bottom is fabric. We also really like the
  pockets in front for storing smaller items- we always stick her
  favorite dolls and animals in there. We don't use the cover so
  that she can get the toys herself and it works perfect for us.
  Highly recommend!</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">I have been wanted a non-electronic
  non-paper Sudoku game for some time. Rubik's Sudoku is a self
  contained single player game board. I can move it from room to
  room without the playing pieces moving from where I have placed
  them on the board. There is one extra piece for each number/color
  tile included. With the color coding it is easy to learn the
  strategy behind Sudoku. I was not picking it up very fast when I
  tried the paper versions. After I progress through the 100
  puzzles included with this game I'll use the game board and
  pieces with the Sudoku magazine I have. For the cost I would
  recommend this over the more expensive wood versions. If cost is
  not an issue then you might go for one of the more durable all
  wood versions that Amazon has</Text>

  <Text category="toys_games">My daughter has been riding for about
  3 years now and she was so excited to see this Christmas morning.
  Of course that was one of the first things she wanted to play.
  Her grandma and I played and I was surprised at the amount of
  things I have learned just from taking her to her lessons! I'm
  sure there is a way to alter the game so there are more questions
  like Trivial Persuit but that was my only problem with the game.
  There isn't questions asked every move. But otherwise, it is an
  excellent game. I would definately recommend it</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">my five year old loves this . has the
  cutest songest and easiest lyrics to remember. So easy for a

  <Text category="toys_games">I bought my girls, ages 7 and 4, this
  product earlier this spring. It was easy to assemble, but finding
  the right height at which to hang it was a fairly time consuming
  process. It has been up for 4 months now and has seen daily use.
  When our play group meets here, the kids line up to have a turn,
  over and over again. I would recommend this for children who are
  reasonably coordinated and who have enough upper body strength to
  hold themselves up by their hands. A very durable product and a
  fun physical activity</Text>

  <Text category="toys_games">Our 2-year-old loves Thomas the
  Train, so this was a great gift for her. She has other Thomas
  items, but they're limited to playtime. This, however, is not
  only good for playtime, but safe enough for her to take to bed
  with her (she even kicked her Elmo out to make room for Thomas!).
  It's also small enough for her to be able to take on car rides. A
  great all around item to have if you've got a child that's really
  into Thomas</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">I was a bit afraid after reading the
  reviews, but this game is a hit with kids all ages. It takes
  about 3 minutes to set up, but it's not hard and the bees don't
  fall thru. We played more times than I can count this past week,
  and everyone enjoyed. I bought it for my 5 year old, but her
  cousins (ages 19, 17 and 13yo) joined in the fun and actually
  asked to play. My husband and I also got a kick out of it! Even
  our 3yo loved it, but she is incredibly lucky and would just pull
  randomly at leaves and none dropped, she's good! Our child didn't
  get bored while we were setting it back up, but everyone was
  sticking leaves and talking, so I guess it depends on your
  children's patience or attention span. In a few words: We all
  loved it</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">My nephew absolutely loved the games

  <Text category="toys_games">I chose this railway set over
  Learning Curve because I believe their prices are inflated, and I
  was not disappointed with it. The set is well made overall, with
  smooth, well-fitting track and sturdy accessories. My son (3) and
  daughter (6) have played with the set for hours every day since
  we got it, both with equal fascination. It fits perfectly with
  Thomas accessories we already own. I have only three small
  caveats: 1) Buy some "sure track" clips to use on elevated
  portions of the track. We use it on a smooth, level surface
  (hardwood floor), but the clips really enhance the stability for
  active play. 2) The round turntable did not spin freely when we
  got it, because the blue center piece was not perfectly round. We
  drilled out the rivet and removed the blue center piece, sanded
  down the edges, and replaced it. Now it's very easy for my kids
  to operate. 3) The trains included have slightly wobbly wheels,
  compared to Thomas trains. But they are functional, and my kids
  use the trains interchangeably. It's a great set, and a real
  bargain</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">I originally bought this for my
  husband, an EMT/FF. I wrote a poor review of company, based upon
  my entire experience w/ this storefront, and the other items I
  had purchased. I wasn't terribly pleased with the [...] pen but
  my husband took it to work and loved it. Said it went off several
  times from pocket while driving..and the entire ER loved it.
  Overall, it is fun and writes and does what it's supposed to:
  make you laugh</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">I appreciate the previous reviews,
  but we had already gotten the game by the time I read them. My
  family - ages 4, 6, 10 and three adults playing really enjoyed
  this game. We played until we had a winner (not too long)and then
  everyone remaining wanted to play to get a second place winner.
  Just our opinion - but we had a good time</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">I bought this car for my 4 1/2 year
  old son who absolutely LOVES the movie Cars. He also loves those
  Hot Wheels cars. I got him this car, and he really liked it. In
  fact, all of my kids (ages 4-15) like it! It's a really cute toy.
  It's even great if you are a Cars collector</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">My daughters (ages 5 and 2 1/2) were
  given these dolls for Christmas. They love them and play with
  them every day, especially the 5-year-old. I think the littlest
  one may be a little too young to really enjoy her fully, but she
  plays with her when her big sister plays with hers. I'm glad I
  didn't let some of the reviews discourage me from getting these.
  All the problems people are having with the limited English can
  be very easily remedied, if they read the directions fully. First
  of all, you must switch the doll from "display" mode, by moving
  the little switch on her back. The doll comes in the mode used so
  that people can try her out in the store. In this mode, she will
  only say one or two things in English. One you move the switch,
  you just have to "wake her up" and hold the button util she's
  speaking English. From that point on, she should speak English,
  even after waking up. However, if you turn her completely off via
  the back switch, you will have to switch her back to English by
  holding the bracelet down. I really have not had a problem, and
  certainly don't have to spend time interpreting what she's
  saying. That's why they make directions - it tells about the
  display mode right on the front</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">I bought this doll on ebay for my
  daughter for christmas because it wasnt available in stores. My
  daughter who just turned 6 yrs old loves this doll. Doll speaks
  both english and spanish. The only thing I dont like is that this
  baby keeps going to sleep after meals, but if your child wants to
  keep it awake you can press the bracelet or put the bottle in the
  mouth. Its a good thing if you dont want to run out of batteries
  soon or to give the doll some rest</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">This game is fun for the family. It's
  very simple and can be played by young children learning to
  count. It's not overly exciting by itself, but you can make it
  that way with your own spin on sound effects</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">This set is perfect for my daughter's
  new toy oven (miele) that she received for Christmas. The pots
  and pans are sized just right and the utensils are fit perfectly
  with the pots and pans. One of my utensils already broke apart,
  but that happens. I have a 3 year old girl who loves to cook, but
  she IS 3 and is not always careful. Not sure whether that utensil
  wasn't made well enough or it's a 3 year old's play, but the rest
  of the set seems fine. I would recommend this and the Miele
  oven</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">I was happy to order this early so
  they wouldn't run out, but I later saw the same set at a local
  store. There was only one left on the shelf, so I'm glad I
  ordered them anyway. They are my youngest son's favorite cars to
  start off with every morning</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">We got this when my kids turned 3,
  however could have gotten it when they turned 2. We play it every
  day. It tells you which player's turn it is, it also counts the
  number of spaces you are suppose to go with you and then it says
  "you're on the 'yellow' space" as a double check. There are 2
  modes and we can play on the "difficult" mode (the difference
  being with the easier mode you only have to know colors, with the
  more difficult mode, you have to know the alphabet). The
  characters are REALLY cute to. Best of all, EVERYONE is a winner
  - yeah! A concept that is difficult to teach a 2 or 3 year old,
  but this games does a superb job. The computer chip knows what
  space you are on so it makes sure that everyone wins within 2
  turns (that I've experienced), so those with little patience can
  "wait it out"</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">I bought the bean bag toss as a
  Christmas gift for my 22 month old son. He had played the Bean
  Bag Toss the first time at the Halloween carnival at the church.
  It was all he wanted to play that night. I wanted something that
  would be easy to pick up at the end of the day. At just three
  pieces,it is simple to put together and take apart. Although it
  says it is for 5 and older, it would probably get old fast for a
  child that age</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">This is a great game that is made
  very well. It is nice and solid wood construction with great
  bright colors. It will last us many years. I bought it for a
  small carnival style fundraising event that we needed games for
  children to play. It will surely be a hit! My daughter (8 years
  old) tried it out and really enjoyed playing with it. It has
  three bean bags of different weights making the game differing in
  difficulty. I would recommend this game to any one looking for
  entertainment for children. This game is best played on a table,
  so that a child can stand and throw the bean bags</Text>

  <Text category="toys_games">Muffet vs Spider! This is one cool
  looking figure and since the accessory spider is as big as Muffet
  makes it a kick butt scene. Again the turn is to the S&amp;amp;M
  pink &amp;amp; black leather bondage look, similar to the spiked
  outfit of Red Riding Hood. This is certainly not the image your
  mind conjures up to the nursery rhyme but it's a great display
  piece. The downfall from five stars is that when setup, Muffet is
  almost obscured by the spider. Both pieces look great in detail
  but a slightly different pose may have improved the
  figures</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">I hate spiders (yes I admitt that I
  make my wife kill them) and so does Miss Muffet...or is she. As
  her outfit might suggest, looks like Miss Muffet as a bit of a
  fetish going on, need I say S&amp;amp;M, and with that said,
  being pinned (blindly I might add) by this monsterous spider may
  be more of a turn on then you might think. You'd expect to see
  Miss Muffet in a frilly dress and bonnet maybe, blue dress to be
  exact but with her lether bondage in black and pink this
  'Twisted' point of view proves to be anything but expected. I say
  kudos to you McFarlane for truly reimagining the fairy tale
  (nursury rhyme, whatever) and giving us yet another piece of
  art</Text>

  <Text category="toys_games">My son is a huge fan of the Thomas
  &amp;amp; Friends diecast trains and building sets. Despite the
  fact he had amassed a large portion of these toys, an important
  character was missing from his collection: Terrence the Tractor.
  Of course, he was thrilled when this little vehicle showed up in
  his Easter basket. No, Terrence is not a train, but one of the
  tractors that plows the fields on the Island of Sodor. Terrence
  is a wonderful character, with his bright orange coat of paint
  and happy face. He has one magnet on his back end, perfect for
  pulling trains (or having trains pull him). In all honesty, we
  have not had any problems with Terrence's treads coming off--they
  are designed to wrap tightly around the wheels when rolling, so
  no matter how hard my three-year-old tugs on them, they stay put.
  Terrence is also a very durable toy--my son has dropped him,
  stepped on him, ran him into the other trains, and Terrence shows
  no signs of wear, tear, split wood, or chipped paint. Finally,
  Terrence is small enough to fit easily in my son's hands during
  play, but can also be slipped into a coat pocket during a car
  trip. All in all, Terrence is a terrific vehicle, and a perfect
  addition to a child's Thomas &amp;amp; Friends collection</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">This large version of Michael Myers
  is a lot beter than the McFarlane version released ever how many
  years ago. First the pose is better.Second NO BLOOD STAINS! Don't
  get me wrong, Michael Myers is a movie killer, but he never got
  bloody! That was my biggest complaint with the McFarlane version.
  He does have slight oily looking stains on his coveralls, but if
  you remember from the movie, he killed a mechanic to get those
  coveralls. Finally third, and pretty cool, the sound effect is
  diffrent. Instead of Laurie Strode's whiny help me , you get the
  Halloween theme playing along with Michael's breathing. Remeber
  the end of the first movie, after Loomis shot him, but the body
  was missing, the closing shots were shown with the theme music
  accompanied by Myers' breathing. If you got the NECA boxed set of
  Michael Myers and Loomis and liked it, get this! If you got the
  Mcfarlane version, get this! If you just like Halloween, get
  this! You won't be disappointed! Looks better in person than on
  the picture</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">The fun surprises with all of the
  magical castle playsets were a hit with my child. She had a great
  time using her "magic wands" to see what would happen. With the
  bathroom playset, having the vanity doors pop open and a step
  stool (I assume so Dora could step up to the sink &amp;amp; brush
  her teeth) pops out was a very fun surprise. My 7 year old has
  already spent MANY hours making up princess stories with the
  castle. The whole set was a great buy</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">We have several boxes of these
  Melissa And Doug bead sets b/c we just can't get enough of them!
  My three children (twin boys - one girl) love to sit and make
  necklaces over and over again! YES! My boys love this too!!! It's
  a great exercise for their fine motor skills! The patience they
  have all developed to sit and string these small beads together
  is wonderful! It's great practice for them as they create
  different patterns with each new necklace. I suggest getting a
  few boxes - especially if you have more than one child playing
  with them at the same time. Our favorite set includes letters so
  they can each spell out their own name or other words. **Not
  suggested for small children who will mistake them for pieces of
  candy.</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">We bought this toy for our 1 year old
  son. It is very sturdy and well made and the blocks inside are
  great. I agree with the other reviews that the wagon moves to
  fast on wood floors and it does not turn well. My biggest
  compaint, however, is that when both lids are closed, the wagon
  looks just like a 2-step ladder. Our son constantly tries to
  climb it, like stairs. The other day, he finally stood up on top
  of the wagon and the wagon tipped straight over onto the handle.
  My son fell over with it and crashed on his face. There are two
  rubber stoppers on the back of the wagon, but they DO NOT prevent
  it from falling over. My son is fine, but this toy is very
  dangerous and I do not recommend it!</Text>

  <Text category="toys_games">I purchased this from Amazon, having
  only seen it in photographs. Based on the online images I
  expected the top to be opaque pink, and the bottom part to be
  see-thru pink, so I could see what was inside. When it arrived
  the top was indeed the exact color as on Amazon, but the bottom
  was a pearlized lighter opaque pink. I don't have any problem
  with this, in fact I may even like it better, but it was just
  unexpected. Overall the case is great. Just as advertised it will
  hold 15 dolls in a standing position, with plenty of space in the
  2 compartments in the lid for all sorts of shoes and accessories.
  The doors on top are difficult to open, and I know I will have to
  help my 4 year old with it at first, until they "soften" up a
  bit, but at least they won't be flying open, spewing mini plastic
  platform shoes everywhere. As one previous reviewer noted, there
  is a larger open space in the main compartment that isn't great
  for holding a lot. I plan on using either a Ziploc bag in that
  space to maximize it, or attaching a (pink!?!) piece of cardboard
  or thin plastic to extend the height of it. We'll then be able to
  fit massive amounts of clothes in there! My cart does say
  "Barbie" on the lid, but the markings are discrete, and
  tastefully done. Overall, I like this cart. It's probably the
  best storage device for Barbie that I've seen. It's cute, fairly
  well-made and will hold a ton. I didn't give it 5 stars because
  of the issue with the interior storage, the handle seems a bit
  flimsy, the wheels are not great for carpet, and it's a bit
  pricey</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">I give this Leap Pad book 3 stars for
  fun because my children were not interested enough to even look
  at all the pages.They played with it a lot, but did not get even
  half way through, maybe that just means it is full of fun stuff
  to do, but since my kids have not gone back to it, I feel it does
  not hold their interest quite enough. Educational, 4 stars
  because some of it seemed a bit simple, like the space page. 5
  stars for durability because it is no more and no less durable
  then regular Leap Pad books. Dont like the eraseable pen though.
  Must cover it each and every time, even between questions. If
  it's off more then 5 seconds, it dries out.I peronally did not
  find it very easy to keep picking up and putting down pens. I
  tried using a pen in each hand, and it dried out, so I had to
  keep putting down the regular "pen" to cover up the eraseable
  pen. Pretty annoying</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">We love this game. All members of the
  family can play it and we've enjoyed it as a family many
  time</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">Easy, straightforward interface (for
  instance, a button for each number) and navigation through cells.
  Easy to tell which numbers start with the puzzle and which ones
  you entered. Provides time-penalized hints in any cell. Pauseable
  and saves your game between (auto-off) power sessions. Most
  importantly, this device lets you make "pencil marks"! I have
  checked out at least a dozen products and I have yet to come
  across an electronic Sudoku that electronically lets me enter
  dots or Xs to indicate which numbers might (not) be in a cell. It
  makes me wonder if the people ordered to design and implement
  these games actually play Sudoku themselves. The closest I've
  seen let you enter multiple numbers in a cell and it blinks
  through them, which I find cumbersome and patience-trying. Sadly,
  this thing doesn't do electronic marks either, but their
  lower-cost solution involves a dry-erase pen that lets you make
  the marks right on the screen, on top of little numbers printed
  in each cell's background. Losing marks in travel is prevented by
  the recessed contours of the screen. Why not 5 stars? Just the
  fact that the marks aren't electronic, there's no backlight, and
  the shadows cast by the dry-erase marks can be a little
  disorienting. Otherwise, a well-done, fun, and addictive
  product</Text>

  <Text category="toys_games">I've been an Amazon customer for
  years, but this is the first time a product stood out enough for
  me to write a review. I bought this for my 8 yr. old daughter and
  I figured my 6 yr. old son could use it later. I was very
  hesitant, because there aren't a lot of reviews and it's
  expensive. Well, we've had it a few days and my daughter has been
  playing more with "Secrets of the Master Magician: An
  Apprentice's Manual", which I also bought at the same time
  (another great gift). My daughter is interested in this and it's
  easy for her to put things together. My son is obsessed with it!
  It's similar (for him) to the Lego creatures he puts together. He
  needs a little help from time to time, but he can certainly
  follow the very well laid out diagrams. So far they've created an
  FM radio, a scifi noise maker, a sound detecting space noise
  maker thingy, a propeller that spins and flies into the air, a
  seven segment display, a volt meter connected to the solar cell.
  After connecting the solar cell, I realized my son thought the
  solar cell would come on like a computer screen or TV! After
  explaining it and putting my hand over it; now they both know
  what a solar cell does. - There are 5 books of experiments. -
  Each project has a nice simple color picture of how to connect
  all the components. - All components are clearly marked. - The
  diagrams are a top view. Since the connections are layered on top
  of one another 2 and 3 deep, it takes a little figuring as to
  what's on top and what's on bottom. It's easy for an adult. It's
  part of the "puzzle" for the kids. After we put a few together,
  they both got it. - The pieces seem sturdy enough and snap
  together easily - There is great assortment of parts to create
  lots and lots of very interesting projects. - My kids love the
  projects. I've been very impressed. - It has a cable that you can
  connect to the microphone port of a PC sound card. I haven't
  played with this. There is software, it looks like you can turn
  your PC into an oscilloscope. Looks interesting. There's a whole
  book for these projects. I just saw the cover, so it's likely
  that there's even more to it. My kids are learning a lot with
  this. While they are putting things together, I can explain how
  these different parts work. There are lots of opportunities to
  take the project and modify it by replacing parts, change a light
  out for the speaker, etc. For example, my son put the 7 segment
  LED together. I wasn't impressed. I was hoping to put together a
  counter, but it just connects each segment to ground to turn all
  the segments on. There are 750 projects, so maybe there is a
  counter project. Regardless, my son was fascinated. He changed
  all the connections manually to count from 0 to 9. He changed the
  main power resistor to see it go brighter with a smaller resistor
  and dimmer with a bigger resistor. Lots of implicit learning
  going on. I pointed to the microwave display and said, "See,
  that's how it works!</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">I enjoy seeing my twin four year old
  son's play with the Read with Me DVD program and CD's. The
  children are learning as they play. I see them recalling
  information and reviewing parts of the story. This educational
  toy is very engaging. The only problem I have with this toy is
  sometimes if the child is not on level with the DVD player it
  takes several tries to get the DVD player to respond to the
  remote.</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">If you're not sure if your little one
  will really be "into" these train sets, this one is a great one
  to try out. It's more fun when you get all the extra buildings,
  but if it's an iffy situation, then I highly recommend this set.
  We bought this set for our little one because he just wasn't too
  sure about these trains. However, after he received it, he found
  out that he liked them and well, now we have a bunch of them! The
  $40 is not much to invest n a toy that they're not going to play
  with either! I just wish this set had more things with it besides
  just the track and the train. However, you can get a little
  better deal if you buy the track separately from Maxim, who makes
  Brio trains now, and the train separately as well. This train
  will chew up the batteries pretty quickly unless you use
  Duracell. Energizer only makes it two days in this train but
  Duracell makes it two-and-a-half weeks. Other than that, highly
  recommend this toy</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">My 3 year old son plays with them all
  the time. They are a little challenging and he loves to see the
  completed puzzle. The box is great and keeps the puzzles
  separate. Each puzzle peice is marked on the back for easy
  sorting. I am ordering all of the boxed sets ASAP</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">It is a magnificient item! So simple
  and beautiful yet full of really small details and "hello, here
  is Johnny Cash!" Looks really great on foot with his guitar. Just
  like real. I strongly recommend it to all Cash fans</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">I bought this because as a kid my
  grandparents had one that I would play with constantly everytime
  I visited, and at the age of 7 was certain I could solve it. I
  never did, and eventually it broke, and it wasn't until I was
  sitting at my work waiting for my computer to do something, that
  I thought I needed something to do while I waited for my computer
  to unfreeze, or for the network to come back online. So I bought
  a rubiks cube, figured that it was a good portable puzzle thats
  easy to store, and is only one piece. It came with a display
  stand, so I keep it displayed next to my monitor, and have
  co-workers come by and scramble it hoping that I won't be able to
  put it back, but I always have. Like I said its a puzzle, but not
  with alot of pieces, and its portable, so if your taking the bus
  home, you can kill time with it, then put it back in your
  briefcase, or backpack. I love it and haven't gotten sick of it
  yet</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">One day I realized that my baby is
  now a toddler and his toys are all...well baby toys! I browsed
  the toy aisles for the perfect, age apporpriate replacements
  hating to spend more money on more plastic, yet desperate for
  anything that will engage him for at least 15 minutes and keep
  him STILL so I can put clothes away, vacuum, sometimes just SIT
  and play. This does it! Reliable duplo/lego quality. Non
  frustrating because the pieces actually stay together. Easy
  assembly. Of course my little guy is 22 months so I still have to
  do the majority of the assembly. I did get this for him at age 19
  months and by now he has caught on as to how to put the track
  together. He tries to put the cars together but still needs my
  help to lock the pieces in place. I am constantly amazed at how
  much toddlers pick up by watching grownups, so keep putting this
  back together while your little one is present. Luca does love to
  disassemble the track and it is a challange keeping it together
  however, over the last month, persistence has paid off and he has
  figured out how to re-assenmble his little messes. The assembly
  is easy enough for him to get it on his own! These chunky toys
  accomomodate busy little toddler hands perfectly. This particular
  set comes with everything necessary for your toddler to "get to
  work". This set has just enough to busy your toddler without
  being overwhelming! This set has satisfied my little guy
  (although I did buy him the Toby (he is just so cute) set too. My
  older boys take Tae Kwan Do every night and this set is a staple
  in the karate bag. It definately keeps the younger .0brothers and
  sisters busy and off the MATS. Other add-ons are available but
  right now, this set, and the Toby have been just enough! The
  price sems high for the seemingly few pieces. I am the first to
  admit it is difficult to commit to a 25$ purchase, but as with
  Lego/Duplo products, the quality and play/learning value add
  greatly to the plastic parts making it an excellent purchase!
  GREAT GRANDPARENT GIFT! Even a perfect toy to keep at
  Grandparents house!</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">Our daughter got the pull and spin
  caterpillar for christmas (she was 9months at the time). At the
  time she wasn't able to pull it but loved to chase the
  caterpillar as it was being pulled. Now at 12 months she is able
  to pull it herself and loves putting just about anything on the
  back of the caterpillar. The toy it self has a very cute face and
  when pulled the eyes and ears move up and down. The only problem
  with the caterpillar is the pull string. It is very small and
  thin allowing it to slip through little hands while trying to
  pull it. Overall a wonderful toy, not only for the balls that
  come with it but for anything else that your little puts on
  it</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">This is a fun version of Battleship.
  And the nice part is being able to play against the game</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">I bought this set for my three
  children 5,4,2 last Christmas at a fancy toy store. This product
  is top of the line and my kids can not get enough of this. The
  marble runs are easy to build, sturdy and so much for them to
  play with. There are a variety to build with the more advanced
  sets also we bought a few more "fun" and cool looking marbles as
  they raced them down. The kids can change out the different
  blocks to make the marbles react in different ways- which is a
  creative aspect. I LOVE THIS TOY!!!! My kids beg me to make them
  a new marble run all the time. You do need a hard surface to
  build on, since we didn't have a "train table" we put it on a
  hard piece of cardboard so it laid flat on the carpet, that way
  you don't have to hear the clink-clink of the marbles as they hit
  the bottom..</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">My daughter rec'd this game as a gift
  for her fourth birthday. It was wonderful because my son, who was
  two could play it too (with my assistance of course). Now they
  are 5 and 7 and still play it. It is a simple game that requires
  no reading skills and reinforces counting. I would recommend it
  to everyone</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">Everyone in my family is enamored
  with this fantastic Darth Vader mask. We bought it initially for
  my son, who is Darth Vader obsessed, but it's quickly become the
  house favorite. (Even Grandpa can't resist putting this mask on
  and pretending to be Darth for a spell.) On another note: we keep
  this helmet on our bookshelf in the living room and it makes a
  great conversation piece. It is so realistic looking and it makes
  a menacing piece of art on display</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">I got these for my 28 month old
  daughter for Valentines Day as she is fascinated by skating. They
  are a pain to put on, but she doesn't mind. They have "beginner"
  settings, which she used for the first hour and then it was on to
  the "expert" setting! What I like is all the safety gear come
  with them, so she knows that she has to wear it "all or nothing".
  These are great and seem to be safe and sturdy...with
  supervision, of course</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">The kit was great I thought it was
  soo much fun to paint the puppies different colors! This toy is
  really cool because you can hang your puppies,put magginets on
  them or just play with them! This toy is pretty durable but if
  you slammed it really hard on a hard floor it would probally
  break.If you like craft kits you should deffinatly get this
  one</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">I love this kit--the puppies are so
  cute and the project is really fun. I loved the finished craft
  and it gave my children the freedom to creat whatever they
  wanted. Would like to buy more of these to make a whole kennel
  and to give as birthday and holiday gifts. All we needed was in
  the box and the directions were so easy to follow</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">All year long, my three and a half
  year old daughter asked for a digital camera for Christmas.
  3-weeks before Christmas, she sat on Santa's lap at the mall and
  asked for a TRUMPET of all things. I immediately came home and
  searched online. Everyone had the colorful play trumpets that
  were electronic with diferent characters on them, but none of
  them looked real! And I'm pretty sure that my daughter was
  expecting Santa to bring a real trumpet, so I found this, ordered
  it and it was here BEFORE the estimated delivery date! It is
  extremely lightweight (cannot be used as a weapon), each button
  has a different tone to it AND it looks real (besides the fact
  that it's not brass). She loved it! She plays it all the time and
  unbelievably, it's not the most annoying toy she has. I would
  recommend it to anyone with young children interested in musical
  instruments</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">My 6 yr old loves this game of War.
  The food chain comes to life in this game of who eats who.
  Besides the plankton, shrimp, little fish, big fish and Shark,
  there are also electric eel cards and ink out octopus cards for
  added excitement. The game is played like war, but the
  instructions add a slap Jack element. This is not my favorite
  part. We have limited the slap jack part to just the electric eel
  card, which still annoys me and makes it difficult for a younger
  child to play with older children. The ink out card prevents
  anyone from winning that set of cards and gives the person with
  less shark cards a chance to win shark cards from the other
  person. This game can go on and on, don't be afraid to adjust
  some rules to make this game more enjoyable for your little one
  and not so complicated. The cards are made well.</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">My children (4 &amp;amp; 6)love this
  game. It is great because no reading is necessary. The game asks
  the questions and even repeats them when necessary. While my kids
  don't know all the topics covered they enjoy the game. The fact
  that the game makes sure they move the correct number of spaces
  is great too. I definitely recommend this game and I will
  probably buy the next level of it.</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">She's crazy about horses and loves

  <Text category="toys_games">I got one for my

  us will love it more. ADORABLE!!</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">truly wonderful! My 4 year old son
  hasn't quit playing this game since Christmas</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">I bought this for my son for
  Christmas after he saw it advertised in a magazine. He has been
  playing with it almost non-stop since then. It is loud and
  somewhat intricate but easily masterable by small kids. It also
  connects with other Matchbox sets and comes with a mat for
  layout. Based on my boy's interest and use so far, this rates 5
  out of 5</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">My three kids have loved this tunnel
  since they were two(they are now 5,7 &amp;amp; 9) They still play
  with it alot. They do a variety of things with it including magic
  tricks where the child inside will "magically" disappear. It's
  great exercise too to be on your hands and knees. They also love
  to play "tornado" with it, where one child gets inside standing
  up while the others throw stuffed animals into it, meanwhile the
  child inside throws them back outlike a real tornado does</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">This is a great toy for kids of any
  age. We bought it last year when my daughter was 2 1/2. She still
  plays with it. It folds up very nicely and no matter how many
  times her and my 6 year old son jump on the outside, it still
  looks like new. At my son's 6th birthday party (13 boys, 2
  girls), the kids stood with it upright and pretended they were an
  alien worm, while the other kids beat them with blow up swords.
  Yes I was supervising, but the tunnel took the beating and is
  still in great shape. Even out cats crawl through it. There are
  not many toys that are this much fun and durable</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">What more can you say? It's durable,
  it's fun, it folds so nicely and be put away! GOOD BUY</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">I was skeptical about this one.. as I
  have learned that the cheaper the toy is.. the less my baby likes
  it. Though he absolutely adores this floor mat. I got it for him
  when he was 2 months old. He is only 4 months old now but can't
  get enough of it. The little octopus does make sound when it
  spins.. but he can't reach it yet. Though its hilarious to watch
  him try! He gets so frustrated and beats up the other toys, but
  then smiles in the end when I go spin it for him. I give this 5
  stars because the floormat itself is. I would give it 4 stars but
  that is based on my baby and all babies are different. The only
  problems we have with it, which would make it 4 stars would be
  the fact that aside from the octopus there are no other sounds,
  and there are no lights. My baby loves sounds and lights. So if
  you have one of those, expect yours not to want to play as long
  on the mat in the beginning stages. Ours plays for about 20-30
  minutes, then he wants to be moved to his swing so he can look in
  the mirror and hear the music. But you can get really good tummy
  time on this and it keeps them entertained and laying out
  straight (instead of scrunched up in a swing so often) so you can
  get a few things done around the house. Oh and we have noticed
  that our baby will play on it longer, if we go over and play with
  him every once in awhile. Helping him reach the toys, making the
  octopus spin, etc. Then we get another 20 minutes to do whatever.
  So all in all... its a great product... Just be warned that the
  little mirror on one of the fish.. isn't a mirror. Its one of
  those flashy material looking things and the baby can't see his
  reflection in it.. cause I cant even see mine in it. If the toys
  are hanging to low for your baby, you can flip them over the top
  bar once and they will hang higher, or move the baby on the mat a
  bit.</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">I work at a daycare and have an 11 mo
  old and can promise this is a great toy! My baby loves it and she
  usually gets bored with toys fast. All of the babies like to open
  and close the door and crawl through. It also has a doorbell that
  rings and a light that turns on. It plays several different songs
  and really keeps the attention of older children as well as
  babies. I highly recommend</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">My children enjoy this playouse. In
  the summer I had it in the backyard. In the winter, it lives in
  the basement. I bough acrylic paints to color the interior. This
  will be their surprise when I put it outside in the summer. It
  will look like a new playhouse. Buy this and enjoy playing with
  your children</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">We just set up our playhouse and I'm
  very happy with it! It's large enough for a parent to sit inside,
  it was easy to set up and my 2.5 year old son is loving his new
  playhouse! He really likes the basketball hoop/game side of the
  unit. I wish there were more electronic noises and interactive
  components on the walls of the playhouse, but I still think it's
  a great value for the money</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">Based on the other reviews, this
  grandmother decided to buy this particular playhouse for my
  grandson's first birthday present! I am not the least bit
  disappointed. Colorful, action packed activities everywhere,
  sturdy, easy to assemble, cold weather friendly and perfect for
  the little boys in your life! There are a lot of girlie
  playhouses, but this one is the answer for boys. My son put it
  together in about an hour, and was ready for the birthday party
  guests. Happy Grandmother</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">This update of the old Big Wheel
  style "Green Machine" is made to handle the height, weight and
  wear and tear of big boys (and girls, up to the latter 30s have
  even been caught on it), yet the seat is easily adjusted so that
  the average 5-year-old can reach its pedals. The main cool
  feature is the dual lever steering. Just like with the original
  hollow model plastic version, pulling on the steering levers in
  opposite directions sends the machine into a wicked spin-out that
  kids just can't get enough of. Yet under the usage of some pretty
  crazy 6, 9 and 12 year olds on a steep downhill driveway, the
  machine has almost always remained three wheels on the ground. So
  first, I am amazed at the staying play value of this toy. For two
  years now, it has been the first toy out of the garage every time
  the door opens. And second, I am amazed at its durability. The 9
  year old who uses it reguarly is an Evel Kneivel who is notorious
  for breaking my children's toys left and right, and so far, it
  has held up without a squeak. This was a million times better
  value for our hundred spot, than the darn motorized motorcycle we
  bought a couple years prior for twice that amount which only
  lasted a year before the gears stripped. Definitely consider this
  for your 5-10 year old boy, even if he already has a two-wheeler.
  It's a whole different kind of fun. ***** all the way</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">My 21 month old daughter received
  Baby Pooh for Christmas and plays with him EVERY day. She loves
  diapering pooh when her baby brother gets a diaper change, and
  bathes with him nightly. He comes with a duckie and bottle of his
  own. The high chair back does not stay attached to the chair, but
  Pooh still sits upright and has enjoyed many meals with my
  daughter. Pooh is made from hard plastic and, sadly, his arm
  broke off when dropped by my husband this weekend. My daugher is
  handling the trauma OK, but we are getting her an new Pooh for
  her birthday because she loves him so much. I recommend it</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">This train table is a nice size,
  bigger than I expected. It went together easily and is sturdy
  enough for my grandson's Thomas stuff. It seems to be made as
  well as what I saw at Toys R Us for double the price.</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">I bought this for our grandson age 13
  soon to be 14 and he was very pleased with it. He did say that it
  was a little more difficult to put together but he did it and was
  very pleased with himself and with the results. Thank you for
  making this possible. The price was right</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">My son received the smartville ice
  cream shop for his first bday. he played with it all the time. We
  bought him the rest of the set for christmas. This is definitely
  his favorite toy. He is 15 months now and he plays with this set
  almost all day long. This is one of the best things I could have
  bought for him. He understands how it works by placing the
  characters on the round spots. I feel it will be a great teaching
  tool for when he is ready to learn the alphabet and his
  numbers</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">this is a great item. Theres alot
  going on in such a tiny little space. The detail is great,from
  the kraken that can make a boat disappear,to the bone
  cage.There's a collapsing bridge,a collapsing building,a trap
  door,runaway mill,and a cool magnetic boat race and more.It comes
  with Jack,Will,Norrington,and the cannibal chief,but no Davy.That
  was a little disappointing.But anyway its a fun item for all
  ages.</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">I bought this high chair for my
  daughter's second birthday because I love the look of it. The
  similar chair made by Badger Basket Toys gets terrible reviews
  for being poorly constructed so I went with this one despite it
  having no reviews. I couldn't be happier. This high chair is
  solidly built and was easy to assemble. I love the white finish
  because it will be relatively neutral as my daughter's room may
  go through decorative changes in the coming years. I don't forsee
  her outgrowing this toy for quite a few years and it is sturdy
  enough to last. She has several dolls, the largest being her 17"
  Corolle Lila, who fits beautifully in the chair. I would guess
  that this chair could possibly handle up to a 20" doll. While it
  is solidly built, I am obviously discouraging my daughter from
  sitting in the chair herself (I've caught her trying to several
  times) because no doll chair should be expected to be that
  sturdy! The only real negative is the joke of a chair pad. I
  actually just tossed it because it doesn't really add to the
  toy's play value anyway and would probably just be a nuisance. I
  highly recommend this high chair for the child in your life who
  enjoys taking care of babies. It's made me look to KidKraft for
  more toys and doll furniture</Text>

  it, and chew on it with his gums</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">I purchased this at my 10 year olds
  request for a birthday present. I was skeptical, but since it was
  the only thing requested, I bought it. We've had it 4 weeks. What
  a great pool toy! Kids love it! We have a 22 foot above ground
  pool, and it works fine. I have bought floats for upwards of $25
  dollars, so for the cost of the Wave Cruiser you can't go wrong.
  It seems to be well built and sturdy. I wouldn't hesitate to get
  on it. Takes 8 "D" batteries that are in a water tight case. It
  will tip over as will any pool float when the rider gets rowdy,
  but that seems to be part of the fun for the kids. Overall great
  gift idea</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">I bought this for my niece's 5th
  Birthday, and she loved it! My nephew (8) wouldn't leave her
  alone, he wanted to ride it. My brother-in-law got on it, and it
  actually moved him around. It is very durable, thick plastic
  looks like it will last a while. For the price, if it lasts this
  summer only, it is worth it</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">It was impossible to find baby
  sunglasses in the winter until I found these stunning red infant
  shades. A plus was there is a soft strap to keep the sunglasses
  on. Our granddaughter looks like a movie star</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">My daughter recv'd this from her
  grandmother for her third b/d and i think its alot cuter than in
  the picture. It has worked fine for my daughter she has figured
  out how to work it by herself and even has shown mommy how to
  turn it on once in awhile. she likes playing the cds with her
  name in them that her grandpa got her for her b/d. The only thing
  i did wrong was let my daughter keep it in her room w/o me
  checking up on her, she went and poured some kind of liquid in
  the storage compartments so i had to take it away as punishment.
  I have forgotten about it until i seen this ad which now i think
  i will get it back out and let her play with it again. I have
  even played my cds on this while cleaning the kitchen and they
  sounded fine. My daughter has alot of the princess furniture in
  her room and this really matched and is very cute, and we have
  had no problems with this item so far. (knock on wood).</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">I bought this CD player for my
  daughter's 5th birthday not expecting it to last a month. To my
  surprise it's worked wonderfully. She figured out how to operate
  it pretty easily and she listens to it every night before bed.
  We've had it for 6 months now with no problems. My favorite
  feature is the compartment for the CD's. It keeps them from being
  left lying around and getting scratched.</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">DOND is a fun game, and we've had
  some lively sessions playing it. There is an additional (we
  forget...we got rid of it!)...complicated thing that the game
  had, and made it "less fun" to play. You also have to disregard
  the 'suggestion' regarding "how" to give an Banker's Offer...it
  doesn't work, so you have to use your own judgement, to "jiggle
  it"...actually, this makes it even More fun! All-in-all...from 6
  to 60, of we whom have played (if you follow the 'disregard'
  suggestions)...it's a 4-star fun.</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">As always a pleaser! My girls, ages
  9, 8 and 2 have about 8 other sweet streets. They play for hours
  with them. I also bought her the Shopping District and Movie
  Theater. They got a big kick out of the music the movie theater
  played. I would highly recommend Sweet Streets Village gift set
  and all the other sweet street products!!!!</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">My 2.5 yr old son loves this puzzle.
  I help him put it together and he just loves the challenge and
  the construction equipment. I like how tough the pieces are- they
  have held up even when stepped on and chewed on by a baby. Very
  nice</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">Very cute product and well worth the
  money. My three year old loves all the things he can do with it
  in the bath tub</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">This is a simple pirate ship tub toy
  with two backyardigans characters. My pirate enthusiasts (ages 6,
  4 and 2) love it. It doesn't move or make noise, but it floats
  well and is sturdy. The best part is that the characters fit in
  the bottom of the ship for easy storage</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">This was strickly a replacement for
  an old solver that I have had. Would not want to be without one
  as I am an avid crossword puzzle solver. Many thanks for the
  prompt service I was given by Amazon</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">The developers of this game did a
  great job coming up with questions designed to appeal to kids,
  questions like: If you could star in a movie, which movie would
  you choose? If you could eat only one food for the rest of your
  life what would it be? The questions range from simple to a bit
  more complex, so that kids who like challenges as well as those
  who don't will enjoy the game. Another thing: Although you can
  follow the rules and play this strictly as a board game, we used
  it while we were just sitting around the table having a casual
  chat. Sometimes the kids asked the question, sometimes the adults
  did...but we all learned more about one another...a LOT
  more...and many of the questions got us talking about family
  history, memories, etc. Lots of fun! It'd be great to take the
  questions along on a trip or while eating at a restaurant since
  they are surefire conversation starters but not so personal that
  anyone's "personal boundaries" will be invaded. Plus, there are
  no right or wrong answers and any information provided is
  strictly voluntary, revealing as much or as little as the
  respondent wants. One caveat: You will eventually go through all
  the questions so this game won't last forever...unless you are
  able to find new people to participate. If so, it be used for
  years. In terms of fostering family closeness without any
  threatening or off-limits questions (in short, everyone has to
  play nicely together) this is great!</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">It says some silly things which might
  not make us laugh. but overall a cute toy and kids will like
  i</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">I got this as a gift for my neece,
  she loves it, her parents love it too. She is now three years
  old, She got it last yr. for Christmas,...I was over to see her
  yesterday, and it still is like new. The velcro is very strong..
  and it's a very safe toy.. Her baby brother, now is playing with
  it too, he is one yr. I recommend to all! Great buy.</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">my 3 yo loves this - got it with a
  beautiful kitchen and she goes to town. It's east to use and she
  retends to make sandwichs and cut the fruit and veggies - very
  cute</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">I bought this for my daughter for
  Christmas, three days before her first birthday. She loves taking
  the pieces out, banging them together and recently, putting them
  in the correct spaces! The size of the pieces is perfect for a
  young toddler and the knobs are the right size for her hands.
  Will definately look at Melissa and Doug puzzles for her
  again</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">Imaginext Dinosaurs' T-Rex is quite
  simply fun to play with. The dinosaur not only is a great toy,
  with a lever underneath that reacts with the dino biting and
  yelping out a loud roar. It comes with a catapult with its
  respective stones (2) that the caveman (also included, with
  accessories) can operate, to save himself from the deadly bite of
  the dino. My 3-year old picked it up since he got it, and he
  hasn't let go</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">My little boy is a certified
  dino-phile, to the point where he's had to teach me to pronounce
  several dinosaur names (ever tried saying Edmontonsaurus three
  times fast?). But, like any kid, his favorite remains the T-Rex,
  tyrant lizard king. When it comes to his numerous dinosaur toys,
  this is the most durable by far. Although we've had the same
  problems getting this to stand at times, as mentioned by another
  reviewer, that hasn't diminished my son's enjoyment. To top it
  off, he's come up with fun new uses for the toy, too. That
  catapult is VERY good at aiming at our family cat, much to my
  son's delight</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">this toy looks great it has the house
  which kids love and the climbing par</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">My son has played with these from 6
  months old, and still likes them occasionally (18 months now).
  The small car is nice for babies to shake. They don't do much,
  but they are cute</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">This is a fun toy, just a bit
  difficult to stack because of the narrow wheels. You can ask
  which one is biggest, what color is this car, ask about the
  numbers on the cars, etc... that is why I think it is educational
  to that respect. My son still has this, and is three years old
  and will play with it every once in awhile with his matchbox cars
  stacking them or just rolling them along</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">I got this for my 2 year old for
  Christmas. It was a nice present, he enjoys it. 2 things though,
  it only came with 75 smaller balls so i had to purchase another
  100 from somewhere else and the picture is misleading as to how
  big the item actually is. It could fit 2 toddlers in the pit
  itself and that would be max, and that is two 2-3 year olds. It
  is comparable though to other ball pits in size and he seems to
  enjoy the hoop and putting the ball through the hole in Big
  Bird's ice cream cone so i feel it was worth the money,
  especially since i didn't pay for shipping</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">I got this for the price, $4.99. I
  put it together 2 days ago and my 4 year old daughter has spent
  almost every waking hour playing with it. The first thing she
  asks me in the morning: "Will you play Mermadia with me mommy?
  Pretty Please?" The parts come off easily but do not fall off. My
  daughter is a little rough on her toys but since the pieces of
  this are easily taken apart and put back together it is great for
  her. She loves it.</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">My 4 year old child loves this car!
  He spend a lot of time playing with it, and it's incredible all
  the functions and programing it has, and what he loves more it's
  his talking realistic mouth! Totaly recomendable</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">I received the order in record time
  and in excellet condition. Saved time from trying to find it in a
  store loacally, and arrived right at my door step. Really cool
  item, my son loves it</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">Every family, every party, every
  gathering of kids and adults or combinations of both will love
  this game</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">My [...] really likes this train
  puzzle. He knows his alphabet and is able to pick out which
  puzzle piece comes next in line and attach it. It goes straight
  across and is over 10 feet long. There is also a picture with
  each letter on the piece and this has helped him with words
  beginning with that letter. He will say "Q quail" or "N nut" when
  he is putting the piece on. The pieces are easy to attach, thick
  and very sturdy. The pieces comes apart with no worry of ripping
  the picture off. This would make a really nice gift for a 2-4
  year old. The box is also very nice to keep the puzzle in.</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">My 3 year old son LOVES this puzzle
  and has played with it for over a year. He likes to put it
  together over and over again, making a "train" across the floor.
  It has really helped him to learn his alphabet, and I highly
  recommend it!</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">Deductive reasoning at its best.
  Awesome and absolutely brilliant. I got this for my 8 year old
  daughter and my hisband and I have taken turns to play with her,
  and we have been late for dinner many times--- not anting to get
  up till we finish the game. I recommend it highly for parents who
  want to spend some quality time with their kids</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">Yasmin, one of the super-stylin'
  Bratz Rock Angelz, is in my possession! So, I'm sorry my reviews
  go in to EVERY LITTLE DETAIL(as one customer complained), but
  that's how I do it! So if you haven't bought a ticket to
  info-town, either get the heck outta here, or buy one by reading
  this review. HERE GOES! First off, Yasmin has blonde streaks
  flowing through her dark chestnut hair. Just like the other Rock
  Angelz(Cloe, Jade, Sasha), Yasmin's hair is awesome
  quality;smooth, great duraility, etc. That feature makes her
  great for younger kids because her hair can get messed up many
  times, then smoothen out. Yasmin has the liveliest color eyes of
  the Rock Angelz; emerald green. This works as both a strikingly
  gorgeous feature and hot highlight to the doll. Her lip color,
  pink, really stands out on the doll. And of course, as most other
  Yasmin's do, she has the warm cocoa skin color. She has dark
  blush and sparkles above her eyes.I absolutely adore her chocker.
  It is too cute! I'd definately say that her jacket has a
  70's-80's rocker look to it. It's definately the best piece of
  clothing on this doll. Just beware that it's difficult to fasten
  the velcro in the back. The velcro on my Yasmin doll's jacket is
  practically coming off! Underneath her jacket, Yasmin sports an
  undershirt labled 'Rock Angelz', with the ever-so-famous red
  glitter included. Her jeans have no rips or anything. They're
  just jeans with white stitching, red glitter, a chain half-belt,
  and little frayed bits at the hem. Now don't get the wrong idea!
  Just because this doll has a chain, leather, frays, and a
  belly-jewel(so not a tatoo!), don't go thinking, "Oh no! This
  doll portrays an image of bad things for our 'little' girls!"
  She's just a cute rock star singing inspiring songs and wearing
  totally appropiate clothing. Now, of course, if you still think
  this doll is innappropiate, it's not my place to order you to
  buty this doll. I just wanted to epress my opinion;this doll is
  safe. Anyway, her black guitar is in the same mold as Cloe's red
  one and Oriana's purplish one. It's a little difficult to
  position her guitar correctly, but not thouroughly impossible.
  Her second outfit consists of sparkly mini and rockin concert
  tee. Yasmin's ankle boots match with both outfits. And I love the
  fact that both outfits are mix-n-matchable! It rocks! Literally!
  Her accessories include:glasses, 2 sets of earrings,
  cell-phone-necklace, bracelets, star brush, lipstick,
  microphone/microphone stand, and totally-collectible displaying
  stand! You've outta have a rockin' time with this rockin doll!
  She's 100% worth the price($19.99)! Fortunately, I got her for
  Christmas. In my opinion, she's appropiate and meets the
  standards of ALL ages(notice I stressed on the 'all'). You're
  lucky if you get her! GREAT JOB MGAE! Chelsea&amp;amp;Yasmin(50%
  My Scene, 50% Bratz)over, &amp;amp; OUT!!!!! P.S.-END THE WAR!!!

  <Text category="toys_games">This set was one of the most fun
  builds I've done with Lego in a long time. As an adult fan of
  Lego, I highly recommend this set for its minifigures and part
  selection. They are excellent additions to any castle or general
  builder. As a builder, the final construction is impressive in
  size (18+ inches long), functionality (the rotisserie chicken is
  quite amusing), and playability (the sea serpent's posability and
  the incredible catapult alone are stunning). The catapult was my
  favorite part. After seeing the necrotic firing action of the
  Lego Exo-force Mobile Defense Tank's disk launcher; the
  rapid-fire, long-range Viking catapult is astonishingly fun to
  play with. The lone drawback in this set is the fragility of the
  ship's hull. It should be assembled on a hard surface (I tried to
  build it on carpet) and slid about on the floor, not carried (it
  will fold in half in the air). A few extra plate elements to
  reinforce the hull joints would probably improve this set</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">The children in our after school
  program love this puzzle. The colors are beautiful and they are
  learning about different sea creatures at the same time</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">Our daughter received this puzzle for
  her 3rd birthday. She's a puzzle nut! This became an instant
  favorite and had to be left together for all to see. The picture
  sheet in it labels all the sea creatures and it becomes a great
  way to discuss the different levels of life in the ocean. The
  coloring is beautiful - Mom and Dad enjoy it as well. It is
  extrememly well built, sturdy and can really be wiped off with a
  damp cloth. The only negative, as another viewer pointed out, is
  the darker bottom pictures. Harder for young ones to distinguish
  designs and not as visually appealing.</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">I bought this set for my son prior to
  reading the other reviews online but before I tried to set it up.
  I will admit in reading the reviews about how difficult some
  people thought it was to put together that they must be
  exaggerating...we'll apparently they were not. I tried for 10
  minutes and was covered in soap and nearly hurt myself trying to
  get the first two pieces together...so at that point I gave up
  and waited for my husbands help. The two of us spent nearly an
  hour banging the thing together with every tool we had(after we
  washed off all the soap b/c that just made getting the pieces to
  stay together impossible)and once we had the center base up I
  pushed it and it fell completely apart. We got it back together
  but there was no way I felt it was sturdy enought to let my child
  anywhere near it. So in desperation I called the ToysRUs store
  where I got it and spoke w/ the store manager. She assured me
  that this was not how it was supposed to be and that I should
  bring it back. I wasnt thrilled about that b/c it wasnt the
  easiest thing to get home in the first place...but what choice
  did I have. I asked her if they would set the next one up for me
  to make sure it worked b/c I wasn't about to go through this
  again. When I arrived at the store it was all set up and
  completely sturdy...exactly what I had wanted it to be when I had
  purchased it. Unfortunatly due to its size we had to take it back
  apart to get it home but once we did my husband had it back
  together in about 10-15 minutes with just a little banging from a
  rubber mallett...just like some of the other reviewers had said.
  So the morale of the story is...if its miserable to put together
  then its probably defective and should go back...but once its
  together properly its great....now if my son would just show some
  interest in the darn thing all would be good with the
  world!</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">My 6 year old loves this book.
  Wanting to be like her sister she is learning spanish too! This
  is a very well laid out book. enhances the ability for young
  children to learn a second language</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">My 3 year old son received this as a
  Christmas gift last year and he loves it. He explores outside and
  collects things from the yard and hauls them around in the truck.
  Must say the truck is durable, it stays out on the deck and the
  weather doesn't effect it. We hose it down to clean it, no issues
  there. Highly recommend</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">I bought this for my girls when they
  were six months old and at two years they still like the colorful
  birds! This is a great toy, well made and interesting. This would
  also be a wonderful gift</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">Our family loves this game. It brings
  out the creative side of people of all ages and is very fun to
  play. There are 5 catigories. Movies, weird laws, initials, word
  meaning, dealers choice. Everyone takes a turn orchestrating the
  game while the rest of the players make up ficticious answers.
  Then that same person reads everyones made up answers along with
  the correct answer and you have to guess which is made up and
  which is the correct. We played many times over Christmas with
  teenagers and gramdma too! Everyone was having such a great time
  we didn't want the game to be over. Turn off the TV, make some
  popcorn and re-connect with your family with this fun, no
  pressure to win game</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">Balderdash is a riot! It keeps my
  family in stitches! My entire family is so full of bull we play
  this easily. Playing Balderdash is a family tradition after
  Thanksgiving &amp;amp; Christmas dinners and everything
  in-between. Anytime there is a family gathering the Balderdash
  game comes out! My grown sons and their wives are full of bull,
  the grandkids are now joining in, but, it's tough to out bull the
  mother of bulls! Gotta Love It! Jan</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">Every human should have one of these.
  Ideally, every human should have one of these in every size and
  color available. It doesn't get any better than Etch-a-Sketch. I
  have several of them in my office, and they're wonderful for long
  meetings and work sessions</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">This lovely new set depicts one of
  America's best-loved and most popular breeds. The beautiful dun
  mare with her sparkling white blanket was created using the
  "Duchess" mold. Her alert expression and slightly wind-tossed
  mane is sure to make her a favorite with your young horse-lover.
  The sweet dark dun foal has his mama's lovely blanket and sweet
  face. Created from the classic arabian foal mold, his thin legs
  make him a bit more fragile than mother. All in all, these two
  would make a wonderful addition to any little equestrian's
  collection</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">and still loves it 7 months later! He
  even takes it camping and plays for hours outside with it. We are
  getting him more - his Dad likes to get in on it, too</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">Our entire family loved the hand held
  game, as a matter of fact we ended up buying 5 of them total
  eveyone wanted one. I would highly recommend this item to
  everyon</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">This is the best value I've seen for
  a dinosaur set. My sons love it, and several of my friends have
  gotten it for their own children after they've seen the kids
  playing with ours. The volcanoes, rocks and mat are a real plus,
  and the dinosaurs are big enough to be fun for the kids. They
  play with this set A LOT</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">My son has been using this table for
  the last 3 months and absolutely loves it. He also has the
  LeapFrog table, but gets bored with just one. This table is on
  the opposite side of our (toy-filled) living room, and he will go
  over to this for a change of pace. He loves Elmo and likes to
  hang on to his head and also mouth it. He likes to use the phone,
  which he also mouths - just assume he puts his mouth on
  everything :) - and also the little bowl under Cookie Monster. So
  why four stars and not five? I do wish the base had a bit more
  weight to it, but he can easily pull up on it without getting the
  whole toy over although we've had a couple of near tips. Also,
  the toy is a little less educational than I feel it could be
  since he is always accidentally setting off buttons with his
  arm...so he could be pressing the triangle with his finger, but
  his arm could press the Pig...and off Elmo goes oinking and
  singing about pigs. Still a great toy, with lots of entertainment
  value, and as he matures we have less accidental set-offs. I
  bought it on sale and it was worth the money</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">My son got this toy for his first
  birthday. He's now 18 months and still loves it! When he first
  got it, he immediately began to dance to the music. You can press
  certain body parts on Ernie and then he sings about them (i.e.
  eyes, mouth, ears).My son can now identify his ears, mouth and
  eyes on himself. Great toy</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">If you don't have this i feel bad
  4</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">At first it was confusing but after
  you get it, it is sooo much fun. And it's great for keeping your
  brothers out of the room</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">This is fun. Not easy for 5 and
  under, but great for the rest of us. (7 - 65). Gave us alot of
  laughs</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">BOUGHT THIS ITEM FOR MT SON, AND HE
  JUST LOVES IT. HE PLAYS WITH IT ALL THE TIME, FROM THE TIME HE
  GETS HOME FROM SCHOOL UNTIL DINNER TIME, AND FROM AFTER DINNER
  UNTIL BED TIME</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">i love the loop to hang elmo up to
  dry, and my now 14 month old enjoys drawing with the soap
  crayons, and chewing on them unfortunately. not her favorite toy
  but enjoyed</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">My son is a college student in Boston
  and excitedly brought this board game home on one of his breaks.
  "You've GOT to play this game!" he said. It had been years since
  anyone could even so much as coax me over to a table where a
  board game was being played. But I wanted to spend time with my
  son so I consented to learn it. Turns out, it was amazing! My
  husband, 13-year-old son, the bringer-of-this-new-addiction and
  myself must have played it 20 times in the 3 weeks he was home.
  The "board" is different every time you play it so nothing is
  predictable, rolls of the die dictate one's success, trading and
  strategies can get intense and the more you play it, the more you
  definitely like it. Alas! I've "settled" into Catan mode and no
  longer need to beg him to bring it home from school. I bought my
  own house copy plus the expansion so we can get visitors hooked
  on it, too. We play it all the time. Cross my heart, this is fun.
  As my son said, "You've GOT to play this game!"</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">This is a great puzzle! My son is 2
  1/2 and wants to put it together almost every day! It is amazing
  to watch him, because every time we sit down on the kitchen floor
  to do this together he can do it more and more on his own! And
  when we are done he is so proud of himself, I love it! I am
  online right now looking for more just like it</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">My 3 year old daughter got this
  puzzle for Christmas and she simply adores it. This is her fourth
  Melissa &amp;amp; Doug puzzle and I have to say she loves them
  all. As soon as she is done with one she puts it away and runs
  for another one. Keep making wonderful puzzles Melissa &amp;amp;
  Doug!</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">I read some of the reviews posted on
  this site before I bought this Doll, I saw it on Ebay but was
  afaird because of some the comments that was posted about the
  doll and thought I should buy it directly in case I needed to
  return it, But I had no problems at all other then the UBC cord
  the direction said to turn the cord one way when actually it is
  the other way, other then that I had no problem downloading
  anything and I can't wait to give this to my daughter for
  Easter</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">My almost 5 year old daughter loves
  this toy. It is easy for her to control. My 8 year old thinks it
  is boring. I don't think it has any educational value. The
  controller has a long pointed antenna with a plastic rounded end,
  so the kids have to be careful not to poke each other with
  it.</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">I am very pleased with this play
  food. It is very realistic looking and a great size - not too big
  and not too small like some of the cheaper sets. Definitely
  recommended and well worth the money</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">I bought these for my nephew as a
  birthday present and he absolutely loved it. He has a number of
  other sets bu was very excited with the content in this one. They
  were exactly what he wanted</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">Well the space is limated but I
  learned how to deal with it. The set comes with four parts
  rainforestchamber, bug chamber, aquarium , and ant colony. The
  aquarium comes with triop eggs or you can put a goldfish in. then
  we have ant colony which the air holes are a bit to big. Finally
  we have rain and bug chamber which to me are the best of all the
  four. the rain forest chamber can hold a small lizard or frog but
  since I bought this during winter I will have to wait till spring
  to catch a lizard. And we all know what you put in a bug chamber.
  Over all I rate this four stars due to small space. P.s there a
  bug catcher in it as well</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">This is a great house,got it at
  toysrus,has six ring tones at doorbell,dog,knock
  knock,jibberish,fog horn,etc.,it's so easy to assemble.all you
  need is a helper(to enjoy assembly)and a power or ratchet
  screwdriver(you need both)the stove is a little tricky to start
  but once you start the hole you can use a power drill!your child
  will love it.Swinging door/window,spongebob chair fits inside(you
  can probably get a big screen TV in there!)Great for the price
  $129.0</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">I purchased this house for my in home
  day care. So we have lots of toddlers playing with it! They love
  it! The only complaint I have is that the door falls off easily
  if the child pushes it instead of pulls it. But the kids all fit
  in there and even bring chairs. Even the one year old loves it!
  He likes to play peek a boo with the shutters. Lots of fun and
  well worth the money</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">This playset is great - my son loves
  it. You do have to be careful with the open sides - it is very
  easy to fall off. My only complaint was puting it together. The
  instructions are horrible and have no words - only pictures. The
  parts are hard to tell apart (the color-coded bolt caps all look
  the same in the instructions) and the pieces are hard to handle.
  Give yourself extra time to work through the instructions and get
  a couple of friends to help. Also, a power screwdriver should be
  a required tool to get the screws into the plastic</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">This is a single player game. Set up
  the cars according to the diagram and try to get the ice cream
  truck out of traffic. The puzzles start easy and progress slowly
  so that kids learn the maneuvering tricks without getting
  frustrated. By the end, the puzzles are a challenging even for
  adults who have not played before. Both kids love it- ages 4 and
  9. We helped the four-year-old learn the tricks by just asking
  "Whoes in that cars way?" Then "whoes in the trucks way?" until
  she reached the car that could be moved and work her way
  backwards</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">I bought this game based on the
  reviews on Amazon and I am not disappointed. Even my three year
  old enjoys this game and is capable of understanding the concept.
  The beginner puzzles are right up his alley and the expert
  puzzles are challenging enough for me.</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">When I got this house I was very
  impressed.Easy to put together.Bigger than I thought it would be
  and it is very realistic looking.My daughter enjoys this doll
  house</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">I've bought this toy for my daugther
  ( she's 6 ) and she loves it, it's a good toy to use alone, to
  share with friends or even with her parents ( myself ). It's a
  good option to the computer, she also carries this toy with her
  stuff when she goes outside</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">Not only is the 90's Game fun and
  enjoyable to play, but the questions and answers bring back
  lasting memories of movies, sports, TV shows and meaningful
  events from the decade. Correctly answering questions by relating
  them to personal memories and experiences allows all players to
  relive their experiences from the 90's. Whether you were a
  student, young adult or parent during the 90's, this game is sure
  to invoke sentimental feelings. I highly recommend it for groups
  of friends and families</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">I thought this product was very
  unique. It's not as advanced as Ipods which, is great for younger
  kids. Although, the only thing I didn't like was that it was a
  bit too small</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">My 15 month old has been playing with
  this for a few months and really likes it. He plays with it just
  about everyday. Everytime we have kids come over to visit it
  seems to be a big hit too. They all love trying to make baskets.
  The flaws are that it is loud and I wish the baseball and
  football did more or made noise. They don't get played with as
  much as the basketball part since it sings and makes crowd
  noises. Overall it's great as long as it keeps the kids
  entertained!</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">My son loves this toy. It is the
  perfect height for my 14 month old (he got it when he was 12
  months, and it was great then, too). He can play with it sitting
  or standing. He loves to make baskets, and I can teach him
  numbers as the scoreboard keeps his score. He loves to spin the
  football, and he is starting to gain enough coordination to hit
  the ball with the bat. He uses the bat it came with to hit other
  balls around the house. This toy is a family favorite</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">Amazon[.com] recommended this game
  for me, based on the fact that I love the game Set. Unfortunately
  Xactika bears a strong resemblance to "10 to 1," a game played
  with a normal deck of cards. If you already know how to play "10
  to 1," Xactika may seem derivative. After trying Xactika once or
  twice, we threw it in the drawer and just played "10 to 1"
  instead</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">Bought this for my boy who just
  turned 11. Let's just say that he totally loved it and it was the
  first present he played with. Two blinking lights on weapon. One
  light on helmet which makes the eyes glow. A little pricier than
  other Bionicles but worth it. Not too hard to put together, just
  make sure you put all of the tiny pieces in a bowl or some such
  thing so you don't lose them while assembling the guy. The folks
  at LEGO are geniuses, sure it's a franchise, but they're doing a
  great job keeping it interesting</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">I can't put it any better than the
  others before me have. I did a lot of research before purchasing
  this train and am so glad I decided to spend a little bit more
  money for a TON more quality. This is truly an heirloom train set
  that will be around longer than I will be (and I'm only 35). The
  other reviewers are also correct in advising that you shop around
  before purchasing this train set. The prices vary wildly. Yes, it
  hurts a little to spend this kind of money on a train set when
  you know there are others out there. However, the others are
  cheaper for a reason... they're junk. You simply can't do better
  than this set</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">I bought this game for my mom for
  christmas and we played it...right now it is in my game closet
  because I introduced this game to my poker friends and now we
  have "PIT" night instead of poker night. We can not stop laughing
  when we play this game. We bring this to all get-togethers and
  everyone loves it.I had to buy my mom a new PIT game because I
  take it all the time. This game is soooo much fun, the more
  people you play with the more fun it is!!! GET THIS GAME!!</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">Very complete with a lot of things to
  play for hours. My daughter still plays with it, and she is now
  four years old. Definitely it was worth it. Highly
  recommended</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">My 2 year old and 4 year old love
  this playdoh set. I recommend it highly</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">This is such a great toy for kids and
  parents. We play play doh for hours. The barrel is a great toy.
  All the item inside are really well made and they have a lot of
  cute shapes. This really is somethig fun for kids and parents to
  enjoy together.</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">My girls love the sandbox! The only
  thing my husband and I don't like is that you cannot move it once
  the sand is in it. We thought we'd be able to, but the walls are
  just flimsy enough that you can't. Otherwise, a great
  purchase</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">I bought this sand box for my son's
  1st birthday. He has had the sand box for a month and loves it.
  It looks really nice in our yard and the top has kept out rain
  and bugs. I was going to go with a cheaper sand box, but now i'm
  glad i spent the money. This is a very good product!</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">This game is so much fun!!! I do
  think that maybe it could use a few more games or maybe make
  different difficulty levels. In other words... If you are a huge
  Star Wars fan like me, then you will love this game!!! It will
  keep you occupied for at least an hour a day if you are
  determined to beat a certain level. Another thing I think it
  could use is maybe a game-save function or something... Anyway,
  GREAT GAMING EXPERIENCE!!! One and a half thumbs up!!!</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">This is an excellent gaming system
  containing five acrade classics, Ms. Pac Man, which plays as
  close to the arcade as you can get, Pole Position, which the
  Joystick turns as a stearing wheel, again close to acrade action,
  Mappy, where you are a mouse trying to get a cat on the loose in
  a museum (much like original mario brothers), Galaga-an updated
  space invaders type game with more difficult ships to hit, and
  finally Xevious, where you are commander of a ship blowing up
  attaching enemies over land and see (plays like Tiger Heli for
  nintendo, or other games like this). I use this on my old call
  room tv with mono av jacks available, works great, passes the
  time with family friendly games. These games are much better than
  some of the new expensive games. check this out, you will be
  pleasently surprised, and for around 6-12 dollars, good deal.
  Runs on 4 AA batteries, then plug and play</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">My son got this for christma when he
  was 10 months old. From day one he loves to push it around the
  house. He's 13 months old now and he can get on to ride it. His
  friends love it also.</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">Someone gave these to us when my son
  was 9 months old. He loved holding them and it has been fun
  watching him learn to "color" and develop his hand-eye
  coordination. He is now 22 months old and we've just used them up
  and I had to buy the Crayola tub crayons because I couldn't find
  these at Toys R Us. The Crayola crayons are thinner (which
  doesn't hold up as well to toddler abuse) and have more colors,
  but I like these better because they come with the ducky sponge
  to wash the crayon off the walls (my son loves that part, too).
  These crayons are a surefire way to get my son into the
  bathtub</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">The nephews loved it. We sent it to
  them along with other gifts for Christmas. Turns out the twin 8
  year olds found this to be their favorite gift. The light up part
  was pretty cool but they did have some trouble bouncing the ball.
  When the lights went out the fun really happened. Everything went
  well even when it turned into tackle-basketball. Not their mom's
  favorite sport but no harm... no foul.</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">This hoop is tight, but wene you
  shoot it makes a ton of noise. If your planing on buying this be
  aware of a lot noise. Also the hoop, and the net sometimes come
  off</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">This Eeyore is so much fun. I gave it
  a 4 because the little butterfly is too easy to lose, but if Mom
  and Dad are diligent to keep the part with the toy and teach Baby
  to keep them together, I think there is also something to be
  learned with this, plus the fact that he is so DARN cute and the
  little voice is sweet and soothing. "GOOD NIGHT BABY." Just
  precious. Baby quickly learns that Eeyore only works with the
  butterfly rattle. I thought the ears would be easy to break, but
  they have taken a lickin' from my grandson and still work. Nana
  Ka</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">My 2 year old daughter (and our 4
  &amp;amp; 6 year old neighbors) LOVE this toy! I had it up during
  my daughter's second birthday party and all the kids loved it! It
  holds up very well and I have only had to refill it once (and
  that was only because one of the kids managed to pull out the
  plug). Some of the balls are not 100% inflated but they still
  roll just fine and my daughter has the best time with this. It is
  up in the living room and not outside so that keeps it from
  getting any other holes. I would recommend this for any kids
  around 4 or under. The one thing to keep in mind; the kids may be
  afraid of it at first; my daughter was terrified of it the first
  day but by the second she loved it and now she spends a lot of
  time in there</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">Sooo cute. Santa gave my 7 y.o.
  daughter the dog and cat versions of this game. She and I have
  already spent several hours playing with her "pets". Unlike the
  earlier pets, there is more to do than just care for your pet.
  There are games, activities and interactions with pet friends.
  There is a whole village of homes and places to visit. You
  collect stickers throughout your adventures. For instance there
  are 29 stickers available for making friends. It is represented
  by a heart sticker. Everytime you collect a sticker, you are
  taken to your sticker book and it indicates how many stickers are
  available and how many you have obtained. There are three
  exterior buttons for use to play with, groom and feed your pet.
  When your pet ignores you, it means it is time for grooming,
  playing or eating. Sometimes your pet will suddenly disappear and
  then reappear at their potty mat having left a little
  undesirable. My daughter thinks that is hilarious. Kids! The only
  drawback is that the screen does not light up for play while
  travelling after dark. Maybe they'll improve upon that in the
  next versions</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">The game pieces are very good
  quality. I found the cards to be challenging. The game was well
  worth the money.</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">My 2yr old got this one and another
  Imaginext Dinosaur for Christmas and this one is by far his
  favorite. He loves attaching the cart to the Mammoth and moving
  them around. The reason why I give 4 stars instead of 5 is
  because the button to push down on to make the noise is not real
  easy. When you think it's pushed down all the way, you have to
  push a little harder to get it to make noise. Also, like the last
  reviewer I think the wooly hair is going to attract dirt and not
  stay very clean. But overall the toy is fun and very
  durable</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">These coins are nice and heavy...
  they have a good feeling when you hold them or keep them in the
  pouch. My son uses them like Jack Sparrow does in the movie so he
  doesn't die in our play battles. However, they seemed rather
  expensive after buying them and having them shipped. It would be
  cheaper to use silver dollars or other real US currency that is
  large and heavy</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">My 6 &amp;amp; 8 year olds sons
  received this toy for Christmas. They are HUGE Pokemon fans so
  just the fact that it has Pokemon pictures on it made the toy
  worth it. Fortunately, it also happens to be fun to play. 2 to 4
  players try to allow the fewest balls possible past their own
  paddles. The fewest points wins. Each player has their own
  scorekeeper for up to 5 games. Setting up the game after every
  round gets a little tedious, however it's not so bad if everyone
  helps. The 2 best things for me are that I don't mind playing
  (unlike the actual Pokemon cards which are a boring nightmare for
  me!) and it doesn't require batteries!! My 3 year old daughter
  likes to play too although she loses every time. We just don't
  tell her. If your kids like Pokemon, this is a good toy</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">My 4 year old son loves all things
  Rescue Hero! His grandparents got the MACC for him almost a year
  ago now. I run an in home day care,so I watch not only my son but
  2 other 5 year old boys and my youngest son, 13 mo and a 10 mo
  old boy! They all love it! This thing has stood up to all of
  their adventures! One of the kids I watch was thrilled when he
  got the same MACC for his birthday from his parents! He had just
  went on and on about it, and they couldn't resist. It is very
  large, but we already had the firetruck, police car, helecoptor
  and about 30 rescue heroes, so,in the words of my son, we just
  HAD to get this too! I highly recommend this toy for all ages!
  Great imaginary play</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">This toy was an instant success with
  my son, who is six. He figured out how to put together the track
  in minutes. Unlike other construction toys, Skyrail is not
  limited to one or two designs. My son can create endless
  configurations, including loop-the-loops that really work. This
  toy is also easy to disassemble. The track and connectors seem a
  little flimsy, but so far -- after many, many uses -- none of the
  pieces has broken</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">When I was a little girl I stood
  along beside the table and watched the adults play. This was how
  I learned how to play the game. I have now been playing rook for
  about eight years and loved the style of cards shown above (90's
  style). Unfortunately, they have changed the style of the cards
  on us and I would like to purchase the 90's style. If any come
  availible to purchase please be sure to email me and inform me of
  this so that I can buy some. I really dislike the new style of
  cards and all of my friends and family agree with me</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">Just as promised. Our son loves the
  Wiggles plate, bowl and cup! Perfect</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">As usual, this is another quality
  product from Power Wheels. The fit and finish is perfect and the
  overall quality is excellent. The only upgrade I can advise is to
  buy the Power Wheels 12V quick charger for the battery</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">We bought our youngest son the pirate
  ship seven years ago when he was four. He is now eleven, and is
  asking for this new updated ship. He has played with the old one
  for years, outside in the pool, inside, along with the big king
  castle, and countless other sets that we have. Yes, Playmobil. is
  delicate, and young children can be taught how to play with it,
  there are alot of small pieces, but like Lego, it will and does
  encourage a child's imagination, rather than stifle it. We have
  Castles, western forts, city sets, boats, all of it! It does take
  time to put together, but some of the best memories are of me and
  my boys putting together some of these intricate playmobil sets
  the day after Christmas! When you buy toys for your kids, don't
  look at a toy and say "what does it do", rather look at a toy and
  ask "what can my child do with this toy"? Playmobil has been one
  of the toys that my three boys have stayed with along with legos
  well past Christmas, much more, than anything else. I am keeping
  all of our collections for our grandchildren.</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">I purchased this pirate ship for my
  son's fourth birthday. This is by far the most popular toy in our
  house! My 8 year old son and 6 year old daughter also love this
  toy. There are so many items that come with the ship - from canon
  balls, swords, treasure chest full of goodies, food, animals and
  even jewelery for the pirates - they are never bored. My four
  year old plays on his own, or with his friends, and when all
  three are home they all play together. Definitely worth the
  investment for the amount of joy this toy has brought to our
  home!</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">My 6-year-old got this for Christmas
  and he and his 4-year-old brother love it! They enjoy doing the
  battles and coming up with different monster combinations. It
  teaches strategy since they have to figure out which combinations
  work best. My kids also like to just play with the figures by
  themselves like action figures. A piece of advice though: This
  game only comes with 2 figures so you really must buy additional
  figures or it won't be much fun since the point is to create
  varying combinations. Therein lies the problem - or at least MY
  problem! I can't find the extra figures for this thing! Luckily,
  they were available around Christmas so I got some then, but now
  I can't find them in stock anywhere. Also, I have not had any
  durability problems although I had some sound quality problems on
  the 2nd day. Fortunately, it turned out that all I needed was new
  batteries. You really need alkalines for this game. Overall, it's
  what my boys think though and they ADORE this!!!</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">Not only will this be a fun gift for
  our 5 year old grandson, it will be a fun gift for our 65 year
  old brother-in-law! Quite realistic looking! It works great on
  smooth surfaces, but doesn't do well on carpet. Our dogs got a
  big kick out of it</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">There are always problems with an any
  type of bed, even an inflatable one. I am actually 21, but I
  don't have a credit card so I had to use the kid review instead.
  This bed is great. Of course there are problems, but they don't
  outweigh the good that the bed has. It is great to sleep on, you
  can carry it on trips, you can have it on another bed that is in
  one place, or on the floor. I do admit, it is somewhat hard to
  set up, but it is worth the effort, for the sleep is
  unparralleled. I sleep on it every night and I have had no
  problems with it at all. I recomend this bed to be for ages 5 to
  adult because of the gap it has between the side and the
  mattress. What is the most important thing of all is this: Is the
  person you bought it for happy with it</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">we love the accessories this item
  comes with but the doll itself is... we have mixed feelings about
  her. my daughter, 4, loves her hair because it's so different
  from all her other barbies, but she hates her feet. her feet are
  way too big, even bigger than ken's (my daughter tried making her
  wear ken's shoes but it didn't work). another thing we love and
  hate about her is that her hands can move like pregnant midge
  (good), and she has a bigger body than most barbie dolls (bad
  because she can't use the other doll's clothes)</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">I originally bought this monkey on
  vacation. I showed it to my son and he grabbed it and hugged it.
  How could I not buy it for him doing that? It was so soft and
  cuddly and the feet are like beany babies. I eventually ordered a
  2nd one from Amazon for my parents house. So now I don't have to
  drag it from house to house. As he gets older, he is liking it
  more and more</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">My 5 year old daughter got this
  monkey when she was little and has slept with it every night
  since. My 1 year old daughter loved her big sister's monkey so we
  had to get her one of her own. She loves it and sleeps with her
  monkey every night now</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">I got this for my 15 month son. HE
  REALLY LOVES IT! He doesn't use it as a ride-on yet (more fun
  will await!), but he pushes the car from the back handle
  everywhere inside &amp;amp; out. there are alot of buttons which
  make sounds and some have the car talk back. The "oil change"
  sounds are his fav. HE also enjoys the toy phone(when you put it
  in the slot it rings and the car answers!) There is also a small
  storage section under the seat.. The only thing I wish it did
  have was a horn sound instead of one of the many car's sayings.
  For the price it is a great interactive toy!! And for a boy who
  usually is not big on his toys for very long, this still captures
  his attention months afterward!.oh, and this toy can take a
  beating! No complaints whatsoever! A great find</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">I run an afterschool program. This
  game is a big hit with the 3rd through 5th graders. They play it
  so much I bought an extra game in the tin. They can't get enough
  of it</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">This is a quality product. Good
  detail. Holds air well, ready to blow up and hang from attached
  loop. An excellent buy</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">I bought this for my children's room
  which has an outer space theme. The planets are nicely done and
  look great. No, they don't glow in the dark all night long... but
  who wants their kids room lit up all night anyways?!?! They
  certainly glow long enough for both of my boys to fall asleep! We
  have a round ceiling light which I put triangular "rays" around
  which is now our SUN. I'm giving this 4 stars ONLY because I
  agree about the sticker stars... yeah... they kinda stink. BUT,
  the plastic glow-in-the-dark stars are easy to find (I've even
  seen them in pharmacy's) and inexpensive. We put up 2 packages of
  the plastic ones and added the sticker stars from the package. It
  gives the effect of stars which are closer and farther
  away!!</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">The 3-D Solar System is great. I
  rated it 5 stars because I knew there was no sun, so this product
  was exactly what I expected. Easy to hang up, glows well, my 6
  year old son is very happy with it! A sun would be nice, but
  still well worth the money</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">This is the ultimate in home laser
  tag fun. It has great range and accuracy for hours of exciting
  but harmless fun. Get your kids away from the TV games and into
  the real (figuratively speaking) thing. If you have, two kids
  make sure you but at least 4 guns. Once you receive them, you'll
  experience the need for the two extra guns. Everyone who sees
  them will want to play. Great toy, thanks Amazon.</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">I just got the Laser Tag Master
  Blaster a few days ago and I love it. I've had my eye on it ever
  since I got the Deluxe for my B-day back in September. I was
  looking on Amazon so frequently for the price to drop that I got
  tired of watching so I stopped for a few months. Then spring came
  and I got into playing laser tag again with my little brother. I
  was suddenly filled with an urge to buy the LTMB. I looked back
  on Amazon and...BOOM! 60 percent off! 20 BUCKS! I told my mom and
  dad about it and they said that I could get one. So the next day
  we began the ordering process on Amazon, through Toys R Us. We
  checked the shipping charges and...BAM! 15 greens! So we just
  figured on our next trip into town we could just go to Toys R Us
  and see if it would be the same price. It was (minus the 15 bones
  for s&amp;amp;h). So we picked up a few and went home. After
  reading the instructions a million times and doing a few tests I
  finally figured out how they work. I also found out that they are
  very much like the Deluxe, except for the shoulder stock, the
  sights, the fully automatic feature, the 3 shot burst, the shot
  range, the text messages, and who could ever forget the rocket.
  Let me explain the Laser Tag Master Blaster to you: This large
  tagger is much better for a very large playing field. The Deluxe
  and the IRT-2X models are better for smaller areas. The LTMB's
  laser has a shot range of up to one thousand feet. The laser has
  three different shot types: the single (fire one shot), the
  3-burst (fire a burst of 3 shots, no overheatage), and the fully
  automatic (fire non-stop). You can also send text messages (up to
  10 characters long) to your teammates and opponents.
  Retreat...Behind You...Gotcha...Ouch! The rocket is awesome. Just
  load, pump, and launch, simple as that. With just twenty pumps
  the rocket can sail over forty feet, blasting everyone in a 15 to
  20 foot radius. There is a lot more to the LTMB but it would take
  to long to type, so you'll just have to figure it out for
  yourself.</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">This product was highly recommended
  by a school teacher in the UK as a great teaching tool. It was
  well received as a gift by the children and their parents. An
  excellent math teaching tool that the children love. It is
  portable, user friendly and has something for those on many
  different levels, so much so that one father, an engineer, loves
  to play the game by himself when travelling and is equally
  enjoyable to his 7 year old son, as well as a game that they can
  play together. Math Whiz is a tool that creates a friendly math
  experience which can be used for many years as the upgrading
  levels will remain a challenge</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">I bought this for my nephew's first
  birthday and my sister told me that he loves it. When he gets up
  from a sleep it is the first thing he wants to play with and with
  him being at the stage where he is trying to stand up; it is a
  great motivator to encourage him to stand. Your kids will love
  this toy and the sounds and lights will keep your child amused

  <Text category="toys_games">...and they are working out great
  with our Thomas Layouts. Melissa &amp;amp; Doug products continue
  to impress me with their high quality and typically provide great
  educational value. These are educational and your children will
  learn things like Police Station, Fire Station, Hospital, School,
  Town Hall, Grocery Store, and Post Office. There are several
  different shapes too, including squares, rectangles, triangle,
  and the various signs. The buildings and most of the roof pieces
  only have the building design on one side. The trees, ambulance,
  fire truck, and mail truck are large and double sided. The
  various street signs, and passenger cars are a little small, and
  as the box states ages 3+ and up, I would consider these smaller
  pieces a choking hazard. The larger pieces are enjoyed by both my
  1 yr old and my 3 yr old. The rectangles are the largest piece in
  the set and measure 4 3/4 by 2 1/4" approx. Squares are roughly 2
  1/4 x 2 1/4". These blocks are not as heavy as I expected, but
  still nicely made, and bright colorful additions to playsets like
  Thomas/Brio train sets. If your children don't insist on the real
  thing, this is a great way to save some money and still buy a
  quality product. The only drawback is the wooden storage box
  doesn't come with a sliding plexi cover like the Melissa
  &amp;amp; Doug pizza set or beading set does. That would be
  really nice for storage and secure those little pieces that we
  don't use</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">This game is very easy to learn. Each
  of the 16 playing pieces has 4 attributes, height (tall &amp;amp;
  short), color (white and brown), shape (circle &amp;amp; square),
  and hollow/solid. The goal is to get 4 of the same attributes in
  a row (for example, you could have 1 tall white circle, 1 short
  white circle, 1 tall brown circle, and 1 short brown circle in a
  row, and that would be a winning set because they are all
  circles, even though they vary with respect to the other
  attributes). The catch is that your opponent picks the piece you
  have to place on the game board. This game is similar to SET, in
  that you are trying to make winning patterns across several
  attributes. It is different because you are also trying to block
  your opponent from making winning patterns. I do wish this game
  were less expensive so that more people can enjoy it. Not
  everyone can drop $30 for a game. It is a beautifully made wooden
  game, but it would be just as much fun if it were made of
  something inexpensive and priced under $10. Nevertheless it is a
  game worth owning. And, for trivia buffs, this game was
  futuristic enough to appear in an episode of Star Trek Voyager
  :)</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">This game is very exciting for my
  son, he is five, I am teaching him to read his blends and this is
  a great reinforcer. I enjoy watching him do the math (one with
  the coins) as well as watching him make words.</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">It is fun! And most importantly
  educational. It has a game where you have to put the exact amount
  of money in the game slot. My kids like that part. They are 6 and
  7 and ask me all the time if they can play their spongebob game,
  we are a two leapster family but they have to share their
  cartridges. Next year my youngest will want one too, I am sure,
  as she wants to play theirs,but she is just too little yet,
  another year she will be 4 so will check into getting her one of
  her own then..</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">I don't know why poor Scrat got so
  many bad reviews. My kids absolutely LOVE this toy. They laugh
  hysterically every time and they're 4 1/2 and 7. He does have a
  tendency to fall down and doesn't scoot very well. But the laugh
  factor alone makes this well worth the money.</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">Ok, this toy does not deserve 5 stars
  but the other reviews were far too harsh. The first 30 minutes of
  my chihuahua terrified by this thing were worth the price. As a
  stuffed animal it's very cute but not too cuddly because it's
  hard plastic under the fur. I love scrat in the movie and the
  sounds this thing makes are quite funny at first but the do get
  boring soon unless you have a family pet to terrorize like I do.
  Here's another trick. Put Scrat on a pillow with your hadn behind
  him so you can make him move and wiggle his tail without being
  seen, then have someone bring in the family pet. When I lunged at
  the dog's feet he screamed as being run through a meet grinder.
  This may sound cruel but I assure you the dog was not hurt and
  now enjoys showing Scrat who's the boss whenever we turn him
  on</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">My nephew Cooper put on his superman
  suit right away. He especially liked the suit is inflatible. Good
  choice and excellent price</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">Makuta is Sooooooo cool! I love his
  giant staff/pitchfork.I think he is one of the best Bionicles
  there is! Probably the only thing that stands in his way is the
  exo- body special Bionicle</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">My three girls ages 3 to 7 liked this
  toy when added to their pretend food collection. We didn't use it
  as a game. You can place the different frosting and sprinkle
  combination pieces onto the different colors of donuts to make
  different varieties. Each would take a turn 'ordering' types of
  donuts and the others would 'make' them. Yes, the frosting won't
  stay on if the donut turns over but fits in easily and works
  great on a plate for pretend play! Box is flimsy but we just keep
  all the pieces in our general play food bin so not an issue.
  Would buy this again. Great for kids with imaginations</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">Puchased for my grandoughter who is 5
  years old. She liked very much playing the puzzle. Only thing we
  didnot like the quality of side parts gone bad very
  quickly.</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">I was very pleased with the light
  sabers, I gave them to my two grandsons for Christmas and they
  loved them, they were made very well, my grandsons are 7 and 5
  years old and they played pretty rough with them, they had lots
  of fun with them</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">I have been in love with this game
  ever since I first played. It was a favorite at choir parties
  over the holidays in Chicago. Since I have moved, I keep one copy
  at my permanent address and another at my vacation home. It is
  great for all ages. We are very loose with the rules and find
  teams the most fun. It doesn't matter who wins. As long as we
  play, play, play...we laugh, laugh, laugh!</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">I was recently in the play Alladin,
  and whenever there was a break, the whole cast would gather to
  play "Encore." We used songs from the musical we were in-and talk
  about a boatload of laughs! It's a blast! Everyone loves it,
  because everyone gets involved, and has a great time. This is a
  fabulous party game! Buy it now</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">i wrote some reviews of lila doll
  saying she is my favorite but this one is extremly pretty. her
  face is so pretty and all her clothes and cute. i say diffrent, i
  say that lila is better than polly! lila also comes with a cute
  horse and carrige. wow how can you think spending 25 dollars on
  polly will be better when you can spent less than 10 dollars on
  lila and get a real cute and worth-the-money doll</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">Most Old Skool fans are angry he's
  not a VW Beetle anymore. I kinda never liked beetles anyway, so
  Im happy with the new unlicenced thing. It looks like a mix of a
  MINI and a Peugeot. He transforms better than most, the picture
  does'nt do him justice, it makes him look stiff. Actually, for
  how bulky he is, he's amazingly bendable, I particularly like
  that his "door/shields" are'nt attached to his arm, their on a
  cuffling that rotates so they wont be too awkward like many of
  the others with "door/shields". The Jetski Jetpack adds an
  unneeded extra flair to an already awesome robo mode. And as an
  extra retro touch It has a tempurture sensitive decal on his
  chest/top of the car that must be held for a minute before it
  will reveal the autobot logo [just like his original 80s
  version]. I DO wish he had come with some sort of weapon, but I
  have a few other transformers from this same generation that
  don't really need BOTH that THEY came with. What's even MORE
  awesome for me is that I bought this at the grocery store, as one
  of the very few toys they had in thier christmas section, for $10
  if your looking for just any ONE good transformer, bumblebee is a
  good choice. If you have Optimus, this one looks great standing
  beside him. Transformer fans Don't Delay, pick this one up! I
  can't wait to see movie's camaro bumblebee in july</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">I was very pleased with this product,
  it covered the back seat and has a handy little pocket to put
  bottles,wipes,dipers in. I have brought another two for the other
  car</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">My daughter purchased this with
  Christmas money and it did not work at all. We reported this to
  Amazon and they took care of immediately. I was very impressed!
  Now we have a new toy that she loves that works great. It is fun
  to play with and a storage container when she's finished.</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">My 8yo dd received this for her bday.
  She loves it. It has lots of storage space insde for all her
  Polly Pocket goodies. It's also quite sturdy. One of the levels
  got bent the wrong way and I was able to put it back and it still
  works</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">A "Jewelry Box" for your little girls
  polly pocket accessories. My daughter received this as a gift for
  Christmas and loved it! Would be perfect if it was just a little
  bigger but is definitely worth the money</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">It's amazing how much a child learns
  by having access. We are an American family living in Germany and
  felt my 5 year old would have a greater understanding of where we
  live and where our extended family lives</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">Even though I'm convinced that all
  monitors work differently in different locations, this model has
  treated us well. We got this monitor (with dual receivers) for my
  first daughter 3 1/2 years ago and it was always clear &amp;amp;
  crisp. Reception was perfect in the basement, in the frontyard,
  in the backyard...even at the neighbor's house. One of the
  receivers konked out after about 2 years but we survived with
  only one. The second receiver finally stopped working last week
  &amp;amp; after doing waaaaayyyy too much internet research, I
  decided to go with the same, trusty, inexpensive monitor and it
  works great! I've never slept with a monitor in our room (because
  our babies stay with us for a long time) so I don't know about
  nighttime quirks. I keep the monitor in our kitchen area to
  listen for the little one waking up from naps....and to spy on
  the girls when they play upstairs without me. :) Baby #3 is on
  the way &amp;amp; I'm sure this monitor will last another 3 years
  until we don't need it anymore. So, $40 over the course of 3
  children isn't bad!</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">My husband and I travel a lot and
  someone told us about this on one of our last cruises.. We
  actually watched 2 people playing it as well. So my husband
  actually remembered the name of this game and got this for me for
  a Christmas gift. Surprised me!! We plan on taking it with us on
  all our trips. We will be able to use it on cruises, on planes,
  wherever we may have to play the waiting game. We know its good
  for 2 people on up!!! It seemed like a fun game</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">I received this promptly and in time
  for vacation. Was great for the kids in the car. They loved the
  stencils that came with the board. Many hours of fun. They like
  that they can make skid marks with the Lightning McQueen
  car</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">I bought this for my 5-year old
  daughter. She really enjoyed using it and actually enjoyed the
  challenge of having to figure out the answers in the shortest
  time possible. The different levels of difficulty are useful so
  she can keep using it over the years</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">My son absolutely adores all his
  Thomas the Tank Engine stuff. What can I say? Edward the Blue
  Engine is a fine addition to any child's collection</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">I BOUGHT THIS DOLL FOR MY 5 YEAR OLD
  GRANDDAUGHTER. SHE LOVE'S THIS DOLL AND TAKE'S IT WITH HER EVERY
  WHERE SHE GOES.PEOPLE ALWAY'S MAKE A REMARK HOW MUCH FUN THE DOLL
  IS EVEN GROWN UP'S WANT TO PLAY WITH IT.JUST MAKE SURE THE CHILD
  YOU GIVE IT TO IS THERE WHEN YOU SET HER UP, BECAUSE THE CHILD
  WILL HAVE TO ANSWER THE QUESTION'S THAT ALLYSEN ASK'S.SETTING HER
  UP WAS VERY EASY.SHE TRUELY IS A INTERACTING PLAYMATE.I WOULD
  HIGHLY RECOMEND THIS DOLL</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">Bought this one recently for my eight
  year old (and myself) to enjoy and it truly took only a few
  minutes to explain it to him and we were off and loving it. More
  challenging than checkers and less complicated than chess makes
  it a very accessible game for an eight year old yet not too easy
  or complex such as can be the case for those two aforementioned
  games. I highly recommend it as it can help your child in a
  number of ways in terms of concentrating and focusing, thinking
  spatially, understanding the consequences of a move or moves, and
  introducing the concept of strategy</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">My six month old grandson loves these
  toys! They are perfect for the teether and he loves the colors
  and noise. They hold his attention for much longer than some of
  his other toys. They are easy for him to hold and shake. I would
  buy them again in a minute.</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">My son and I thoroughly enjoyed
  assembling and learning about how robots work. This kit may be
  frustrating for one adult or child to assemble. The screws
  require more 'adult strength' (he would start them and I would
  finish) and some of the instructions might need at least 3 hands
  to hold and assemble. But hey, that is why it was so enjoyable -
  we did it together! It is fun now to watch him play with it and
  tell everyone 'my Dad and I built this'</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">Samantha is 13 months and walking.
  She enjoys pushing the baby around in the stroller. She thinks
  she is a big girl. She pushes her baby, her elmo, and any animal
  we ask her to take for a walk.</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">I love the upstairs. It is so fun.
  Because it has an upstairs, you can move up a level twice as
  fast. It is more fun to play when you also have the Love 2 Shop
  Malls. (quoted from my 10 year old daughter</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">Breyer makes such authentic lifelike
  replicas of the worlds most beautiful horses. My daughter is in
  horse heaven. The detail is so accurate that my daughter noticed
  even the footpad of the horses were unique to each one</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">This is a very handy product to have
  around for our 3-year old if the batteries happen to die while
  traveling. The AC adapter is a life-saver for long car trips.
  Just as an aside note, the adapter does NOT look like the one in
  the picture. It is gray-and-orange, like the adapters you seen in
  the store</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">This is my daughters first "real"
  baby doll. She is almost 2, and I have never seen her love
  another toy like this one. She loves to give the baby kisses and
  feed her with the bottle it comes with, and I bought an extra
  outfit so she can change the baby for bed. This doll is really
  pretty compared to other baby dolls I have seen lately. The skin
  is a very soft, nice feeling plastic with a cloth torso, and
  smells like sweet baby powder! I was pleased when I was able to
  wipe off dirt that was on the dolls hand really easily. I love
  all the accessories that you can get for the Little Mommy dolls
  too. I highly recommend this one</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">We recieved this bed as a
  hand-me-down from a friend's child who used it until he was eight
  (would not give it up sooner). My son recieved the bed at
  two-years-old and is now four. This bed is durable! The bed we
  have is twelve years old and looks brand new. It is so easy to
  wipe clean. My son feels that his bed is special and just adores
  it. He sees "regular" beds other places and feels so proud that
  his bed is a blue race car. I have a feeling he'll want to stay
  in this bed until his feet are hanging off the end. Five
  stars</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">I brought this toy to aid my two-year
  old in learning how dress</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">I think I missed the boat on this
  one; I bought it for xmas for my 13 month old and the only real
  play it gets is when my daughter and her 3 year old brother take
  off the "play top" and sit inside it! They think thats fun but
  thats about it</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">I purchased this as a Christmas Gift
  for my 1 year old nephew. Very pleased with the online price
  through Toys-R-Us and Amazon.com, it was $50.00 less than in a
  retail store! Very prompt shipping, had to be put together but
  not difficult with common household tools. Very nice quality
  wagon, top of the line and well worth the money. Rubber tires
  give a more comfortable ride for small children. I also purchased
  the pad set. Fits perfectly, looks great nad comfy ride, but be
  sure to purchase the pad set for the Model #29 All-Terrain Cargo
  Wagon (BP-29), as other pad sets will not fit! Very nice
  onverall. Don't hesitate to buy!</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">you can purchase this item at most
  any Walmart or K-mart ETC...for $4.99 or cheaper..toywiz is
  ripping people off!!!</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">These books have all been wonderful
  tools that my son has not only enjoyed very much, but they've
  helped him make needed improvements with many academic skills.
  This on encourages reading and it's another great example of a
  fantastic and useful interactive product</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">I had to buy my 4 year old a new Leap
  Pad after his old one wore out. He is currently obsessed with
  Spiderman so I grabbed this one. I didn't realize it came with
  the Spiderman book I was going to buy him soon anyway (saved me
  $15)! So far the new Leap Pad and Spiderman book have been a huge
  hit!</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">this elmo item is pretty cool. if ur
  child is an elmo fan then im sure you know how annoying these
  elmo doll/ toys can be.. oh jeez the voice is so loud and it
  echoes.!!! however this one is far less annoying than the rest
  because he hums when you plug his mouth -- im srry i meant ta say
  when you give him his pacifier (lol)-- you just hear an adorable
  hum sound. Overall this is a cool gift. Theres is an off button I
  only wish there was a lower volume button for early morning
  play</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">we have hardwood floors so i bought
  this together with Playzone. i'm pleased with these mats --these
  made it safe for the frequent falls my baby went through when he
  was learning to crawl and pull himself up. now i put these mats
  beside his bed, softening his occasional 'dreamy falling off' his
  bed</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">This wagon was easy to put together.
  We use it frequently when picnicking outdoors and going to the
  park. It is big enough for my 2 year old to lie down and take a
  nap. It was also large enough to hold our lunch cooler and my
  daughter. It is very easy to pull around and is very
  durable</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">We absolutely love this wagon! My 2yr
  old will ride as long as I want to walk, stop, detour,
  whatever...she's glued! It is huge &amp;amp; on the heavy side.
  But also huge(you can carry so much/many children)w/ great
  quality &amp;amp; durability. I can easily see us w/ this wagon
  for years to come &amp;amp; would suggest it to anyone
  comparing.</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">The game is fun to play even if
  you're not a NASCAR fan! Love it</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">I purchased the Parents Magazine
  version first and my one year old son didn't play with it much
  but after watching him go crazy at a friends house with this
  Hasbro toy I purchased it and he has been playing with it ever
  since. The buttons are placed in such a way that he can hold it
  with both hands and press buttons at the same time. He also
  enjoys teething on the keys. I highly recommend this product for
  mothers who want to hold on to their own keys</Text>

  <Text category="toys_games">This McQueen is different than the
  regular McQueen - slightly darker maroon with a white swoosh on
  both sides - it is supposed to be the McQueen that appears after
  the Radiator Springs team fixes him up...my son was slightly
  disappointed though because the wheels were not white. I found
  out there was yet another McQueen with the whitewall tires. Go
  figure</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">I say that because the paint on these
  cars chips VERY easily. The Hamm car was already chipped sealed
  in the package. My son's Matchbox cars, which get tossed into
  their basket quite regularly, don't seem to chip near as easy as
  the Cars ones do. Never-the-less, kids don't care. Though, my son
  (who is only 3-1/2) is wondering why they didn't make a red
  Ramone or the announcer Cars (Bob and Darryl)?? Also, FOR
  COLLECTORS, the Sarge and Fillmore are shown on the back of the
  card as being sold as individual items, but on the back of the
  Hamm card, they are not shown. I have as of yet see them sold
  individually on the Supercharged card</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">My 2 year old son loves this puzzle.
  The large pieces are easy to handle, and the colorful pictures
  keep him entertained. It keeps him engaged and he's very proud
  once he's completed it</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">I like the set up. It looks like a
  daycare really appears. It is great to spur on your childs
  creativity and role playing skills.</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">i love this thing i have a verzion 2
  and there best freinds and you can go onto tama town and get
  passwords that unlock items we looked every where for one of
  these we went target no we went wal mart no until we went to my
  freinds house and he wanted trade tamas but first i keep it for a
  ltille while for other tamas get here but i think i will trade
  cuz THIS THING ROCKS</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">I enjoy playing with this toy and it
  trains me to be a good Mom. Your tamagotchi's appearance depends
  on how you care for it. Mine turned into Mametchi. Mametchi is a
  really good character to have. I have enjoyed this toy so much.
  YOU SHOULD DEFINATELY BUY IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">The v4, the newest american
  tamagotchi, is much like its previous japanese counterparts, the
  entama and uratama. This tamagotchi goes to school, interviews
  for jobs, and then has a career. Each career has its own game, so
  there are many more games on this tama than the v3. There is also
  a mail icon that flashes when your tama gets mail. [...</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">I read the reviews before buying this
  product, and I do agree that it is messy with the markers,
  suitable for children that are a little older. It is fun, and
  very cute, but a little messy to wash off. I just buy a pack of
  baby wipes at the dollar store, and let the kids clean off the
  screen with them, and then throw them out. It works wonderfully,
  and the problem is solved, since the included sponge is not very
  helpful. I would purchase this again, especially for the
  price</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">Anything Leappad is great . Its one
  of the best things to come from the computer toy area for kids
  yet. My son is ahead of his class in reading with the help of
  Leappad. At 6 he reads at a midrange grade 1 student and is
  progressing quickly. I highly recommend This and any other Leap
  pad book and toy . Most schools have dropped Phonics from the
  classrooms and Leappad has brought it back in a fun form your
  little one will love..</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">We bought this and the Sing Along
  Favorites and my 5 year old loves them both. She wouldn't have
  know many songs on the other ROM packs. This is definitely a hit
  for the younger ones!</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">I purchased the Miss Weather Dress-Up
  Set for my cousin's two year old daughter. At her birthday party,
  all the other gifts were forgotten as she sat and played with the
  Colorforms. The adults were waiting in line to play with them
  also! This set has larger pieces which are perfect for younger
  children. This is the perfect gift...inexpensive, fun, promotes
  fine motor and speech/language skills, and has educational
  value</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">I would recommend this game to any
  and everyone completely. I would have to say if there are choppy
  portions on your dvd player then it might be time to buy a newer
  dvd player. Ours was flawless ran so smoothly and it's sooo much
  fun. Most fun with multiple people but still fun with a few. I
  would only hope that in the future they put a few more games and
  also maybe full motion video instead of pictures of products.
  Never got tired of the game and like I said I recommend it to
  everyone. Thanks, B. Wolf West Chester, P</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">The game itself is actully pretty
  good. You can go through the entire Price is right game or you
  can just go to each section. Like if you just wanted to do the
  pricing games, there's that option or you can do the showcase
  showdown etc... There are times that the graphics of the game
  lag, which is kind of odd since to me since I wasn't playing it
  on a computer, but on my DVD player. The pricing games are
  'random' but you do tend to get some of the same games more than
  other games. You can technically play this game by yourself, but
  it's obviously going to be more fun the more people you
  have</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">My daughter got this for her 6th
  birthday. She absolutely loves it, as does her 3 year old sister.
  One of them is using it all the time. The 3 different tops on the
  wand are a little frustrating for my 3 year old, as she can't
  switch them out herself and comes running to have someone else
  switch the tops for her. My 6 year old has caught onto all of the
  dance moves and is able to do them along with the DVD. My 3 year
  old can't do them all, but she has a great time just doing what
  she can. Both of my girls love Cinderella, so they put on their
  dress up Cinderella dresses whenever they do the DVD. I wish
  there was a way to order just an extra mat, though, so they could
  do the DVD together instead of fighting over who gets to stand on
  the mat</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">This is a toy that my son always
  wants to play with and we've had this dinosaur for quite a while
  now. Usually, we buy our son a toy that he pleads for (he likes
  it soooooo much) and it looks like fun but then it ends up in the
  back of his closet after a few days of playing with it. This
  brontosaurus makes a booming sound with his feet when you pull a
  trigger underneath which both my sons love (4 &amp;amp; 2) and
  the included figures are great. This toy stands up to the brutual
  tug of war that accompanies our two small boys and it is quite
  the bargain at the price. I highly recommend all of the dinosaurs
  and cavemen in this series. Not only does it keep my sons busy
  (oh yeah) but it also helps built their imagination as I hear
  them tell each other all these stories about their dinosaurs.
  Imaginext has even come out with "NEW" dinosaurs in this line
  which can be found at Target or other stores (I have found that
  TRU has a limited selection).</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">It was the most popular gift on his
  first birthday. He loved pushing it, sitting on it and moving the
  small animal figures. Lots of different kinds of fun for
  him</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">This is a nice toy for kids to ride
  on. My daughter loves the little horn. There are some little
  figurines that go inside the seat which activate the music. That
  does not work well at all. There are also little toy holders for
  the figuerines but those never get used either. It's a cute
  riding toy but a lot of the features don't work well. Worth the
  buy if a family is really into the John Deere theme</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">This is a great doll--we gave it to
  our 2-year-old daughter last week and she now carries her
  everywhere, feeds her, reads to her, puts her to bed, covers her
  with a blanket, and obsessively pats her on the back and tush.
  She's quite cuddly and soft; you'll want to hold her yourself.
  You might expect from the pictures that the arms and legs would
  be hard plastic like the head, but in fact they are very soft and
  pliable, and the trunk of the body is all cloth, like a pillow,
  with a bean-bag tushie. The headband is removable but actually
  stays on there pretty well. The eyes don't have those stupid
  eyelids you usually see on baby dolls, the ones that open and
  shut when you lift the doll, and that always seem to stop working
  properly after a couple of weeks. We'll see how "Maria" holds up
  to the kind of punishment our daughter can mete out, but she
  seems pretty durable. What a great purchase!</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">I agree that the Denver reviwer is
  totally out to lunch. This doll greatly resembles my daughter's
  friend Jenny Liu. Jeeny was born in Taiwan. Chinese people don't
  look any one way and to expect them to is racist, like saying
  they all look alike. The hair ornaments are plastic but they do
  look good . The dress looks redder when you display her out of
  the box.Fabric quality is better than average for Mattel. Her
  hair is also much nicer and has more style than Mattel had been
  giving us. I think this doll bodes well for better things to come
  in this doll series.</Text>

  <Text category="toys_games">The Big Bubbler is the greatest
  bubble wand----we have had consistently huge bubbles with the
  top-of-the-line/expensive bubble solution, as well as, the
  cheapest $1.99 jugs. The only thing that didn't work at all for
  us was straight dish detergent (hey, we were desperate). My
  youngest toddler will chase the bubbles endlessly, and even a
  neighbor's preteen son couldn't resist chasing the large bubbles
  across our yard. I also like that I am playing WITH the kids when
  I make the bubbles for them vs. simply turning on a
  battery-operated machine and then standing back. If I had to
  gripe, it would only be to say that I wish the top of the wand
  (the end that holds the bubble solution) could be stood on end.
  It is hard for the little ones to keep the top from spilling
  while waving the wand; it is also tough for them to get the wand
  back into the top to get more bubble solution. We also go through
  a LOT of solution---I plan to buy a few large jugs of it to have
  it on hand. But, this seems like a minor inconvenience given how
  much fun we have all had watching the bubbles dance all over our
  yard</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">I am confused by the poor reviews of
  this product. My daughter received this toy from the Easter bunny
  this year and the whole family plus Grandparents/Aunts/Uncles
  etc. have had a ball with it. It creates huge bubbles round or
  long, that float in the air for quite a bit of time. I do agree
  that the solution runs out very quickly and it is too hard for a
  three year old to work...but for the price I have to say this toy
  is WELL WORTH IT! We also made our own solution (Granny's recipe)
  and it worked...very messy and sudsy though. I would recommend
  this product to anyone who loves bubbles</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">My 8 yr old grandson wanted this for
  Christmas but the price was over $100 so when I saw it for under
  $15 on Amazon, I got it for his birhtday in February. He and his
  9 yr old brother LOVE it! I also purchased one booster pack at
  the same time. Then I found another game and booster pack at
  Target for a very reasonable price. So he got the game system,
  two games and two booster pack of cards all for under $50.00!
  Both he and I were happy! (The only reason I give this a "4" is
  because the games are a bit hard to come by</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">I bought this game for my 7 year old
  last winter - because he loved the book so much. He quickly
  mastered the game, which requires you to earn state cards by
  recognizing certain items about each state, such as the color of
  the card, whether the capital starts with a certain letter or if
  the state nickname has a person's name embedded in it. All his
  friends liked the game when they came over, so I ended up buying
  and giving at least 6 more as birthday presents for his friends
  and for a niece and nephew. But, more than that, this game has
  spawned a further interest in geography in my son. He began
  playing with a wooden puzzle of the USA as a result of the
  information on the game cards. In doing so, he taught himself
  most of the capitals (which are also on the game cards) and the
  shapes of the various states. He continues to want to learn more
  about US geography. I highly recommend the book and game for ages
  5 and up.</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">My granddaughter loves the buckets.
  They are large and easy for little hands to pick up. They make
  great hats and are great for putting things in as well as for the
  coordination of putting them on top of each other. The colors are
  bright and the plastic is sturdy. A great gift for little ones
  and older ones as well.</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">We were very pleased with the service
  we received. Our purchases were shipped in a timely fashion and
  came in good condition</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">This is a great,simple, fast game
  that is fun for all ages</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">I don't care if it stops working
  tomorrow... my daughter has gotten so much enjoyment out of this
  in just one day that it was totally worth the money. (you can get
  them cheaper at Target though) She was always stealing the
  portable phones around the house or walking off with my cell
  phone... and now she has "her" phone she is just delighted....
  she loves when it rings and she opens it up and pretends to
  talk.... so far this phone works great, but like I said... it is
  such a cool toy I'd go out and buy a new one right away.</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">My infant just likes the crinkly
  fishy that comes with the buckets. I'm sure she will grow into
  this toy. I do wonder how I'm going to keep the felty material
  clean especially when she starts putting these things to her
  mouth.</Text>

  <Text category="toys_games">This toy is great for little boys or
  girls who love equipment. I got this item for my son 2 nd
  birthday gift and he just loves it. It is a tiny tractor and it
  is just like his grandpa's tractor so which makes him a very
  happy little boy. THIS IS A GREAT ITEM</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">While nothing beats wood blocks (in
  my opinon) we had these first, and they are fun! We like that
  they are flexible and easy for little hands to manipulate, and
  not painful if they fall on you! The only downside is that they
  are large, and storing them in the bag is like putting together a
  puzzle-they JUST fit. Storing them in a toy box fills the box
  with wasted space; so we stack them in 4 rows beside the toy box.
  It's worth the hassle if you have space for them and don't mind
  stacking them up and teaching your little one to</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">After assembling a Dora's Talking
  Cash Register that scans the wrong items, a Dora's talking
  backpack that is just plain dumb- this is the toy that scored
  this Christmas! This toy is easy for my 3 year old to maneuver
  the pony in and out of the walker and actually works like you
  would expect. Plus the pony is fun to play with out of the
  walker. My daughter doesn't even question why it only talks in
  the walker. So what if it doesn't! It will be fun to sleep with
  because it is soft and has pajamas on. I would recommend this
  toy- very cute and fun!</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">We LoVe this game. We were first
  introduced to it at our children's preschool where it fast became
  a favorite at "free choice time". The children engaged in it
  delightfully and playfully. Everyone has fun. The game board is
  durable and can be constructed differently over and over again --
  this works out so great because with all the repeated play ours
  gets the kids are not memorizing the spot the item was. I worried
  a little that it might be too competitive and those that were
  "better" at it might leave those not as quick at hunting feeling
  discouraged, BUT have not ever found that to be the case when we
  have the game out at home or at the school. The board is brightly
  colored the items are fascinatingly fun to search for. It is a
  challenge even for us BIG kids. I would recommend it highly for a
  fun family activity game</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">Transaction went well. Grandkids are
  having a blast at using the product...innovatively with lots of
  fun and excitement</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">My son absolutely loves his
  "animals". He can sit and play with the book for awhile. He's 20
  months old and knows where each picture belongs. It was a great
  gift and I recommend it! I do agree with the other reviews
  regarding the dinosaurs.</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">This is a good toy for a toddler, not
  a baby. I've used this toy in two different setting (first as a
  nanny and then as a mom) and both times, the babies were
  terrified of it. It's just too much stimulation for a 9 month
  old. The balls fly everywhere and you've got to run about after
  them to keep it going; unless of course, you've got a toddler,
  then they can run about after the balls (which seems to be half
  the fun for them). Good toy, but not until maybe 14
  months.</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">My son cannot wait to get a bigger
  set. Compared to other magnetic building sets Geomags is, by far,
  better quality although it is also more expensive</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">I purchased both of the Mega Bloks
  Pyrates Ships and have built two other Mega Bloks vessals before,
  namely the Man-o-War models from the Dragons line and they wer
  both more difficult to construct than this one so if you want a
  challege try finding them instead. The first thing I noticed when
  I opened it up was the lack of pieces in the set, almost the
  entire ship simply snaps together, a ten-year-old could do it.
  There isn't a lot of rigging like in the Playmobil series that
  will keep coming undone either. All in all it can be assembled in
  30 min to an hour. The finished products are full of detail and
  Mega Bloks has gotten better at it each time, anyone who follows
  their Dragons line will know what I mean. I'll post a review of
  the Phantom next and I caint wait to get the Privateer ship Blue
  Beard's Avenger it looked massive at Toy Fair. With the Pirates
  of the Caribbean 2 and 3 films coming out this line is sure to be
  a hit</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">My 14 mo old son just got his go kart
  today. He loves it. He loves pushing the button and making it go.
  He hasn't figured out the steering yet but we have a long
  straight entry way to our home so no need to steer yet. My 4 yr
  old daughter also loves it and fits into it just fine (about 40
  in tall and 35 lbs). She received the razor go kart herself and
  loves it but that one is outside only. They have had the best
  time today playing with the PW go kart. I agree with other
  reviewers that holding down the button is hard for little ones
  but they figure out ways to get around it. (The razor go-kart
  also has a thumb throttle control) We got the Lil Quad 4 wheeler
  for my daughter when she was one and would still ride it if she
  didn't have the big 4-wheeler. Now both kids can ride their
  4-wheelers together or their go karts. Thanks Santa for 2 great
  gifts</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">This is a great pack for a day trip

  both dance and dance, until they fall down laughing. This was
  certainly a good buy</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">Being a preschool teacher I use these
  all of the time. I have found that taking the sheets out
  individually clipping them to the easels clip to be the best way
  to work with them. Even if you don't have an easel these are
  wonderful for children of all ages. Large, unlined sheets of
  paper encourage children to be creative and to express themselves
  in a completely original way. For infants, toddlers, and
  preschoolers I will often tape the sheets to the table and let
  them color/paint/glue to their hearts delight</Text>

  child doesn't really get the games we play with it, the older
  ones do and we all have a great time. My goal was to get them to
  be active during the winter (less TV time), and this works for
  about 30 minutes. I only wish we had a bigger house so I could
  have gotten the bigger parachute. I can't wait to play with it
  outside when it gets warm</Text>

  <Text category="toys_games">These are really cute and a great
  alternative to the standard "Numbers and Letters" version of
  these foam tub toys. My 2 and 3-year old sons enjoy playing with
  them. No complaints here</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">I bought this set for my 3.5 year
  old. We have had a great time putting it together on several
  occasions in the last couple of weeks. Once put together, my son
  imagines adventures on it with the included soldiers. I am not
  very mechanically inclined but the instructions are excellent,
  well-illustrated and clear, and I had no problem with them. (My
  only quibble is that the orange sticks in the manual are a
  different shade of color from the ones in our set, and took a
  moment to identify.) At first my son just wanted to put together
  the foam walls, but the second time around he wanted to help
  constructing the walls of the castle. By imitating me, he was
  able to make duplicate versions of some simple structures rather
  well. He also figured out how to make the soldiers all by
  himself, with their arms, legs, helmets, swords and shields.
  Through doing the set I also was able to explain that you have to
  build the foundation first before you can put in the walls and
  floors, and the third time we made the castle, he was repeating
  this point to me! The drawbridge is really fun and well-done. It
  raises and lowers very smoothly. This particular set is really
  only designed to make the castle, so it's not really meant for
  making many different things like the other Superstruct sets. But
  this was our first one and I have no regrets. Assembly time was
  about 30 minutes the first time, but after you do it once it
  seems closer to 15 minutes. The pieces are high-quality, fit very
  well, and are generally a joy to handle and see. The castle looks
  great once assembled, and will impress any adults or kids who see
  it</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">I bought this wireless weather
  station as a gift. The recipient loves it. For the price, he is

  on more expensive models so I imagine in the future we will be
  upgrading</Text>

  <Text category="toys_games">Both my 3-year old daughter and my
  5-year old son (to his father's chagrin) love playing with and
  endlessly dressing Dora. Her outfits are darling and my children
  enjoy mixing and matching (or not-so-matching in some cases) the
  clothes, too. We are looking forward to adding new outfits as
  well as the armoire and bed - Dora needs a place to sleep! Dora
  is well made and sturdy, and her clothing has even been through
  the wash and no harm done. And I have to admit ... I've been
  known to dress Dora a time or two myself. We have the same
  problem with the shoes not staying on well, but it doesn't seem
  to bother my little ones at all</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">This product was exactly what I was
  looking for. I recieved it in a timely manner and the merchant
  communicated kindly and proactively with me about the shipment.
  THANKS</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">Bought this for our girls, 2 and 4.
  Huge hit, even before the batteries were put in the blow dryer.
  This set is great for several reasons, and I'll try to list the
  top few. First, the dryer actually has a little fan in it that
  whirrs loudly enough to seem real, but not so loud as to disturb
  the cat when she is getting her fur done. (uncommon for a kid's
  toy) Also, the nail polish and eyeshadow are both made to open
  and "use", but no mess. And once you have removed the inner
  packing materials, the bag is large enough for headband and tiara
  storage. A must for today's Princess. The one thing I will
  caution you about is the curling iron. If your child has longer
  hair like my girls do, it can get tangled when hair is being
  "curled". Fortunately, the curler has no moving parts, so tangles
  are discovered long before any permanent damage is done. All in
  all, a pretty sturdy little set for $15. Great for practice
  make-overs and such, but probably not for experienced princesses,
  as there is no actual make-up involved, just imagination. Perfect
  for my house! No glittery door handles or perfumed pets!</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">Why do some people call Bratz dolls
  'sluts/slutz'? Are you guys mad? They are just dolls. They are
  made of plastics. So what they wear SHORT mini skirt? They just
  DOLLS. If you hated mini skirt soooo much, well don't wear them.
  I saw many teenage celebs wear mini skirts. THEY ARE JUST DOLLS,
  okay? No need to argue if they wear short mini skirts. Anyway,
  about this doll I am totally adore her. She is very pretty and
  very ROCKSTAR material (I don't know how 2 spell.I don't care
  about her having tatoos. Lot of celeb got tatoos and she's a

  <Text category="toys_games">Fly Through Spanish is some of the
  best software for the Fly pen available. You can write a word in
  English and hear the Spanish translation, or write a Spanish word
  and hear the English translation. The translator will also spell
  out translations for you (my only complaint is that the
  translations are spelled a bit too quickly, especially if you're
  trying to write them down). The cartridge even comes with some
  games to help you learn Spanish words. Fly Through Spanish also
  comes with a booklet that has verb conjugation charts and ideas
  for games you can play. I was very impressed with the verb
  charts. They actually includes all the tenses and a chart of
  irregular verbs. Fly Through Spanish is a great tool for learning
  and practicing Spanish words. Please keep in mind that this
  software will not teach you Spanish but it is a wondeful and
  downright fun addition to a class or self-study program. I hope
  that Leapfrog releases more languages, especially French</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">Any game that gets my husband dressed
  up in a tiara and earrings while playing a board game with his
  girls, is a GREAT game! It's simple to play for anyone over age 3
  (unless the child is orally fixated- there are smaller pieces, so
  use YOUR better judgment!), is fast enough to hold a child's (and
  adult's!) interest, and let's everyone relax and not worry about
  rules- we really enjoy it and are wearing it out pretty quickly.
  It has been a great gift for other friends as well as it's not
  too well-known.</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">Santa Claus brought this game for my
  daughter for Christmas and she LOVES it! It doesn't take terribly
  long to play, so it's a great game to hold the attention of a
  nearly 5-year-old. We've even talked Dad and big brother into
  playing, and there's a (playful) fight over who has the crown.
  The perfect gift for little girls. Thank you, Santa</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">My daughter is almost 3 and she LOVES
  her trampoline. She is very curious about how Santa got it down
  the chimney, though! Not easy to put together, but could be if
  directions were clearer. Great product, great price</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">This is a well engineered product; I
  cannot call it a toy because it is much much more than that.
  After building just one of the sample setups I was able to put
  down the manual and start creatively designing and building my
  own. My daughter (3.5 years old) loves it. She really likes
  placing a marble on the run when I tell her its time to "test
  it", and I let her identify the error. The only marbles that have
  fallen off the track are due to construction errors by myself.
  After 1 day (and several of our own setups) we already find
  ourselves wanting more pieces. I suggest buying the largest set
  from the get go if you have an engineering type mind or just
  enjoy puzzles. Nice feature to note : the coloring of the blocks
  is logical; each color has its own unique function(s).</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">The quality and workmanship of this
  item was very good. I gave it to my grandson for X-mas. It was
  almost identical to the one his father had at his age. Thanks for
  a quality product</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">My toddler (22 months) LOVES this
  doll. There's something about his wide open mouth and little
  round nose that enchants her. She actually threw over Elmo for
  Ernie. I never thought I'd see the day. Ernie is carried all
  around with her, and the nose gets lots of kisses. Great toy for
  girl or boy fan of Sesame Street</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">I played this when I was young so I
  thought my 2 1/2 year old would enjoy it too. She got to pick
  which color she wanted to be, and we counted how many ants to get
  into the pants. It took a little practice, but she got plenty of
  ants in and had soooo much fun. We really had a great time</Text>

  I wanted to cancel my order. Thankfully I didn't because my kids
  love it. I have two boys 5 &amp;amp; 9 and they love bowling with

  Feburary. In the reviews, people said the toy broke soon after
  playing with it. My kids play with it all the time and we have
  not had any problems. Everything still works great; the pins, the
  sound, and the ball return.</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">I am quite fond of this character.
  Sure, he is a horribly evil dictator who wouldn't give a second
  thought to breaking you in half if you looked at him wrong, but
  you have to understand where he's coming from. As the Hulk, Bruce
  Banner focused his rage against evil to help humanity. Then there
  is a world-wide nuclear holocaust, the world is a wasteland, and,
  as the Hulk, Bruce sucks up a lot of the radiation. Fusing his
  mind to the Hulk's, I think he has a right to be a little screwed
  up and angry. This highly possible figure comes with a spiky
  crown thing and the appropriate comic book. He may not make a
  great center piece, but the figure is good looking,
  none-the-less</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">This is the only figure in the
  Apocalypse series that dose not have a variant figure. Kinda
  makes you wish it were the Sentinel series, and if you can find
  them, most of them are variants that you might actually want. I
  was fortunate enough to hit Wal-Mart at a time when the shelves
  must have been just stocked, because the racks were full, and all
  five variants were right there in front. Needless to say I bought
  all 5. But Maestro, as far as I know has had one appearance in
  the entire Marvel Universe, so what variant is even possible.
  Despite some protests that this is "another Hulk figure" this is
  not some namby pamby rehashed Hulk with screaming action, fist
  pounding, and slightly purplier pants that we've seen a dozen
  times before, but an almost entirely all new figure. One reviewer
  said the body was based on the Smart Hulk figure, but I wasn't
  lucky enough to snag one, so I don't have a basis of comparrison.
  However, he is well muscled, warty, and weathered alot like he
  looks in the included issue of Captain Marvel. And if your
  wondering just what exactly to do with him, fear not, Captain
  Marvel is to be released in Series XV near the end of this year.
  Then he can go a few rounds with your Maestro. Now ML, where's
  our Legends 2099 Spidey? (He was also in that CM comic.) He is a
  good figure, could be a little bigger, like more on scale with
  Juggernaut from Series VI, but he does come with the Apocalypse
  piece whcich is a great figure in and of itself</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">The Maestro, the evil future
  intelligent world conquering version of the Hulk, comes with one
  arm and arm tube of the mighty Apocalypse. Apocalypse being the
  kick butt 14" giant figure you can build if you buy the six
  figures in this series. Maestro Hulk has great paint and body
  sculpt with tons of detail and his muscles are so huge it looks
  like his skin may burst. His beard is scuplted and painted well
  and he comes with his crazy pointy hat that fits well on his bald
  head. He is a touch shorter than I'd like and this plus the
  swelled size of his arms and hands and his funny clothes do make
  him look dwarf like but once you get used to it it grows on you.
  Overall a really cool figure and someone to take on the first
  appearance grey Hulk from the Galactus series. Talk about alpha
  and omega</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">We looked everywhere for this float
  after borrowing one while swimming at the lake with our 11 month
  old. The nice thing about it is that it provides a safe and
  comfortable ride while allowing the child to be right in the
  water and splash around. We can swim right alongside and spin him
  around or swim underneath to come and suprise him from the other
  side. We don't have to worry much about the water being too deep
  because the float is so stable. I would say the only drawback is
  that while it inflates fairly easily, squeezing all the air out
  and collapsing the float can take a few tries. I would recommend
  this product to anyone with an older baby who wants to take their
  child for a float in calm water</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">My one-year-old son had a great time
  playing with these blocks ... He loved the colors and shapes. He
  really enjoyed knocking down my block creations. We had such a
  good time playing with the blocks that I decided to go on-line to
  buy him some. I was shocked at the price. I cannot believe [what]
  these blocks cost ... For thirty-two foam blocks?!?!?!?! Forget
  it. It's too bad that these blocks are cost restrictive; they're
  great fun, but not worth the price</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">Great slide!! No assembly required,
  just unfold and your ready for fun..perfect size for young
  toddlers. Bright colors and cute, happy carrot face. Great fun
  for indoors or out</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">After we saw the Monster's Inc.
  Movie, my daughter bedded for a book! It was wonderful when we
  found out that Leapfrog had developed a book for the leappad. My
  daughter has spend hours playing with this book, and playing the
  games in the book. It is her favorite leapfrog book</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">This is one of the most fun games
  I've every played. There are tons of belly laughs as people try
  to bluff their way through an answer to a question. I find the
  questions (and answers) are quite educational too, I've learned a
  lot from these questions. A group of family members played at
  Christmas (6 of us) and it was hilarious to watch some people try
  to come up with an answer to the question (a bluff). We even let
  our 5 year old nephew "play" and he was pretty good with coming
  up with some bluffs. Try it, it is loads of fun. I recommend a
  group of at least 4 though</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">I was so glad when my little sister
  got this game for her birthday! Unfortunaty our version wasn't
  like the version I had when I was young. For some reason the
  people stand didn't open or close very well. So while for some
  you could smack down, others you had to jiggle and wiggle to get
  to lay flat. Not only that but when we would start a new game,
  you're soppose to be able to just flip the board over and all the
  stands would flip out. Well for the red board they didn't flip so
  well, in fact only a few would flip up with out help. That could
  have been my fault when I put the pieces together. The game was
  still fun, althought it was hard teaching my six year old sister
  not to exclaim out loud that she's glad of who she got because
  she likes her hat. Although I didn't have a problem with her
  picking her person instead of doing it randomly,(like you're
  soppose too) I still love this game and forever will.</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">Cute Barbie, good for $5 with free
  shipping. Very trendy clothes, would make a good collectable
  because that will go out of style quickly I would think</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">I recently bought these 4 little Dora
  dolls for my 4 yr old's birthday. She really loves them. She
  plays with them all the time. It is a nice collection to her Dora
  stash!</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">This was my 3rd bionicle and my 1st
  Rahkshi. So far all i need for the green bionicles is Lewa the
  Toa Nuva of air, it is sold out every where. Well any way each
  Rahkshi has a staff with speacial powers, Rahkshi Lerahk's staff
  can poison anything at touch</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">I've been consistently impressed by
  the Bionicle toys from Lego, and the Rahkshi are no exception.
  Wish I was young enough to actually play with this stuff. Sigh.
  Anyway, Rahkshi take the Bionicle can-sold figures to new a new
  level of articulation. In total, joints are found at the neck,
  shoulder, wrist, hip, knee, and ankle, and the crank on the back
  swivels the entire arm assembly from side to side so you can
  whack things with the staff-like weapon each of the Rahkshi
  weilds. Then there's the opening case on the back so you can flip
  spooky little rubber leech/slug things through the air. Each one
  of these things appears to come with a miniature CD full of
  Quicktime promotional stuff for the toys, game, web site, etc.
  The voice is a bit melodramatic, but it's still kind of neat. I
  like the 360-degree rotating model of the toy you just
  bought...sort of redundant, since you can look at the one in real
  life, but nifty all the same. One thing that mildly disappointed
  me is that the Rahkshi's weapon isn't really an independanly
  existing object - which is to say that the bar held between the
  "hands" is only attached to the hands, not the heads of the
  weapon. This isn't a really big deal, except that it means you
  can't have the figure hold the weapon in only one hand. This
  could be rectified with 2 small technic pieces, of course, but it
  does mean you'd have to add extra bits to the set from somewhere
  else. Overall, a very cool build-it-yourself action figure that
  could either be set to stand looming on your monitor at work, or
  actually played with. Educational value is limited to following
  instructions and demonstration of structural principles, as in
  any Lego set. Durability seems good so far - Lego is pretty
  sturdy stuff</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">Two grandsons (4 years and 6
  years)have truly enjoyed this cartridge. Recommend it
  highly!</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">My niece is about to be two and she
  loves school buses, so I THOUGHT THIS WOULD BE WORTH A TRY. She
  loved it... hours of fun and if you are patient you could fold it
  back up and put it back in the box</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">Bought for 2 year old twins... it
  held up with about 5 kids in it and even an adult at the birthday
  party. The only thing that doesn't appear to be the greatest is
  the detachable steering wheel because with my kids it would end
  up missing in no time. Definitely a great gift.</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">This is the greatest thing, I was
  worried because some of the reviews said it was not made good and
  it was easily torn. Not only has it lived up to my 3 year old,
  but we set it up outside and all the kids come and play, it has
  not torn. It sparks great imagination. All her friends go to
  school now, this allows her to pretend with them that she is
  going also. And best of all, we can store it anywhere when we are
  done, she has even learned to close it up and put it away. I
  highly recommend this bus to all!!</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">I got this game for my then nearly
  4-year-old daughter and a year later she still enjoys playing it.
  The game is VERY simple and does not require reading. All the
  parts and pieces are high quality. It's a good opportunity to
  work with numbers and measuring, plus the game goes fast so you
  can play it quickly if needed or multiple rounds if you have the
  time/inclination. The object is to create the tallest character
  by mixing/matching 5 parts (feet, legs, body, head, and hat). The
  character pieces are brightly colored and fun and include:
  ballerina, doctor, fireman/woman, policeman/woman,
  cowboy/cowgirl, and a clown. A roll of the die determines which
  part you select. The die has both pictures and words--except for
  the WILD side which is printed in red. After the characters are
  assembled each player measures with the included ruler (you can
  choose centimeters or inches) to see whose character is the
  tallest. It's a sliding ruler with a base so the kids can
  actually fit their character inside and line up the top with the
  corresponding number on the ruler. I wouldn't recommend this game
  for kids beyond 5--it may be a little too simple. But for 3/4/5's
  it's a great game</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">I first became aware of "Eat It"
  through an article in the Washington Post. My family enjoyed
  playing the game so much that we invited the creators of "Eat It"
  to appear at an event in our local community. It is a game that
  truly the whole family can have fun playing together. My seven
  year old daughter, Emma, was thrilled to learn that one of the
  questions asked in the game was about a candy bar that was called
  "Fat Emma", and was hoping that it was still being sold,(it
  isn't). GREAT GAME</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">it's a nice pool..a pain in the ass
  to blow up without a pump but oh well. lol it's a good tuy over
  all to have and holds a lot of water. it's just hard to dump it
  all out once you're finished..that drain hole should be on the
  side and NOT on the bottom of the pool</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">I think that this was a great item -
  something unique from what I can usually find around here. My
  daughter loved it. Like any other Polly items, lots of little
  pieces but overall very nice. I was a bit miffed when I found out
  that the photo booth really doesn't take photos. I guess I should
  have thought about that a bit more. Overall, it's just
  fine</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">I love the Luke Fx lightsaber more
  than any other one because it is made nicely, it is light, and it
  has a good glow in the dark that makes it look real. I would not
  even dream of fighting with it, I would think it would break in a
  few days of fighting. There is not much to say except it is the
  best Fx next to the Darth Vader and it looks cool in the dark. It
  is so bright it lights up a whole room when the lights are
  off</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">I love this chimp and I am an adult.
  All the kids in the neighborhood come to play with it. It is so
  realistic</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">Excellent I love chimps and watch all
  documentaries,so I had to have this one for my birthday and I am
  thirty seven years old.I would buy from you again</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">Santa brought this for my 5 year old
  daughter for Christmas and she loves it. She takes it in the car
  with her with her baby doll and belts it in with the seat belt.
  One of the things I love about it is it isn't too heavy for her
  to carry. She can carry it with her baby doll in it without any
  trouble. It is also very sturdy. She has even sat in it herself
  and it didn't break. I would recommend this doll carrier. It is
  great for little people who enjoy pretending to be mommy and
  daddy</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">You know the family games that you
  regret buying, especially when you see your child coming at you
  with it on a rainy day, saying, "Will you play this with me?"
  Well, Rat-a-Tat-Cat is not one of these. It's simple enough to
  learn, but there is enough challenge in it to keep even an adult
  guessing. Rat-a-Tat-Cat was a gift to our family, but when my
  youngest daughter (age 4 or 5 at the time) got the hang of it, it
  became her favourite and here's why: 1)Though she was just
  learning numbers, she could understand the game, 2)The guessing
  part of the game put her on equal par with adults, to her
  delight. 3)Even for a busy adult, it's easy enough to sit down
  and play this game and actually can be relaxing. 4) If a guest
  came over, my daughter was able to explain the game rules to the
  guest and soon she'd have even teenage guys sitting cross-legged
  on the floor trying to get rid of the rats. Good ice-breaker.
  Simply put, rats are bad, cats are good. High points ~ you don't
  want them. The higher the number on the card, the more rat-power
  in the drawing. Zero is the best, with rats gone and a cat
  installed as a happy Statue of Liberty. The drawings are
  whimsical &amp;amp; clever. The reason it's a success as a game
  for all ages is because though it appears simple, there is the
  element of not knowing what your cards are and even if you peek
  (with permission), opponents can take your best away from you.
  So, if you don't mind losing to a kid and making that kid's day,
  as well as having a laugh, go ahead and get this game. My
  daughter is older now and we still play it. She's also learned to
  be a good loser :-</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">My son received this as a christmas
  gift and loves it. Took a little bit for him to understand how to
  work it. Only down fall is that it won't run on carpet. Requires
  hard floor or table to sit on. Goes really fast</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">I read about this RC racer in Family
  Fun magazine and it got best toy for 10-12 age group and they
  were Right! It is alot of fun to put together..not too hard, but
  a good challenge...It can also be made into a different model,we
  went online to lego and got the directions. It is also sturdy,
  maneuvers, speeds up to 13 miles in hours and can take all kinds
  of terrain including snow jumps. The battery has given us about
  an hour of hard driving.The remote is alot of fun to use. I loves
  it...its spendy, but I've already had hours of fun</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">My 2 year old loves it... though one
  set of grandparents can't stand the noise so if you don't like
  noisy toys - obviously this isn't one for you. Otherwise its
  great! Runs out of battery very quickly though.</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">i bought it for my grandson who is
  4,but my granddaughter liked it better then he did and she is
  only a year old,she kept hugging it and trying to dance with
  it</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">My 9 month old received this for
  Christmas and loves it! He is not quite crawling yet, he sort of
  scoots around and loves to grab and wrestle this toy. So far it
  has been very sturdy but yet soft enough for the baby to roll on
  and squeeze. The voice and phrases it says are so very cute too,
  we love the little giggle and when it says "Hello Baby"!! This is
  an adorable toy</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">My son turned 4 on Tuesday and I had
  bought this and was saving it as a birthday gift! He ABSOLUTELY
  LOVES IT! He has spent hours and hours of time already sitting
  and playing with this playset and his turtles. Even my husband
  thinks it's cool! It wasn't too difficult to put together and it
  stays together quite nicely! Great toy for a 4 year old that
  loves TNMT</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">i don't know but mine has stayed
  together for the whole year nothing broke i had to fix the couch
  a little but i forgot to snap in the little thing into the front.
  but nothing broke and i'm not rough on it and i pick it up by the
  handle nothing's wrong with it though</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">An inexpensive way to have fun, and
  they have brought smiles to every person who uses them</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">This was the best stocking stuffer
  ever. And we got 4. One for each of us. Mine is know at my
  office, and my boss loves it</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">We (my husband and I) brought this
  toy for our 2 year old last Christmas because then she was an
  Elmo fanatic. She still plays with this toy even though her
  intrests have shifted to Dora! At first I wasn't quite sure what
  this thing did except make noise but as I watched her play with
  it, I realized it taught her to follow directios. It's a mode
  where elmo asks you to follow the light and the keys light up one
  by one as you press them and I was truly amazed at my baby
  actually following the directions. This toy also teaches numbers.
  Overall, this toy is great for toddlers and tends to stay a
  favorite unlike those toys that end up at the bottom of the
  toybo</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">I just found this car at ToysRUs for
  $3.49; plus others in this series. I came online to Amazon to see
  if I could find characters not available at the store and I was
  blown away by these prices--$29.99???? You've got to be kidding
  me! I bought the TOY cars for my five year old son to PLAY
  with--the only reason I can see TOYS being priced this high is
  they must be trying to catch collectors. I'm glad I could find
  what I did at a local store; I definitely would not pay these
  high prices... I would have been very happy to buy others in the
  series from Amazon, but at these prices I am definitely NOT going
  to!</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">My daughter received this loom as a
  gift for her 6th birthday. Even though the box says for ages 7
  and up, and even though she's not the most nimble-fingered kid,
  she has no trouble using this loom with just a little help. The
  materials seem to be high quality and it comes with a good amount
  of thick, colorful yarn. The loom has been keeping my daughter
  happily occupied for long periods of time. She enjoys watching me
  knit, but doesn't have the dexterity yet to knit herself, so
  she's thrilled to be able to weave herself scarves and the

  <Text category="toys_games">When it first came out almost 20
  years ago, I saw this game at a bookstore and bought it to take
  on a Christmas skiing vacation with my family. Unfortunately, my
  mother ended up having emergency gallbladder surgery instead. We
  didn't have gifts that year, but we did made it to Colorado and
  spent hours by the fire laughing until our ribs ached playing
  this crazy game. It doesn't matter if you can draw, it's how fast
  you can put something down that halfway suggests the word they
  give you, and how ridiculous everyone's scribblings usually look.
  I've played it with an artist. He couldn't even draw a nose and
  chin in the 20 seconds he had, so his artistic standards took a
  dramatic tumble. If my spirits need a boost, I play this game.
  Buy it. You'll love it</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">This game was given to our 3 year old
  as a gift and he loves it. His little sister, who is two, also
  loves this game. This game really helps to develop a childs
  ability to concentrate on visual cues. It is basically a matching
  game combined with a puzzle concept. There are no complex rules
  to learn, so within minutes of opening the box any child can
  begin to play and enjoy this game. As each match is made the
  child receives immediate reward and motivation to find a new
  match. Best of all is that this is a simple game with no buzzers
  or bells and is best played with the TV turned off</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">This is the best game for the beach
  and the car. The little letters clip right into the board. It has
  a zipper case also. It's great and we enjoy it very much</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">For scrabble aficionados with

  <Text category="toys_games">We recently played BONKERS at our
  game club. As we read the instructions we were hoping going
  BONKERS would be fun and it was. BONKERS is a game based on
  asking players questions. The questions are not trivia and
  knowledge-based questions, but instead word-based questions. For
  instance, a question might ask you to "Come up with words that
  end in BELL". During your turn you have 30 seconds to "Go
  Bonkers" trying to blurt out answers like: BARBELL; DUMBBELL;
  DOORBELL, COWBELL etc. Your goal would be to find as many answers
  as possible in order to hit any or all of the four answers
  provided on the game card. For every answer you hit, you win
  scoring chips. That was just one category of questions called ADD
  ONS - where you find words that begin or end with a certain word.
  The other categories are: WHAT THE BLANK - where you find words
  to complete the blank; RHYME TIME - where you find as many rhymes
  as possible in order to match those provided on the game card;
  and LETTER PERFECT - where you would find words which begin or
  end with certain letters. The game play is interesting because
  there is some strategy thrown in. At the beginning of the round,
  one player (the Card Reader) peeks at the Question and Answers on
  Game Card and decides how many scoring chips each answer is
  worth. So, in the example above, the card reader might allocate 5
  scoring chips to the answer COWBELL, four chips to BARBELL, three
  chips to DUMBELL and two chips to DOORBELL. This is done by
  placing the chips on the gameboard under target answer "A"; "B",
  "C" or "D". The object is for the card reader to decide on which
  answers are hardest and place the most scoring chips on the
  hardest answer. This is because if the players do not hit some or
  any of the answers provided on the game card, the Card Reader
  will win the scoring chips leftover and advance on the Board.
  However, if the players hit all or any of the answers on the game
  card, they win the scoring chips for the correct answers
  provided. I really like the strategy part of the game, it adds a
  good deal of spice. BONKERS provided for an entertaining evening.
  We will play again!</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">I love this playpen!! Durable
  plastic, can be extended to larger size (or shortened if going
  someplace that is not as large). Only problem is that my baby
  loves to "wander." She is not thrilled when Mommy "cages" her up
  in order to protect her while I make dinner and cannot watch her
  as closely as necessary. Crib toys can be safely attached on the
  sides (did that with her Aquarium toy, which she loves and it
  soothes her). Occasionally plays with music buttons and phone but
  nothing else seems to interest her. I just put her other toys in
  for her to play with</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">I bought this mostly for the
  container. I had individual play-doh products, like the barber
  set that came in it's own box. I'm able to put ALL play-doh
  things into this container and everything is in one spot. No more
  boxes and sorting. I even still have space for more things like
  different colors and everything. My daughter loves the variety of
  the toys and I love the convenience. I'm going to buy it for
  presents for other families I know!</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">These dominos are great for the hello

  with plastic to hold the dominoes up in the window and make it
  look full. I would have rated it five stars if it had been
  full</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">We use this travel turtle on the
  airplane and in the car for my 1- and 2-year old children. It's
  intended for children a little older, and I can see why, as they
  are not able to easily balance the turtle on their laps. However,
  my 2-year-old can use it by herself, and it helped her to have a
  flat place to color and play with her magnetic board toys. I had
  to hold it in place for my 1-year-old, but when doing so, it also
  allowed him to color. I would recommend it, especially for
  children 3 and up.</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">I'm not one for guns in my household,
  but my potty-training son really wanted this blaster gun. He's a
  total Star Wars fan (like his father) and I told him that he
  could have it if he said good-bye to diapers. He did. So we
  ordered it and waited for the UPS man to come. He was so excited
  when it was delivered. He thought the UPS man was so cool for
  giving that to him! Anyways, there is so much detail on this
  blaster gun. The sounds are pretty cool and it lights up red. My
  son loves the sight scope too! Big hit in our household!!!</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">this is a great table/chairs set.. my

  easy to move around...easy to claen... reasonable price...i thnk
  i love it but i just wish that table size wa a little
  larger</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">I have read other reviews here that
  this table is too high for 2 and 3 year olds. Maybe so but, it is
  wonderful for 4-5 year olds! Those "in between stages" kids who
  want to have a small table of their own but, need something a bit
  taller and more sturdy than those made for toddlers. My son
  (almost 5) and his big sister (7) can both sit together and eat a
  snack at this table. It is very sturdy! The small drawer is great
  for crayons or stickers to be put out of the way at snack time.
  The surface of the table is just the right size for imaginative
  play with puzzles or action figures. The unique oval shape of the
  table takes up less room while still providing a good sized table
  top surface space. My son had outgrown 2 "child size" table and
  chair sets by age 4- most are actually buit for toddlers- this
  table is actually for "Kids" and it has been a big hit at our
  home. Guess who's getting the matching Lifestyle kitchen for
  Christmas</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">The only draw back of this toy as
  others have said is the arms are stiff and make it hard to hug..
  Other than that, this toy is simply adorable , the motorized
  sound of movements are hardly noticable.. and the sounds it makes
  are truly neat. My daughter got this over a year ago, (she is 7
  now) and she still loves this bear and we have not had any
  problems with any broken limbs.</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">The doll is wonderful and my
  granddaughter thinks it is her best birthday gift. I also want to
  especially compliment and thank Amazon for their excellent
  handling of this purchase. I made a mistake when ordering and
  they very promptly helped me to correct it. I look forward to
  doing business with Amazon in the future</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">Ever since my son was 10 months old
  he just HAD to check out the vacuum whenever it was out. So we
  decided to get him a toy vacuum for his birthday. Since we use a
  canister vacuum I wanted to get him a canister vacuum as well,
  and this was pretty much the only one out there. He just LOVES
  it, and since he is under 3, (the recommended age), I took the
  long gray pole out of the vacuum so its just his size. (the head
  fits fine straight onto the hose.) He knows how to turn it on
  &amp;amp; off, but mostly likes dragging it around. He also likes
  taking the two attachments out. And I love how this vacuum has no
  real suction because then it would not be safe for my little one.
  The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because he
  loves this toy so much that he wants to drag it EVERYWHERE. And
  that can be a pain- (to the car, in the highchair, on the
  changing table, etc.) so I've had to hide it sometimes. :) But I
  am very happy with this vacuum</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">My two daughters (two and four) got
  this for Christmas from "Santa", after seeing this, they no
  longer had any interest in any other gift. They love it and spend
  hours on in fixing each others hair</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">This was a great addition to our Read
  with Me dvd collection. My son loves it - there are so many games
  and options available that it keeps him occupied for
  hours!</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">I love this motorcycle and it is a
  "no-duh" that it doesn't run on fuel. Really...think...what fuel
  are you going to use. Plus, fuel is hazardous to children and a
  company wouldn't threaten the lives of innocent children! That's
  my OPINION</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">My 9 year old son loves Dragon
  Mountain. He wasn't able to assemble it alone; eventhough he's
  typically very good at assembling most other toys. It took about
  an hour for him and his dad to assemble it...but he felt it was
  more than worth the time it took to put it together</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">We are loving this set! Very cool
  dragons, a fun environment for characters to explore and fight
  in. Extra fun from several moving features - rasing/lowering
  cauldron, tramcar on sloped tracks, erupting mountain top,
  opening dragon mouth, flapping dragon wings, firing cannon. A
  little challenging to build, but the instructions are fairly
  clear. Assembly took an adult about 3 relaxed hours. A few
  sections come apart after some play but they are pretty easy to
  put back together. So far no pieces have broken. Most important,
  this is a lot of fun to play with. Over the past two days, our
  set has been getting non-stop play from a 9 year old boy and 6
  year old girl. A great toy for two kids to play with together,
  and the boy says a single child could also spend hours happily
  playing by himself. We wouldn't have paid the full retail price
  for this, but at $35 (Amazon discounted price), I think this is
  appropriate value.</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">This costume kit was a great deal for
  the price. My son loves it</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">Saw this on Jay Leno and it was a
  Hilarious Gift! Tried it out and it dances to the chicken dance
  song and when you grab its neck it yelpsand pretends to choke
  then when you let go it continues its dance. I Can't wait to give
  it as a Christmas Present.</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">These 'Cars' characters are all
  quality die-cast replicas that kids young and not so young can
  enjoy. The kids love playing with them and so far, our 'cast
  members' are still intact. But they do look so good you might
  want to put one on your desk... The details: painless shopping
  and quick shipping, as usual on Amazon</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">The Tonka truck was for my grandson
  for his birthday. His first Tonka Truck. He loved it. Couldn't
  even wait to get it out of the box. He turned one yrs. old and he
  started trying to sit on the top and he did and it held up. Good
  going Tonka</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">My daughters(4year old, 2year old and
  9 mos) love this toy. The keys are a little hard to hit but they
  seem to really enjoy it. The baby enjoys trying to play it but
  likes watching her sisters play it more</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">I first purchased the Winnie the Pooh
  Soft 'n Silly Tigger for my son when he was 4 months old. He is
  now 14 months and LOVES his Tigger. We now have 2 Tiggers, one as
  a back up, and he carries them everywhere he goes. It's a great
  toy for young children to sleep with, being soft and cuddly.
  Tigger has been a great comfort for my son and I don't know what
  I would have done with out them!</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">My 3 year old received this puzzle as
  a gift for his 3rd yr birthday. I wasn't so sure if he was ready
  for the puzzle at the age of 3, but four months after his
  birthday together with his cousins he started putting the pieces
  together. He is now 3.5 yrs. and knows how to complete it all by
  himself within less than 10min. I give ten stars</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">This is a great toy that lets
  childrens' minds grow. Both ,my 7 and 5 year old love to play
  with this toy. The magnetic base is so strong that you can build
  the metal peices ontop of each other to make a big sculpture. I
  would highly recommend this</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">Previous reviews listed the lack of
  volume control as a negative point. In a panic I ran to check the
  three I have purchased for Christmas gifts 2002. ALL three have
  volume controls now! Don't let reviews on a previous model keep
  you from purchasing these products. Friends have these and my
  girls begged for their own. As a home-schooling mom I prefer to
  buy toys that are both fun and educational - Leap Frog is my best
  source</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">The game of memory is a great
  equalizer because little children are just as apt to remember
  where they saw the hidden images as older children or adults.
  This makes it great game for the whole family to play together.
  The images from the &amp;amp;quot;I Spy&amp;amp;quot; book
  illustrations are bright and creative. They don't match exactly-
  for instance, there might be two images of cats, but borrowed
  from different photographs in the I Spy books. So there is a bit
  more visual variety to spice things up. This is a much more
  attractive memory game than most, and would make an ideal gift
  for a child or family</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">I just purchased this redesigned
  AT-ST from a local retail store. For the basic price of $20 for
  244 pieces, this set is well worth the price. I purchased the
  original AT-ST years ago and this model far surpasses that one in
  all ways. It's larger, much more stable, and has a unique
  pivoting mechanism which rotates the cab. It was very difficult
  to get the original AT-ST to stand upright without falling over;
  the 7657 is extremely stable. The original AT-ST had Chewbacca at
  the controls which was pretty cool. However, not as cool as the
  AT-ST driver that has a new helmet and blaster. The only drawback
  is that his minifig head is flesh colored instead of traditional
  LEGO yellow. It took about 20 minutes to put the model together.
  It wasn't very challenging but interesting to see how the
  rotating mechanism was put together. I would highly recommend
  purchasing this set. For the low price of $20 for such a detailed
  and complete set, it's well worth the price. You won't be
  disappointed</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">I bought this toy because Amamzon's
  price was a great bargin compared to other stores. I would have
  given this product 5 stars but gave it only 4 because the can is
  so large and the lincoln logs only fill is maybe half way. There
  is a lot more room for more logs. 115 sounds like a lot but you
  are only able to make the one cabin seen on the front. I ended up
  buying additional logs (not lincoln logs) so that me and the kids
  could build additional buildings and a fence</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">I was very happy with the Lincoln
  Logs I ordered for my three year old grandson. He has been
  enjoying them. They seem to be more complicated than they were
  when my son was his age which was about 35 years ago or close to
  it. Then it was only one small log cabin but this set is a
  western building. My grandson has still been able to build
  something that he likes. Thank you for making it available</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">I recently bought this Read With Me
  DVD System after much hesitation from other reviews. It was on
  sale at Toy r' Us for $18 so I decided that I would go ahead and
  try it. I took the advice of one of the reviewers and waited
  until my daughter went to bed to program it. To be honest, it
  took me longer to get it out of the package than to program it.
  The system was programmed in less than 5 minutes and I have a
  Pioneer DVD player that is over 5 years old. The only thing I
  would suggest besides waiting until you child is asleep is not to
  lay the DVD control perfectly flat or it will be lower than the
  eye on the Read with Me DVD system. My daughter absolutely loved
  it! The reason I gave it 4 out of 5 is because wish they had a
  few more DVD available in stores.</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">Ok so my son got it for christmas and
  here it is june and i just hooked it up. it took me all of 5
  mintutes not even that to program it. the first try #4 wouldnt
  take so what i did is i put the toy remote on one thigh and the
  remote on the other so that there were almost touching and so
  that the "eyes" were right on top of each other. and it took
  straight away. Its really fun for my 4 year old my 10 year old
  got bored. my only suggestion is that there needs to be a bigger
  choice of games. they are so similar that my 4 year old changes
  games quite a bit. i am actually having trouble finding games for
  it now. its great and if they are going to be in front of the TV
  might as well be learning. he also hase VSMILE which is a little
  bit better if you can afford the 60$ for the game unit and 20$
  for the games. (grandma and grandpa got ours for us with games)
  so it wasnt bad for us. read with me DVD is good though, i really
  enjoy playing it and listening to the stories</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">My children are 7, 5 and 20 months,
  and they all love it. The baby is especially fascinated by it and
  was able to make the top spin by herself after her brothers
  coached her a bit. The humming sound is much less annoying the
  many of their battery operated toys with voices and electronic
  noises</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">my 19 month old loves the toy for its
  colors, I like it because it allows me to get more chores
  finished in the kitchen! It has a nice suction base to keep the
  top steady on tile. It was a little difficult at first, for my
  son to handle, since a good bit of strength is needed to push the
  bar down especially if you want to hear it hum and spin fast. The
  colors are pretty cool, The faster it spins the more colors come
  out (primary + yellow/orange colors). I like that it holds his
  interest. A [...] could defentley get this down better but at
  least there is room to grow!</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">This is a perfect game that you can
  enjoy with the whole family! It is very fun and great for little
  ones too! I own this game, and my family enjoys it very much.
  This is a great mystery game where you spy to find out each
  pearson's idenity. I love this game and I think you would
  too</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">If you love the unpredictable, then
  Catch 22 is for you. This game has plenty of social interaction
  and combines skill with luck in the pursuit of 22 gold tokens.
  Just when I thought I was about to win the game, my boyfriend
  landed on my game piece and stole all of my tokens. Boy, that did
  not make me happy at all. The key to this game is to use your
  blocker cubes wisely. The cubes are used to either block an
  opponents way or safeguard your path to the money. Once you use
  the cubes, you can only retrieve them by landing on a 'collect
  blocker' square. You can collect any blocker cube placed on the
  board, including your opponent's cubes. I made lots of money
  selling blocker cubes back to my opponents. We were so addicted
  to this game that we played it all night long. I highly recommend
  it, but be prepared to either win big or lose your shirt!</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">I especially like this product for
  traveling and sitting in waiting rooms. My only complaint is that
  you have to hold it just right to see the puzzle clearly on the
  screen. It has a contrast adjustment, but it not very helpful. It
  also has a lighted screen option which is not very good either. A
  great improvement would be a screen with greater contrast.</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">I purchased this item for my 4 years
  old neice. She is Dora crazy as my 6 year old was at 2 and 3
  years old. My daughter has the older version and she still plays
  with it. It's her house for her and her dolls. My neice is also
  enjoying her Dora house. Great gift. It does not take up too much
  space. You can slide it under a bed, behind a couch etc. Dora
  house is great!</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">This set of crayons is very durable
  &amp;amp; colorful! It comes in a cute organized pouch which has
  4 zippered compartments that fold togehter and velcro shut. The
  crayons are EXCELLENT quality, comparable to Crayola. Young kids
  and adults will enjoy hours of fun with crayons. Create things to
  your hearts desire. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED PRODUCT and Great for
  Travel Too!</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">7yr old son has had many many hours
  of fun rebuilding this into many different tracked and wheeled
  vehicles. Quickly lost interest in snow monster part but the
  vehicle part is easily changed around for new setup each time.
  Highly recommended</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">My 4 year old son got some early
  christmas money from his grandparents. So we went and bought this
  toy at Target (and paid 30.09 for it) He loves it... his favorite
  part was that you can take the whole thing apart and put it
  together different each time. My only concern was that the snow
  monster needs camera batteries or cell phone batteries??? What
  are those??</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">Many people are not time oriented. I
  have used this both in the classroom and at home. It allows the
  children a visual clue to how much time has gone past. I tell
  them they have 30 minutes to complete something. I set green for
  20, yellow for 7, and red for 3. I don't have to say anything
  else. This eliminates waiting time once they realize that at red
  they need to be picking up and getting ready for the next
  lesson</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">My three year old takes a "rest"
  instead of a nap, which means he stays in his room for a quiet
  time so mommy has some sanity. He can't tell time, so he would
  come out every 5 minutes to see if rest time was over. In order
  to keep him in there for an hour I purchased this clock so he can
  see and hear when his time was up. It works perfectly and he
  isn't anxious about when his time is up. He understood the
  concept of the clock changing from green to yellow to red quickly
  and knows when the clock is red that his time is almost up. I set
  the clock to announce when his time is up and then he comes on
  out. No more "is it time yet?". I get my full hour of sanity
  uninterupted!</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">We wanted this little doll for our
  own "Little Ariel". She is perfect for the bath tub! She comes
  with her own float, wand with bath tints, and swim coverup!! Her
  bright red hair is put in little pig tails with bows and she has
  a baby powder fresh scent (which we were not expecting- my
  husband is not to found of that). We are very pleased and hope
  that this company continues to make baby princess items!!!</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">Our son is 2 y.o. and had a great
  time with this puzzle. Enjoy all the animals</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">This game is great to get to know
  your friends and family in a new light. It encourages deep
  converasations but can also be a fun and energetic game. You'll
  find yourselves wrapped up in topics that you'd never discuss
  otherwise.</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">Great game for all ages. Lots of fun
  if played with many people. Very intertaining</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">I love it! it's really light weight
  and portble. The batteries do go dead without the charger and the
  PVDs should have more then 30 minutes-60minutes. I like this
  video now alot. Calling it a toy is a little far fetched but it's
  wonderful. I hope you buy it!</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">This item showed up on time and
  without incident... I'm not sure what else I can expect from a
  pair of novelty glasses.</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">We all LOVE this toy. What I like
  about it, is that it's easy to use, even for my almost three yr
  old, it has realistic sounds yet not obnoxious, it's sturdy,
  (Will only tip when it knocks into something pretty hard) it
  LOOKS good, not cheap, and it's pretty wallet friendly as far as
  price goes. This has been THE big hit this Christmas. Even more
  so than Tekno Puppy</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">My 11 yr old son got these Moon Shoes
  at Christmas and he plays with them a lot. He has ADHD and
  Sensory Integrative Dysfunction, and the bouncing really soothes
  him and gets him refocused. I don't think he ever expected to
  bounce very high; he seems to be happy enough with the bounce he
  gets. When he wants to play with them in the house, I send him
  downstairs to jump around on the concrete floor to save wear and
  tear on my hardwoods. The downside for us has been that the bands
  have started snapping very frequently. At the rate he's going,
  he'll run out of bands long before he outgrows wanting to play
  with the toy. So if anyone hears of a way to get more bands,
  please speak up</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">My 8-year old wanted a pirate ship
  for Christmas, which was a dilemma because all I could find were
  ships for toddlers or LEGO-related ships. This one is fully
  assembled (PHEW!) and when he opened the box, he jumped for joy.
  The 4 action figures have the sinister look an 8-yr old could
  appreciate. The cannon really shoots and the hoist loads and
  unloads treasures. My son found enough small removable parts on
  the ship (a parrot, tools, anchor, lamps) to keep him occupied
  for hours. The whole ship is hard or molded plastic, including
  the sails. I'm fairly confident it will hold up in many future
  battles. I'm VERY happy with this ship, but I wouldn't recommend
  it to a toddler or a child who looses small objects</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">My son wanted this piece and we have
  enough of the other pieces to incorpate it into the track system
  we have started and my son loves it and plays with it so I have
  to say it has exceeded my expectation for the value it added to
  our GEO Trax railroad</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">This review is not about the toy, but
  about the service you can expect to receive from Amazon.com. If
  you are buying this as a gift, only do so if you have months to
  wait, even if the item is listed as available. Amazon.com will
  allow you to pay your money under the guise of sending your
  items, and then days later, inform you of a delay in shipping,
  and then a week later inform you the item has just shipped and
  can take up to an additional 10 days for delivery. Despite the
  site's claims that the item would ship in 24hrs and be delivered
  in 3-5 days. Mind you, they're sending it via UPS or American
  Home.... Honestly, there are other retailers out there who are
  more reliable than Amazon.com and I strongly recommend using them
  - unless you're okay disappointing the little girl in your life.
  I know I hate having to tell my neice that the gift I promised
  her still won't be there - even though her birthday has passed,
  by almost a week at this poin</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">My daughter is 2 1/2 years old and I
  often find myself surrounded by some loud toys that jingle or
  sing. After dinner I find that this book is a wonderful
  transition into our bedtime routine. She has learned how to
  button, use a zipper and problem solve by using this book. Also,
  I find that this is a great toy to keep in the car when rush hour
  traffic becomes horrible. I have bought this book for many of my
  friends children and would recommend this to anyone who has a
  toddler since the it holds up extremelly well no matter how hard
  your child plays with it</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">Our whole family loves this game. I
  like this version because it includes the history and rules of
  the game on the inside cover. I also like that you can close the
  cover and not lose the dice. The construction is a little flimsy
  and there is not enough felt on the board which makes the dice
  rolling a little noisy. We added a piece of felt on top of the
  board and it is much better</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">These days, classic game shows aren't
  really as popular as reality shows like Survivor and American
  Idol. However, with the surprise Summer show, Game Show Marathon
  in CBS, many clssics had the opportunity to breathe a glimpse of
  new life, like Press Your Luck, Match Game, and Card Sharks.
  Another classic which was revised, Let's Make A Deal. With Monty
  Hall's benchmark into pop culture revisted, many have wondered
  whether the classic game of trading will ever come back onto
  television again. Thankfully, those who easily own DVD actually
  don't have to wait for the show to return. They can just trade in
  the comforts of their own living room. The Let's Make A Deal DVD
  game, recaptures the classic trading that Monty Hall made popular
  from the 70's and 80's into a great fun game. In this game, Monty
  Hall puts traders to the test where you can trade your chances
  for big nostalgic prizes like classic cars from Datsun, and
  Cadillac, to trips and fur coats from Dicker &amp;amp; Dicker of
  Beverly Hills. On top of that, there are classic quick deals to
  play for extra cash. For example, if you have a pair of scissors,
  Monty will give you $700. Also, there are the classic booby
  prizes, Zonks!!! Although they are fun to receive, you get
  absolutely nothing to show for it. There is also the anticipation
  of getting the Big Deal for big bucks. Unlike DVD editions of
  shows like Family Feud and The Price Is Right, the game really
  delivers a great job from Monty, and each of the great concepts
  from the classic game show. The mastering really thrives with
  classic clips of Carol Merill and Deal's announcer Jay Stewart on
  each of the prizes. Although I just wish there could've been more
  games to play, I am absolutely impressed with the way Let's Make
  A Deal was put into a DVD game. If you haven't seen this classic
  game show, Monty Hall hosted, you have to buy this great game. I
  absolutely recommend this, and that is definitely not a zonk!

  <Text category="toys_games">We gave our nine yr. old grandson
  this train for Christmas. He had a such a good time putting it
  together, then running it on the track. The train absolutely
  glides on the track, so quietly and smoothly. It is a great
  product</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">I bought my seven and ten year old
  daughters moon shoes for christmas. I had read all the reviews,
  so I immediately instructed the girls to always wear their
  bicycle helmets when playing with their moon shoes. Yes, they can
  be dangerous, but with a few precautions, I think the kids will
  have more fun, be safer, and the parents will have peace of mind.
  1. Don't let the kids start jumping right away, hold their hand
  or have them put their hand on your shoulder as they practice
  walking in them. 2. Once they've achieved the ability to balance,
  have them practice bouncing in place just a little bit. This will
  help them learn to balance as they move and learn how the moon
  shoes respond to the way they move. 3. Set ground rules, no
  bouncing when there is a lot of debris around, no bouncing while
  holding objects, always wear helmet, no bouncing near each other,
  and if you feel or hear any of the rubber bands break while
  bouncing sit down immediately and take off the shoes. My kids
  spent the first half hour/45 minutes getting use to their moon
  shoes. They now can bounce around with stability and
  confidence</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">Great little wagon!! The canopy is

  <Text category="toys_games">The gizmo doll is very realistic. It
  looks just like the one in the movie. The doll's ears are about
  11 inches across and the doll is about 8 inches tall. I bet your

  like a member of the family. Thank you for reading</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">This is great! No more lost
  cartridges or torn books. Very easy for my four year old to store
  all her leap pad items</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">both of my kids have a LeapPad and
  several books ... this is a great way to keep them all together.
  It's durable and kid friendly--so they can keep track of their
  cartridges and books ... and it's great b/c they can just grab it
  and go which makes it nice for travel too</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">We bought the LeapPad Plus for our 4
  year old for Christmas and 4 books to go along with it. Then I
  realized we had no where to put it, we also bought the
  Littletouch leadpad for our 1 year old and a bunch of books.
  Yesterday we went and bought this and the carry case for our
  little one's littletouch. Great space saver. It is made very well
  too. Our daughter calls it her briefcase. It fits everything
  perfectly</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">This movie teaches the basic ballet
  steps with the use of a mat. Although it is a little slow in the
  beginning, once the dancing starts my daughter is hooked. We
  started with with a VHS and had to buy a dvd because we played
  the video so much.</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">My grandparents bought me this for
  Christmas and I really love it! The doll is absolutely
  breathtaking, and she has honey blond hair with golden
  highlights. Her eyes are a deep blue green color, and she is very
  pretty overall. The closet she comes with is very cute, and I can
  put Barbie shirts and skirts on the little hangers! There is a
  lot of room for shoes and purses and hair accessories, I love
  this toy</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">I was really excited when I saw this
  Doll, because I'm Navajo. It's something I can let my daughters
  take into school to share during native American Month. We all
  like it a lot</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">This was a hit for both of our kids.
  They had so much fun making their very own unique soccer ball. We
  have already used it for our indoor soccer league and it was a
  hit!! For all you soccer moms and dads, this is a wonderful gift
  for your child.</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">I thought this would be a great gift
  for my child since she is an avid soccer player and very
  creative. The markers provided were not any different than ones
  that we use for crafts. I hope that her design will stay on the
  ball after playing with it</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">GREAT!!! It is the Perfect place to
  store all those wooden puzzles we all have for our toddlers! The
  puzzles slide right in on the small metal rods...Very easy to
  remove puzzles! I also like the fact that is made of a lovely
  natural wood! We have this in our living room, and it is quite
  attractive</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">My son got this game as a gift. I
  brought it into my junior high classroom to use on a game day.
  The kids love this game and request it over and over. Many other
  teachers have asked to borrow it for their classes. It is a great
  vocabulary builder. I also made my own cards with letters of the
  alphabet on them. I use these when we are studying parts of
  speech -- they have to come up with a noun (adjective, verb, etc)
  that begins with that letter. This is a great game and a good way
  to make a rather dull subject more interesting</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">My 3 3/4 yr old got these for
  Christmas and he loves them. Plays with them almost every day. We
  bought both dinosaur kits and they are fun to combine together.
  My son loves to not only put together the "proper" dinosaurs, but
  make up his own creatures as well. A fun way for dinosaur loving
  kids to engage in some creative "think outside the box"
  play</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">WE PLAYED THIS GAME WITH 3 COUPLES
  AND ALL OF US ENJOYED IN VERY MUCH WE LAUGHED THE WHOLE TIME IT
  WAS A VERY ENJOYED GAME FOR ALL</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">The little mermaid pop-up castle was
  sold out everywhere this past holiday season selling at $34.99. I
  found it on Amazon for $26.47 and free shipping! My daugher, 3
  yrs old, just loves it. The accessories are very tiny, like the
  tea pot and tea cups. Tiny like your pinky fingernail. We all
  love it! Easy to put together, but I think it folds up, I don't
  know how though</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">Pefect addition to any little mermaid
  collection. Very durable plastic, not too many little pieces.
  Clothes for dolls could be easier to take on/off</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">Apparently she has loaded this
  stroller down with dolls, purses etc and has not let it out of
  her sight since it was delivered (on time incidentially!)</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">We bought this pool toy for our
  daughter, and she was thrilled!!! But after being on this toy one
  time we now call him the bucking bull. Good luck staying on the
  silly thing. Now my child sits and hangs on to the handles and we
  pull her around the pool on it. My husband and I cannot stay on
  this thing either. Every now and then we bail on with sheer
  determination, only to be off in a matter of seconds</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">I have been having such a good time
  with this marshmellow shooter! I recommend it to anyone. Plus you
  can aim at someone and they can eat what the ammo! Thinking of
  giving these to me employees as Christmas gifts!</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">This item is sooooo cute! Garfield is
  dressed in his jammies and is clutching Pookie in his left arm.
  We highly recommend TY Goodnight Garfield, especially if you are
  a Garfield fan</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">The remote on this car has nice big
  buttons that are easy for my two year old to use. One button
  makes the car go forward and one turns it around. The third just
  makes reving engine &amp;amp; squealing tire sounds. Not very
  realistic but convincing enough for a toddler. This car has been
  tossed around and dropped yet still looks and works great. It is
  a very durable toy that is simple to use. It is a great first
  remote control car.</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">This doll is absolutely breathtaking.
  I bought her for my "gift closet", but I think I'll keep her for
  myself! The price was only $5.29 during the special Toys R Us
  sale, plus free shipping. Couldn't ask for a better deal or a
  prettier collectible doll</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">Excellent! My 2 yrs. old grandson is
  loving it. I purchased a storage case for his Melissa &amp;amp;
  Doug puzzles, and it helps keep them organized and neat. Much
  appreciated by Mom &amp;amp; Dad</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">We learned about these blocks years
  ago when my now 13 year old was in pre-school. I was amazed at
  how these seemingly simple pieces of wood, so totally enraptured
  these little kids! Kapla, are 'blocks' that are all exactly the
  same size. At first glance, they seem boring. But once you start
  playing with them, they are so much more. They can be made into
  all kinds of structures, and can even be raised higher than one
  can reach, without falling!! When our 'surprise blessing' turned
  2, I pulled them out for him. He enjoyed them (though at 3 he
  likes them much more), but what surprised me is that my older two
  (15 and 13) love playing with them as well!! In fact, we ALL do!!
  I know it seems like a lot of money to spend on these, but they
  are MORE than worth it!</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">My daughter thinks these are the most
  adorable Fairies. They adorn every possible accessory she and her
  friends can attach them to. You never know who will have which
  charms as they are always swapping them. I would say that you get
  an amazing bang for your buck with these. They are the "in" thing
  right now with her 4th grade friends</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">This thing is great. Anything you can
  put on top of it to hold it down will stage it up to go off. It
  will blow up and not hurt anyone but scare them...funny funny
  funny!!!! You can use fairly light objects, you can use trip
  cords, and you can use trip cord like devices too, and probably
  much more that I have never thought of... Good luck, good fun,
  and good hunting! Sam Kochel... p.s. hope this was a helpful
  review</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">I bought this for my grandson for
  Christmas, he was 8 months old. This has been the best learning
  toy for him, along with entertainment. He has learned how the
  shapes work and took this on soon. It has also helped him in
  walking. It is entertaining for me to watch him play with this
  toy, he has to push the button and play the music before he
  pushes it. I would actually buy one more for him to have at home
  with Mom and Dad. This is well worth the money</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">AWESOME music and interaction... fun
  storage compartment under seat and blocks that fit into the sides
  and play wonderful songs. Gets the kiddo very involved.
  Transitions well from indoor toy to riding outside</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">We love this game. It seems to be the
  most fun with 5 or 6 people, although my husband and I also
  enjoyed the 2-person version. We do not usually use the board. We
  just use a scorepad to keep track of points. Once you catch on to
  the game, it's not too hard to come up with answers. Highly
  recommended</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">Legos, Duplos, Ello.. they don't hold
  a candle to the Kid Knex in the series. Unbelieveable how much
  our 6 year old daughter plays with these and our 3 YO son too.
  These have a good feel for kids too. Bright. Easy to use. We have
  all in set now. BRING ON SOME MORE</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">I received this for my 3 yr old
  daughter and she absolutely loves it. The price is great right
  now, especially with free shipping. She loves to dress the doll
  and use all the accessories. More than worth the low price...I'm
  going to stock up on a few more for misc. gifts. The package is
  large and comes with a lot of accessories</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">My son is a very active 2 yr old and
  very hard on toys, and these are great. Thick plastic
  construction. Easy enough for him to hook them up himself. We
  have 2 different kinds and they are both super</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">Unavailable for some time, the Sky
  High Suspension Bridge is back. Once you have the ramps to get
  the track up there, it really stands out as a part of the
  railroad. Assembly was required but routine; the directions were
  quite adequate. There are no stickers to wiggle into place</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">My niece couldn't put this down after
  she opened it. She had lots of fun doing tricks for her relatives
  at Christmas. The components of the set are very good quality. I
  patted myself on the back for discovering this "winner"
  gift</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">I've had this high chair for a year
  now, and I love it. My daughter plays with it every day, and it's
  worn great. It still looks as good as the day we put it together.
  I love that it's wood, rather than cheap plastic, and it's a
  pretty white with pink gingham, which I think is adorable. The
  material has held up great and still looks perfect. The wood is
  sturdy, with no cracks. It fits all my daughter's dolls,
  including her large Cabbage Patch doll. If I were going to change
  anything, I'd like a little bar in the front of the seat that
  would prevent the babies from slipping through (like real high
  chairs). For the most part, her babies stay put, but sometimes
  they slip down and out. It's not a big problem, though. Our
  friends bought the same one a year ago for their daughter, and
  feel the same way about it. We love the Badger Basket product
  line! I highly recommend this product</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">Another nice product from PlayDough.
  Worth the ten bucks or so.. We just bought this from Amazon. This
  would make a cute birthday present for a young child, say 2 to 8?
  Hard to give an age as I myself like to sit with my son and play!
  Enough play dough for the price and the bucket is really handy
  for storage. I would buy this again as a gift</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">I bought my Harvey toy a while ago,
  and I was quite pleased. It's actually very durable, like
  everyone else has said. The crane doesn't break off, no matter
  how often you play with it or how hard you may accidentaly step
  on it. I think the only way to break it off is via steam roller.
  Anyway, highly recommended for any Thomas collector</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">This is an attractive toy for infants
  and toddlers. The music and lights are nice.</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">This is the best of the LeapPad books
  I have seen. My four-year old has spent hours on it. It's very
  interactive and covers a lot of ground for that age. Highly
  recommended</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">Fun for kids age 4 -40. Bought it as
  a gag for my college age son... he loved it for pranks, but also
  let young nieces and nephews play with it. Kept them laughing for
  a long time.</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">Being the first Ravensburger puzzle I
  have ever owned, it is without a doubt the best quality and the
  best detailed puzzle I have ever worked with. The quality of the
  product is shown throughout, from the sturdy container,
  practically sediment free packaging, the exact cuttings of the
  each puzzle piece (not a single one was still attached to another
  puzzle piece and there were only one or two frayed cut spots in
  the whole set), and the high quality graphic printing. The puzzle
  itself is made difficult primarily by the use of similar colors
  throughout. The puzzle pieces are otherwise the standard cut
  type. The resulting artwork is something that we've decided to
  actually frame and hang in my office, which we have never done
  over the years (puzzles can be very calming to work on after a
  long week of long and stressful work hours - especially when
  working on them with others). The puzzle cuts are so well done
  that it is not entirely easy for someone to tell that it is a
  puzzle from general glancing unless they get up close (within 2
  feet) and look at the detail. I will definitely buy more
  Ravensburger puzzles and hope that they come out with even more
  puzzles of this type (old world maps) and same quality</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">An excellent project for your child's
  school report. We purchased the Velociraptor kit for our 8 year
  old daughter not knowing what to expect. After opening the
  package my wife came up with the clever idea of pouring melted
  chocolate chips into the dinosaur molds, instead of using the
  plaster mix that comes with the kit. We experimented with white
  chocolate chips and created realistic looking dinosaur bones! We
  buried these edible bones in ground up Oreo Cookies. What a
  thrill to see our daughter's 2nd grade class excavate these
  delectible prehistoric fossils! We can't wait to purchase other
  kits in the Eyewitness series</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">When the Toa and all the first
  Bionicles came out, it was very simple and straigthforward. Bad
  guys were different from the Toa and everyone knew they were bad.
  Now, with the Pirahka, we have villians claiming to be Toa! And
  the matoran believe them! One of the things I really love about
  Zaktan is his weapon. It looks really cool and can change. Also,
  the little ball launcher (I forget what it's called) is a lot of
  fun (I shot my brother with it X3) and the glowing eyes are just
  plain awesome! Though the rubber part is sligthy annoying, it
  doesn't really get in the way</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">As a brilliant, but ruthless leader
  of the Piraka, Zaktan thinks that working together is the way to
  find the ultimate treasure, the mask of life! All the Piraka have
  two tools. Yes, 2. Each one has a Zamor spheres which are small
  marbles that each one can shoot, but in real life they would be
  the size of basketballs. Zaktan's three-pronged blade is capable
  of cutting through metal. Nothing will get in his way, or it will
  be severely punished................</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">I bought the Little Tikes Adjust and
  Jam Basketball Set for my grandson's 4th birthday. It is perfect
  for his age group. The height can be raised or lowered and comes
  with 2 small size basketballs. He loves it</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">I think this toy is just too cute. It
  is a bit pricey though. I would not suggest you purchase this toy
  for a young toddler...maybe a 2 1/2 to 3 year old. My daughter
  likes throwing it on the ground and screaming with delight (she
  is one and a half). She really likes it and carries it around the
  house. She is a little too young to respect it properly and I
  fear it may not last long. It is really cute if you have real
  stainless steal appliances in your home. I bought this because my
  daughter has taken a keen interest in my microwave and I have
  trouble keeping her away from it. This toy has solved that
  problem. One minus is that it came with no instructions on how to
  get the table to rotate. You have to play with the buttons a
  little and then you will see how it operates. My daughter can not
  systematically make the turn table rotate...for her it happens
  randomly. She enjoys opening the doors, pushing the buttons,
  seeing the light come on and hiding her real dinner in there (so
  parents beware!). Someone suggested it is a tiny unit...and so it
  is, but all the other toy microwaves I looked at were very
  similar in size</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">I bought this doll w/ brunette hair
  for my 4 year old. It's so soft and realistic looking, floppy
  like a real newborn, perfect weight for little ones to cradle.
  I'd been looking for a 'baby' doll w/ long hair - some of the
  other co's make them too heavy, not conducive for real play. This
  doll is also washable, a big plus. The hair is soft and very
  brushable, the face is sweet and the eyes open and close
  properly. A little pricier than your average doll but you can see
  the difference in the skin texture and facial features. Overall a
  very nice doll, high quality, hopefully will be played w/ for
  many years.</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">This toy is FANTASTIC. Although I
  have the English speaking toy, it still has a similar sounding
  Italian accent to the toy. If you enjoyed the films, I highly
  recommend these toys!!! Is it possible to buy an Italian speaking
  Luigi</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">I bought this Item for my husband for
  xmas and he loved it but once they were all put together they
  would fall apart fairly easy but other then that they are great I
  highly recomend this especialy for a husband or son</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">I bought this for a present for my 2
  yr old daughter and she likes it and can turn the handle</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">My 3 yr old grandson loves this. He

  the product. Also with the purchase process</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">My son loves this instrument, but I
  think he likes another saxophone that plays tunes when you press
  buttons better. This one relies on the child to blow and press
  the keys, like a real instrument, but doesn't sound like a
  saxophone</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">we saw this online and really wanted
  it, but decided to wait because of the reviews. well today we
  went to an outlet store that sells new stuff at huge discount
  prices, and it was only 10.00 my son has already ridden the heck
  out of it with no problems, and he loves it. we havent had to
  replace a fuse and it just the right size for my 1 and a half
  year old. its a really great little bike, but for the workmanship
  of it, i definitly wouldnt pay 50 dollars for it, maybe 30-35
  most. we just got blessed with a really great deal:) so if ya
  want this for your kids, its great for the smaller rider, and
  just the right speed for him to control. hope this helps

  <Text category="toys_games">My family of seven kids, four
  daughters/sons-in-law have owned this game for 2 years. We love
  playing it and it is one of the few games that everyone enjoys.
  It is one of our favorite games and that is saying a lot since we
  own dozens of games. Our youngest was 12 when we bought the game
  and she often wins</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">I've been thrilled with the car so
  far. Super fast, and super cheap at this price. It could be a
  little more responsive when turning, but otherwise great. Lasted
  about 25mins with long fast runs using a generic 9.6v pack by
  newbright. As other person said, works better on packed surfaces
  vs loose dirt and grass. I bought it to bring back memories of my
  old Tyco turbo hopper from childhood...and it did a great job at
  that.</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">My son likes this item. The cars also
  fit his train set from imaginarium. The only thing I didn't like
  about putting this together was the elevator. Very tight fit and
  doesn't like to go up or down easily. But everyone likes playing
  with it, from the 18 mo old to the 10 year olds</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">We purchased a starter piece set for
  my girl when she was 3 years old. She absolutely loved it because
  it was easy to use and build. She had a hard time with the legos
  type blocks because it was more frustrating for her to pull them
  apart. We then expanded to this 35 piece and she is able to be
  even more creative. It is an excellent lerning toy. not as simple
  as it seems</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">This doll rocks! I love her hair,
  it's a dark reddish color and it's curled into seperate locks.
  And her dress is gorgeous! It's a powder pink color with long
  sleeves, and at the hands it has a big ball of white feathers.
  The necklece she has is very pretty, and so is her crown. Shes
  quite durable, and would make a great addition to any collection
  or toy chest</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">My daughter is one and a half, and
  she's had these blocks for about a year now, but only now is she
  really playing with them and identifying the little pictures.
  Some pictures are a little obscure, but all the basic animals and
  objects seem to be covered. I'm very pleased with how smooth the
  blocks are, and how well they are holding up. I feel they will
  really help my daughter to learn her letters, both in upper and
  lower case. My only problem is with the tray. It only holds the
  blocks if you keep it completely flat (as if a toddler can
  transport anything while keeping it level). I also don't like its
  sharp edges. My daughter went through a phase where she liked
  dumping the blocks out and then waving the tray around. Now the
  tray is stored out of reach and the blocks are stored in a small
  plastic bin</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">My 6 year-old daughter got this for
  Christmas and spent more than an hour coloring the pieces. The
  ink dries quickly and seems to stick pretty well. We have rinsed
  the tea set a couple of times and never noticed ink washing
  away.</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">The wooden corral is so simple it
  encourages hours of imaginative play. It is just the right size
  for my child's horses to play in and can be easily set up
  anywhere. Yet it is very compact when folded for storage.</Text>

  playing with this mustard-yellow engine on his wooden tracks.
  Very sturdy construction, and a great addition to the Thomas

  <Text category="toys_games">This action figure is sitting on my
  desk at home. He's my little computer buddy. It's really not bad
  at all, although the plastic hair doesn't allow his head to move
  very much. When I'm writing, and I get to a point where I need to
  back off a bit, I pick him up and change the pose, or threaten my
  daughter with the masamune, or she and I set him up for a couple
  of humourous pics. It's great. All hail Sephi!! (and you can just
  hear it, Why the heck are you calling me that? Well, why not?

  <Text category="toys_games">This is a great puppet theater, sound

  received this from Santa. He only wished he had found it sooner!
  My daughter continues to love it, and will now be sharing it with
  her younger sister. Many hours of pretend have been spent inside
  and outside this theater. We especially love it because it is
  large enough inside for two or more children. All the others we
  researched were too small for our needs. The colors are so
  vibrant and fun, we get tons of compliments from all our company.
  All the kids gravitate towards it</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">I love this puzzle! It is fun and
  challenging. I believe that it is a good puzle for anyone who
  wants a challenge. However I find that there is one problem with
  it. THERE ARE NO DIMENSIONS TO TELL YOU HOW BIG THE PUZZLE IS
  AFTER YOU PUT IT TOGRTHER!!! I would appreciate it if dimensions
  were added to the box. I am sure that anyone else who purchases
  this puzzle would appreciate it to so that they know if they are
  going to have to purchase a puzzle mat as well if they order this
  puzzle. If you like puzzles that are not your everyday puzzle I
  would recommend that you purchase this puzzle because it would
  make a worthy addition to any puzzle collection</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">I love this doll i only saw her in

  <Text category="toys_games">I understand the people who install
  car seats who feel this item isn't needed and distrust its lack
  of crash testing, but my infant car seats are hand-me-downs
  without LATCH. My car has LATCH, but does not seem to have the
  kind of seat belts that stay tight. My car seat doesn't just get
  a little loose... you can move it 4 or 5 inches side to side if
  you try. It may be that a car seat tech could train me to do a
  better job with the locking clip, but I can't get it to stop
  this. And one of the seats was given to me without a locking clip
  at all. I have no problem tightening the seat belt enough - it
  just won't stay that way. This product allows me to tighten the
  car seat enough to meet the "one inch" spec. Nothing else has. So
  it definitely adds to my baby's safety. Finally- to the car seat
  techs- with the number of these that have been sold, it doesn't
  appear that anyone has come forward to say that it failed in a
  crash. Just because it hasn't been crash-tested does not mean it
  is unsafe. And there is absolutely nothing wrong with aftermarket
  goods as a rule, tho manufacturers will ALWAYS tell you
  otherwise</Text>

  <Text category="toys_games">I purchased this item when my
  daughter was one year old, and it was amazing! My daughter was
  always a good sleeper, but when she began teething at around 9-10
  months old, she began refusing to stay in her crib each night. I
  was out of ideas, and my husband and I had tried just about every
  method we read about without success. Finally, I found the Tomy
  Star Bright Light, and it was like a miracle worker! The first
  night I used it, my daughter put herself to sleep in her crib by
  staring at the ceiling. Each night, her sleeping became better
  and better. Now, we only run it once for 10 minutes and she falls
  asleep. It is a much better approach then allowing your child to
  "cry it out". She actually enjoys going to sleep now and looks
  forward to watching the light show before she falls
  asleep.</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">Grandchildren just about wore it out
  putting it together so many times...</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">We bought this puzzle for my then 2
  year old as he had mastered the barn puzzle (which is also
  amazing). There are monkeys, tigers, butterflies, and numerous
  other jungle animals. I had to look up several of the animals as
  I was not sure of what they were. This was a good educational
  experience for both me and my son. This puzzle is durable as are
  all of the M&amp;amp;D floor puzzles. It has been stepped on and
  thrown across the room by a highly rambunctions child. I have had
  this puzzle for over a year, and it looks great. I rotate this
  puzzle with the other Melissa and Doug floor puzzzles that we
  have. I recommend any of their floor puzzles as they are great
  quality and have easy to handle pieces for kids. They are a great
  opportunity to teach about different subjects and teach new words
  to children</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">I bought this for my 4 1/2 yr old
  daughter for xmas and she was extremely impressed along with
  myself. It's exactly like the "real thing" just smaller! Very
  durable, colorful, and fun! It's great to use with the Zapf
  Creation dolls that tend to weigh more than a smaller baby doll
  b/c the car seat is so sturdy. Unlike most car seats this doesn't
  collapse and fold up whenever you actually try to carry it by the
  handle! It is definately worth the price</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">You might be disappointed if you were
  expecting the exact same thing as the original 1984 Optimus Prime
  toy (or wanted a trailer for the truck), but this is an updated
  version of the original character, as opposed to a remake, and is
  superior in many ways. It is durable, detailed, well-articulated,
  and fun, especially with the truck parts forming weapons for the
  robot. I'd recommend it for kids and nostalgic adults
  alike</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">This product is not the best ever
  created, as the Roxxi doll that comes with it is not the
  prettiest of Bratz dolls. She has huge black and red streaks in
  her hair, as well as an oddly-shaped head. However, one gets used
  to her and can even find her pretty. The stage itself is a great
  product, but plugging it in to your stereo is more confusing than
  you might think. This playset comes with a microphone that is
  different from the regular Rock Angelz microphone, as it is gray
  and of a different style. Also included is a faux-snakeskin
  chair, Roxxi, a guitar, and a few accessories, like bottled water
  and make up compacts. The stage itself is rather nice, and I
  strongly suggest the Instrumentz if you buy this. However, be
  warned that it is not the BEST of Bratz products, despite its
  appeal. It's rather nice, though. :</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">I love this nativity even though it I
  think it is pricey. There are no other ones like it. They are
  Fisher Price Little People so you know they will hold up forever!
  There aren't any other plastic nativity sets out there. Get the
  set that plays the song when you place the angel on top of the
  stable. It is so worth the price when you know they will play
  with it every year. I even take this to church when I teach my
  3and4yr old class about Jesus birth. They LOVE it</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">My niece was learning about the birth
  of Christ at school when I got her this Nativity Set. She was so
  happy and it was so easy for me to continue teaching her about
  the birth of Christ and Christmas. Thanks - I was very satisfied
  with this item and so was my niece</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">My 5 and 7 year olds have gotten a
  lot of use out of this toy. It is a strong microphone and seems
  to be made very well. They love to pretend to be rock stars! My
  only complaint about the toy is there is no volume control.... so
  you only get one level...LOUD. I would recommend it for any child
  that likes to sing</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">I don't understand why they are so
  offensive to people. I am Christian, and I lvoe all three
  Midnight Dance dolls. I think they are more 'Phantom of the
  Opera' than 'Sadistic Satinist'. Meygan is my favorite, but
  Yasmin is still beautiful. These dolls are gourgeous</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">I bought this Brio train set for my 2
  1/2 year old niece over Christmas, and she absolutely loves it!
  It's a great starter set and can be expanded with other Brio
  track sets. Very easy to put together and the pieces are durable.
  Makes a great gift</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">I bought this play tent for my
  15-month old daughter for Christmas. She loves going through the
  curtain entrances and plays peek a boo through the little window.
  She's a little rough on the door, not realizing the door opens
  outward. But she's a little young still to understand the full
  extent of the play tent. All in all, worth the money</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">Nuparu is SWEET! But, sadly, his
  skull does not glow in the dark. Nuparu has black/gray armor, a
  light up sword with a strobe effect, two claws, and a Zamor
  sphere launcher attached to his back. You must be careful with
  the zamor spheres, though, because they're easy to lose. Now I
  have Toa Matoro and Toa Nuparu! YOU HAVR TO BUY THIS
  TOY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">I bought my son this toy after
  reading all the bad reviews.I agree that you cant reach all the
  buttons in the time allocated but he loves it and watches it move
  round the room. I recommend this product for 9 month olds</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">I LOVE this thing! GREAT product,
  GREAT deal, GREAT times to look forward to with my grandson - he
  simply goes nuts over it! Thanks</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">Bought Blue, Majenta and Periwinkle

  <Text category="toys_games">Damn! I just got the yostick and took
  it to the local gym and streets to demo some new tricks. At first
  I had some doubts about the durability of it but after some heavy
  duty urban testing, it's still mad tricking. In other words, I've
  been trying pretty hard to break it. For it's price, the yostick
  is incredible fun. In an age of pricey video-games, $10.99 is not
  a high price for something that provides exercise, fun and an
  introduction to the movement and breathing rhythms of martial
  arts. A value-priced training tool, not a toy at all. The
  movement required by the yostick will help martial arts beginners
  have fun while learning precise hand-eye controls. The ends are
  fitted with rubber tips making it a joy to trick directly off the
  ground. Looking forward to collecting other models. Enjoy

  <Text category="toys_games">My friends and I, all in college, are
  major movie buffs, so when another friend told me about the game,
  I was eager to try it. Some parts are tough, but with the team
  setup of the game, it seems to even out. Favourite rounds were
  Still Crazy: a round where scenes are built piece by piece, a
  word association round: 6 clues are provided and the idea is to
  name the movie, and the quotes round, of course! The hardest
  rounds were the matching and the trivia rounds. Still, we had
  great fun. Its better if the teams are evenly matched, then its
  more fun. The main objection I have is that in the 8 rounds, many
  of the movies are dated and overused. There are great ones,
  though...Rain Man, Cast Away!! Also, this game is linear in
  progression, there is no variation in the order of the questions.
  Scoring uses the honour system. There are 3 games, each lasting
  around 45 minutes at the very fastest, its the same as the cost
  of a regular DVD and is much more fun with lots of people. I have
  bought this for several people and some of my friends have as
  well. Recently I played a game where a 12 year old and an 82 year
  old were playing so don't worry about the age thing, both enjoyed
  it. Really, I recommend it</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">Best price I saw for this doll and it
  came in the mail in a very short time, wrapped securely. I love
  when you can shop online, beat the crowds and get quality
  merchandise. Beautiful doll too</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">I bought this for my son for
  Christmas, which at the time he was only 14 months old. The age
  says from 18 months. The problem is he can't hold the button down
  to make it go so I have to walk around the train and hold the
  button for him. We had a playgroup over and there were kids that
  were over 2 years old and they couldn't hold the button down
  either. Overall my son loves it but its not age appropriate for
  him. Also, this toy is cheaper at Toys-R-Us. I got ours when it
  was on sale for $[...]. After Christmas they had them on sale
  half off for $[...]</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">This Angel is sure to be a gem in any
  collectors collection. She is elegant and graceful. Her gown in
  beautiful as well as her spiral curled hair. She is adorned in a
  golden head chain. She has a chain sash which is also part of her
  gown. At last she is given beautiful golden wings and holds a
  bouquet of flowers. This one will definately be worth the value
  in the years to come</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">THIS IS A VERY BEAUTIFUL DOLL. I LOVE
  DOLLS, BARBIE AND I ALSO LOVE ANGELS. UNFORTUNATELY THIS DOLL IS
  ALSO VERYYYYY EXPENSIVE! I WOUDL LOVE TO HAVE HER BUT NOT AT THIS
  PRICE. I WILL WAIT UNTIL THE PRICE DROPS OR I WILL LOOK FOR HER
  ON E-BAY. I WILL NOT PAY OVER 40 DOLLARS FOR THIS DOLL. NO MATTER
  HOW PRETTY SHE IS! I DO GIVER HER 5 STARS THOUGH. VERY NICE
  DOLL</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">As with all the leap frog products,
  this ones a lot of fun. Packed full of learning surprises. I have
  always felt that making learning fun and easy cuts down on the
  fact that it's 'work'. The Birthday Surprise is fun and full of
  rhyming words, that make little one want to learn. I have a hard
  time giving any leapfrog products anything but a 5 star rating,
  because of the quality in all their products. Learning last a
  lifetime, so get them started with fun friends from Leap
  Frog.</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">This case is nice and tough, it holds
  all the accessories for the FP3 player securely. I gave it 4
  stars because I think things like FP3 players need a home and it
  serves that purpose great. It matches with the player and is
  built to withstand kids. I did take a star off my rating because,
  as it does have a smallish loop to hold it by, it should really
  have a handle. Little hands need something easy to hold on to,
  and the little loop does not suffice for any purpose I could
  see</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">My three children are huge fans of
  Melissa and Doug puzzles and with as many as we own we sure
  needed a way to store them neatly. Being an organization freak
  myself, I was in search of the perfect storage case. Not only did
  it need to hold many puzzles, but it needed to be made well and
  look nice too. Melissa and Doug to the rescue - once again! We
  purchased the same storage case in natural and it's been a life
  saver in our toy room - it makes it easy for them to put the
  puzzles away without them losing pieces anymore. You might find
  it hard to spend $30 on an empty storage case so I suggest
  looking for the storage case that comes with six puzzles for $60
  instead. More for your money! In our case, we own so many puzzles
  that we didn't need anymore and especially duplicates of what we
  already have</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">I bought this bed for my two year old
  because he got too big for his crib. He moves around A LOT in his
  sleep so I wanted a safe first bed for him. He absolutely loves
  this bed and actually he is sleeping much better now than he was
  before. The only problem was that the mattress and box spring we
  bought were too high, so we just use the mattress for now.
  Eventually we'll put the box spring back in.</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">1. Tape as many Jenga sticks together
  with masking tape on one side to support a favorite picture that
  you would like to turn into a special puzzle. 2. Have your child
  find a any picture they would like to turn into a puzzle (even a
  favorite photo can work.) 3. Glue whole picture to opposite side
  of masked taped Jenga. 4. Shellac and allow to dry 5. Use excto
  knife and cut the picture apart. 6. Remove tape and voila`--your
  own hand-made puzzle! Even toddlers can put a 5 piece puzzle of
  an animal or fruit together and they love creating their own
  puzzle! Enjoy! Aloha</Text>

  because his older cousin has one. I had searched in stores around
  me wanting to buy it but no one had it. Sure enough I found it on
  Amazon. It's a lot of fun to play with and he just loves to rock

  <Text category="toys_games">I purchased this Train Case for my
  son last Christmas, (age 6). It is very sturdy, with handle. I
  like that all the trains can be put into one place and carried
  away simply/easily. Those moms like myself, when your child has
  finished playing, there is now a place for them to put their
  trains in. The 'metal' case is a great added bonus, the trains
  have the magnetic ends and they easily go into case. Next play
  time, the trains are all in one spot. Thomas, come up with a
  place like this for the track - I need it</Text>

  <Text category="toys_games">I bought the Harry Potter Magic
  Puzzles for my nieces and I scored some major brownie points.
  They loved this at first because it was about their hero, Harry
  Potter, however, they play with it for hours on end. Putting the
  puzzles together is fun in itself, but then there are the cool
  magic tricks and the VERY COOL optical illusion using the spiral
  disk too. This is great for any kid interested in magic, as well
  jigsaw puzzles and Harry! A big thumbs up</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">everything was great! great bed, easy

  <Text category="toys_games">I was very happy with the product I
  purchased and I received it in a timely fashion. The product was
  not worn nor used. It was as if I bought it at the store at a
  lower cost. It was a win/win for me. Thank you</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">Our 3 children have had hours of fun
  with this toy during the 2+ years we've had it in our home. True,
  the food is long gone (cardboard boxes - toddlers - no surprise
  there). We've also needed lash the front piece on with some
  string (again, it's not constructed to be a bumper car but
  toddlers don't often keep their play inside the box). The simple
  design means that when they twist it beyond reason, it's flexible
  enough for me to pop it back into alignment. It's small enough to
  be comfortable for the 2 year old to push(for hours), and close
  enough to the real thing to remain interesting for a 5-6 year
  old. It's gender neutral, forgiving enough to go down a flight of
  stairs (repeatedly) without breaking, light enough to not squish
  whatever's at the bottom.... and sometimes they do even use it to
  play grocery</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">I bought two of these trucks for my
  twin boys when they were 16 months old. They loved it so much and
  the bubbles come out the front for added fun. The music and lots
  of buttons to push, a storage under the seat and a fire helmet
  makes this a fabulous toy. My boys are now 27 months and have not
  stopped playing with this truck!! Its great, buy it, buy
  it!</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">My kids (4.5 and 1) love this car.
  The sounds it makes are great. They take turns riding on it and
  the other one pushing. It is quite durable and they play with it
  all the time. Only negative is that some of the stickers peeled
  off. Overall, it's a great toy and the kids play with it every
  day</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">He's into firetrucks and Mickey Mouse
  so you couldn't ask for a better toy. It's small enough to ride
  around the house without running into everything, but also
  durable enough to play outside with. It's the first thing he goes
  for in the morning and the last thing he's playing with at night
  (most days)</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">This is the Optimus Prime that should
  have been made 20 years age. It was a difficult decision whether
  to open it or save it in the original packaging. Finally
  nostalgia won out and I had to transform him. It was amazing. The
  transformation took time but it was worth the wait. I felt like a
  kid again. I am totally satified with this product.</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">theres a few things the are nice
  about this prime and things that arent pros:extrem detail
  coloring is good megatron rifle is sweet mouth moves cons:primes
  regular gun will barley fit in primes hands bit more platic then
  die cast a pain to transform pushing legs in most of all sound
  base sounds like a ultra magnus mixed with prime I can find more
  cons then pros I would ONLY get this toy for some one 11 or older
  not somebody who goes all wild and takes there toys every where
  oh wait another PRO!:primes leg vents open when you stand him
  u</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">I just transformed it for the first
  time into a truck. It was challenging but doable. Probably one of
  the coolest toys ever, but I was an 80's child. As someone else
  mentioned, the grill in front does not quite align with the cab
  windows when it's all set, but other than that it's great.
  Tremendous amount of detail (moveable leg vents, head, mouth,
  individual fingers/thumb poseable, light behind Matrix, datacom
  interface, working shocks on the wheels, and accessories). It's
  quite tall and heavy for a toy- very impressive. If a piece snaps
  off from forcing it the wrong way, it is designed to snap back
  on. I never got to own a Transformer as a teen but my lost
  childhood is now officially redeemed. This will adorn my office
  cube as a conversation piece</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">The instructions could of been better
  on the hooks and the net but you could figure it out. You had to
  take the target out that they gave you because if you hit it it
  would slow the ball down. Then you just put ribbon on the outline
  of the other target. Otherwise I it is holding up great so
  far!</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">My son saved and bought this with his
  own money. Very durable, great for catching practice my son is

  <Text category="toys_games">I've been wanting this forever and
  when I got it,it was totally AWSOME!! First it comes with a
  really,really cool chair (that you are going to LOVE!),it also
  comes with a SWEET guitar with amp (FYI. the amp has some really
  cool stickers on it) and it also includes two (2) guitar
  magazines. I truly LOVE this piece mainly because I've always
  wanted an amp for my guitars. Oh,I HIGHLY,HIGHLY recommend this
  you'll LOVE it! Well hope this helps. :)</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">I purchased this as a birthday gift
  for my 11 year old grandson. I knew it would be a hit as my son
  had received it as a gift from his grandparents as a child and
  was entertained for hours with it. It did not lose it's charm for
  11 year old boys through the years. My grandson was thrilled with
  it as well. Just enough challenge to keep their interest</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">Our three Asian-American
  granddaughters got these today for Christmas and they love them!
  Ignore the 5-star reviews that trash these cute little dolls,
  then try to steer you to eBay for another doll. These are the
  genuine article and kids LOVE them, as they have for generations.
  Our thirty-plus daughter-in-law still has her original Cabbage
  Patch doll, and she still loves it, just as her daughters loved
  theirs today</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">The game is fun....we played it when
  we lost electricity during Hurricane Isabel and was kept
  entertained! I dont know if I would take everything in the game
  as seriously as everyone else is, writing bad reviews. If you

  far! This game is fun and makes you think and re-think what you
  THINK you know! I suggest it for teens</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">My daughter received this toy for her
  fourth birthday. She plays with it all the time!!! It didn't come
  with any tapes and honestly she doesn't need them! She spends
  quite some time speaking into the microphone and using the slide
  to change the sound of her voice. It is so funny! We all get a
  kick out of it. There are several different sounds to choose
  from. Even her two year old twin sisters get into the act. They
  love it. Love this toy. It's extremely durable. Would absolutely
  recommend this</Text>

  <Text category="toys_games">I bought this house for my daughter
  who will be 3 in 2 month's. I did a lot of research and was torn
  between the twin town house and this one the Loving Family Sweet
  Sound's house. At first I almost went with the My first doll
  house by Fisher Price but was told by a friend she would proberly
  grow out of that fast and she was right. This house the Sweet
  Sound's is a perfect size for her and I know she will get quite a
  few year's out of it. Yes the Furniture is impossible to find.
  After reading the review's I didn't look for it much knowing I
  would never find it. I ended up buying her the Twin town's
  bathroom and a few pieces from the My first doll house by Fisher
  Price. The pieces work perfect together and are chunkier for her
  and not so many tiny pieces. They work great with the doll's that
  come with it too. I did also purchase one doll set from twin town
  house. The house does make some sound's with just the pieces that
  come with it, they are cute and my daughter doesn't know any
  better that it would make more if we could of found the correct
  sweet sounds furniture. She's Happy with the way it is. I decided
  against the Twin Town because I agreed with some reviewers after
  looking at it that the room's were too tiny. Yes you get more
  room's but my daughter I know would get so frusterated with
  alway's knocking the furniture over in those tiny room's. This
  house has big room's. It fold's up easy in half but not so good
  when it is filled with furniture. We leave it open anyway's so
  that is not a big deal. It was easy put together but the
  sticker's took about and hour to put on. Also a note make sure
  and put the battery in BEFORE you fill it with furniture, I put
  the battery in last and ended up spilling the furniture
  everywhere. Also I didn't see any one mention the front door. I
  am not really sure why but it doesn't open from the outside, only
  from the inside. You can open it from the outside but you have to
  pull it very hard and really aren't supose to open it that way.
  Why not be able to open it both way's??? I guess their thinking
  is so if you are moving it so the door doesn't swing open but
  they could of put a little latch on it so you could of closed it
  shut when you wanted. Also I am not sure what room is supose to
  be the bathroom. I think it is either the bedroom or above that
  which I thought was the kid's playroom. I ended up putting the
  bathroom in the right side of the bathroom. All in all I think is
  is a great doll house and I would recommend it</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">This Emperor Penguin Puppet is a real
  hit with my 5 year old. We almost never use it as a puppet but
  rather as a plush toy/pal. This penguin looks round and pregnant,
  but to my kid, this penguin is a perfect friend. He has pretty
  much outgrown all of his plush toys, but for some reason, this
  one has a place in his heart and in his imagination</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">I have an infant in-home daycare and
  needed a quad stoller for my four babies. When I first found
  these connectors, no one could tell me if they would connect two
  tandem double strollers together. I asked every store in town
  almost (some didn't even know what they were!). I just decided to
  buy them and hoped that they would work. So I went out and bought
  two Kolcraft Lil' Limo strollers, not knowing, of course, if it
  would work or not. I'm happy to say that they seem to work really
  well! I did have to buy a second set, though, so I have five
  connectors on mine(couldn't find room for the sixth one). Just
  lock the two inner front wheels so they can't turn and you're
  off! It is a little hard to turn corners(just take them at a wide
  angle), but otherwise it works great! I ended up spending just
  under [price] for the total cost of it, much less buying an
  actual quad stroller. I hope this info will be helpful to someone
  else also. Good luck</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">I just got the whole set of geotrax
  and really think they look great and way cheaper than Thomas
  however the round housecan only hold one train at a time so it
  derails the train if you have more than one locomotive. they
  really need to add the reverse as well so they kids and me ( mom
  ) LOL can really make use of all the options. However, overall I
  really love this toy but yes I had to convert my office room into
  the Geotrax room. be ready to do this if not stick to the basic
  set up. Its very hard though since it all is so coo</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">I was very pleased when this toy
  finally arrived. The Blue Devil is removable and semi-posable
  (his arms move). He is the same size as the Simpson figures from
  the Playmates line of toys, so I feel like he was made with
  collectors of those figures in mind. The Homer donut-eating
  action doesn't always work correctly--the mouth and donuts aren't
  correctly synchronized, so sometimes the donuts miss his
  mouth--but that does not detract from the fun</Text>

  <Text category="toys_games">I played "Atmosfear, The Harbingers"
  on VHS in the mid-90s and several years later bought a copy of
  the game through ebay. Then, I saw this DVD update and gave in to
  temptation when the price was marked down. Here's my judgement:
  1) The mechanics have been simplified. This has it's pros and
  cons. It could have been made easier to learn without removing as
  many components. 2) The gatekeeper has less of a nasty/funny
  balance in the DVD update. 3) It is a major upswing to have his
  dialogue randomly disbursed. One reviewer seemed to think the
  game was boring. I'll guess, instead, that the people he parties
  with don't have the attention span for board games. Too bad for
  them. Atmosfear - The DVD Board Game get's a B+ from me</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">This is a well thought of game. A
  game where the players play along with the DVD as the Gatemaster
  gives you commands, rewards, or punishiments while they are
  playing the game. Players can also watch the rules and the setup
  instructions on the DVD. Six keys of six different types will be
  laid out on some of the spaces, as your goal is to get one of
  each type and rush to the center before 49 minutes is up. If
  neither player wins in 49 minutes, the Gate master has defeated
  you. In the beginning you write down your fears and reveal them
  at the end which is always fun. The board has six territories.
  Each character owns a territory which has a set of the same keys.
  You can pick up a key by landing on the key space, having a card
  telling you to, gate master telling you to, or winning a duel. A
  duel is when you land on a battle space and 2 players wager a key
  for a dice roll to see who gets both. There are two types of
  cards... TIME and FATE. Land on a skull head and get a FATE card
  which allows you to do something in a certain situation. A TIME
  card you get if you land on a clock. A time card allows you to do
  something if you play it in the exact second it tells you to.
  Sometimes the Gate master will give you the power to banish
  someone. When there is reward, there is also punisment. If you
  land on the cursed key, you have to pick it up and whenever you
  have it, you cannot win. If you are landed into a black hole, you
  cannot participate until you are freed. Also, you can lose keys.
  During the game the Gate master says "Stop!" frequently and the
  players will have to lisen to what he says or be punished. All in
  all, it is one of the best games out there and well worth the
  money.</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">The 1st version of this game was a
  fun and exiting game for my family. but we soon got bored of the
  same video over and over. We could not believe it when we saw a
  new version of the game out, we rushed out to buy it and found
  this version not the same and not as complicated or as fun as the
  first they should have just released the first version of the
  game with new dvd setup it was a waste of money</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">This toy is wonderful for several
  reasons. For one thing, it's really the only shape sorter your
  child will ever need. It has very basic shape sorting (with cut
  out holes in the sides and one door that can be opened for any
  shape block to go in), plus pretty complex shape sorting when you
  open various locks. The toy also helps teach colors and animals,
  and the locks develop fine motor skills even further. Overall,
  this toy is very well made. It's real wood, dove tailed together.
  It could, of course, fall over, but if your child is the 18
  months or older that is recommended for this toy, he or she
  probably isn't small enough for it to hurt. The locks on this toy
  are a little more chintzy. They wobble, which makes locking or
  unlocking some of them more difficult...But you could look at
  this as just another learning tool. My biggest concern is that
  the blocks are relatively small; they could squeeze through a
  toilet paper tube. This means they are a potential choking
  hazard, so you'll want to supervise when your child uses this
  toy. All that said, my 20 month old LOVES this toy and plays with
  it more than anything else she has</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">As a mother of 5, this toy has proven
  to be one of my favorites of all time. My son received it for
  Christmas (at age 2 months) and it has been wonderful. We place
  it in his bed at naps and at night, and he goes to sleep watching
  and listening to it. When he wakes up, it is there for him to
  play with. As he has grown (he is now 7 months), he has become
  increasingly more interested in the sounds and textures of the
  toy, and now puts the corners in his mouth which has helped with
  teething. I have been impressed with the sound quality (it is not
  annoying like most musical children's toys) and I will be anxious
  to see if it causes my son to love music on a different level.
  LOVE THIS TOY!</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">My six month old enjoys this. It can
  keep him occupied for 10-15 minutes at a time, and the music is
  quite pleasant and soft. Good toy</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">I bought this for my 6 month old
  granddaughter and she loves it! The music quality is great and
  she really enjoys the lights. It has a very sweet face and she
  smiles and talks to it a lot. I got it on clearance which is good
  because as cute as it is, I don't think it is worth the original
  price. I would definately recommend it if you can get it on
  sale</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">This doll is cute and fun to play
  with. My daughter loves it. I like these dolls better then bratz.
  They need to make more dolls that are dressed the way kids are. I
  think that Lil does. Im happy and my daughter has a toy I think
  will be around for a long time.</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">It is a very nice product. I bought
  if for my 1 year old grandbaby to take to nursery with him. I put
  in pictures of the family so he could look at them with his
  teachers. My daughter says it very useful, and he is adapting to
  his nursery quicker.</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">This is a super fun toy that my
  daughter has had now for over a year. If you can find it ANYWHERE
  I would highly recommend it. It plays pre-programmed songs plus
  your child can also be her own musician and even record her music
  for playback. The microphone is nice for aspiring American Idols
  (like my daughter!) and it really is pretty. We did lose the
  dancing Cinderella with Prince Charming, but while we had it is
  was beautiful to watch them dance while the piano played. It also
  does a pretty light show. I cannot give this toy enough stars as
  it is a really wonderful toy for 3-6 year old girls</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">I got this yesterday for my daughters
  (3 &amp;amp; 6 years old), and they like it very much...let's see
  how long that lasts. The space is kind of cramped, but both of
  them fit in there with a few dolls, so I wouldn't complain about
  that. Setting it up was pretty easy, and although it has almost
  no stability (it gets toppled every couple of minutes or so),
  that doesn't seem to take away the fun from it. However, there
  were a couple of surprises for me: a) The product I got is very
  different from the picture in the advertisement. It is still
  shaped like a castle and has the Disney Princesses and all, but
  it is just different. I am not complaining, my girls like it a
  lot. b) As I said before, setting it up was fairly easy (just
  keep your face away as you take it out of the box, for it will
  spring out on you VERY FAST), but, trying to disassemble it and
  putting it away is a completely different story. For that, you
  have to remove 4 rods (which were not so easy to insert in the
  first place), and then, you have to fold the thing away twisting
  it in a way that only experienced snake handlers would be
  expected of being able to do so (I don't care how easy it should
  be according to the instructions). I tried it for about 20
  minutes until I gave up. And, if you don't keep the box this
  thing came in, just forget about storing it folded, it would be
  like trying to keep a "Jack in the Box" compressed without the
  "Box". Think about it. So, if you don't mind adding this to the
  permanent decor of your house, go for it, your girls will
  probably like it.</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">My 2 year old daughter recently
  recieved this as a present from her grandparents. She loves the
  disney princesses and was ver excited. I was happy to see how
  easy it was to put up and take down, she plays with it in her
  room almost everyday and I love the fact that we can take it down
  before she goes to sleep. Overall we are very pleased with this
  tent, although it would be nice if it was a bit bigger so that I
  could play in there with her</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">I was disappointed when I opened the
  box and set up the tent because it was much smaller than I
  expected it to be. My friend's daughter has an almost identical
  tent which is much bigger. Apparently there are two different
  kinds, one made by Playhut and one made by The Disney
  Store</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">I gave this as a gift to a friend who
  is a huge fan. I've never seen a 29 year old so happy as he made
  the whoosh noise as Starscream flew around in jet form. Great
  quality, durable, and fun to play with</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">I just gotten this yesterday for my
  12th birthday and I love her so much! She is beautfiul and her
  hair is so soft, the clothes are adorable and she comes with a
  poster that comes in a accesorie bag for all of you Bratz Kidz
  accessories! This doll is the best! I am going to get the other
  Bratz Kidz for Christmas!!!!!!!!!</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">We received Boggle Jr as a gift at
  Christmas. My daughter is almost four and absolutely loves this
  game. She is learning her words and is learning to spell. This is
  a wonderful game for learning picture recognition and
  verbalization and moving on to spelling three and four letter
  words. I told my sister and she requested it for her son. He's a
  happy camper with the game, too</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">My son is 4 1/2 and he loved the set.
  He and his dad set it up on Christmas and enjoyed ringing the
  bell. I would recommend this for kids any age</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">The Suduko Board Game is the perfect
  gift for the older kids on your lists. It is well made and can be
  played by one or two so they can use it alone or with friends.
  Since it is wood it will last a long time whether it is being
  played by middle schoolers or college kids. Also, I paid $17.99
  for this and have not found it anywhere near this price. It is
  usually $29.99 to $39.99 for the exact same game</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">My little cousin sarah loves this
  toy. i bought it at wal-mart in springfield. it works with or
  without water and features realistic sounds. i am now on my way
  to purchase another for my 6 year old cousin sean</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">My 6 year old loves this. yes it is
  small but who wants a big toy around the house this can go right
  on a shelf when not being played with I would get it again if I
  did not already have it</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">This doll is so beautful. Back off
  everybody, I am the bratz number 1 fan with over 120 of them!
  Seriously, and thats not all, I go on the website 4 hours a day,
  and am collecting bratz babyz and have many bratz furniture.
  Consider me the bratz expert. OK so hi everybody! I'm here to
  give you some tips 'n' tricks as well as handy hints on this
  particular talking bratz doll, who is my fave character YASMIN!
  This doll, for starters, is a mixture of diferent bratz
  collections. She has a bratz princess T-Shirt, wildwest cowboy
  a-go-go boots, forever diamonds fur, Bratz Fabulous coat and
  Passion For Fashion miniskirt. I mean Whoa! If you wanted to buy
  any of those dolls listed above, just get this! She is a mixture
  of all! Secondly, she talks! Which is great. She is also
  interactive, saying over 125 phrases. If you place her with other
  talking bratz dolls, she will get excited and start to have a
  conversation! She can also talk to you if you are lonely. She has
  a sensor so she 'knows' what yor saying and can give a correct
  answer! Also, she'll be your best friend at nightime. her lips
  light up while she speaks! The base at the bottom can be removed
  so she can be like a regular bratz doll! If you, however, press
  the button on the base, her lips wll still light up as she
  speaks. And at only $19.99 , parents, all of you parents out
  there, you don't know what your missing</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">My 6 year old loves this toy. She
  made all 3 bears at one time. My husband helped her. They are
  well made and close up in the back with a zipper and special
  tool, so they do not come undone unless you want to open them and
  re-stuff them</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">We bought my son a couple of
  starfighters, the tri-fighter, the AT-RT, and the wheel bike. He
  loves the starfighters and likes the AT-RT a little. He rarely
  plays with the wheel bike. I think the starfighters are just
  simpler, sturdier, and easier to play with. The wheel bike (and
  to a smaller extent the AT-RT) are more complicated, and thus
  less fun for a 5-year old. We run around having mock dog-fights
  with the starfighters, but poor old General Grievous sits in the
  toy box. Overall, probably good for older kids who can more
  expertly manipulate the legs and other stuff, but not all that
  fun for the younger guys</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">These blocks are so great! They've
  gone through their different stages of growth. They learned to
  reach for them, peek inside, grasp them, toss them around and now
  stacking them to make towers. My triplets are 20 mos and have had
  them for about a year. Love them all</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">All of the peek a blocks are fun.
  Although each set has a different 'theme' they are very similar
  and enjoyable to play with. These blocks are great fun. Each
  block has something interesting inside it. In our house these
  have been played with by boys and pretty roughly at times. The
  windows to see inside are still clear and not one of these blocks
  have broken. So I would say they are sturdy and hold up well to
  normal play. On the ends of each block is a texture. Within each
  block is something interesting. And many blocks have an activity
  associated with it- push a button to make a noise, twist a knob
  to make something turn around etc. The one thing I would warn is
  that these blocks do not stack well, particularly in tall towers.
  So if you are thinking of buying these for tower building, I'd
  consider a different set of blocks. Otherwise, these are
  excellent toys. They provide a basis for communication and
  vocubulary building with your child. They are sturdy and
  encourage language, eye hand coordination and so on. If you enjoy
  toys that are fairly quiet, do more than have a push button to
  make a noise, foster independent creative play and exploration of
  the world this is an excellent toy. Enjoy.</Text>

  <Text category="toys_games">My daughter has trouble concentrating
  in school. I got this for her birthday and her grades instantly
  improved to the point where her teacher stated that there was a
  noticable improvement in all areas of her work. The best thing
  about it is that I don't have to tell her to use it because she
  loves it. I told her it's just like having a laptop because she
  always wanted a computer of her own. This is as close as I'm
  willing to get concenrning her having her own computer at her
  age, plus it's a minute fraction of the price of a personal
  laptop. For children who don't have a hard time in school, this
  may not be for them but for my daughter it is a whole lot of what
  I needed to help me help her learn. I just wish I could find an
  adapter.</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">First I have to say Thank You to
  Amazon for having this game. This was on my daughter's Christmas
  list and Amazon was the only place I could find it. Second, my
  daughter loves this game and so do her friends. They have played

  <Text category="toys_games">In Boggle, players compete against
  one another and a 3-minute hourglass to find word combinations
  across randomly distibuted letter cubes on a 4x4 grid. The game
  develops pattern recognition skills, and because most possible
  words are only three or four letters long, astute younger players
  can play adults without too much of s handicap. Tactics learned
  playing Boggle translate well into success at Scrabble and other
  word games, while the clock management skills help with chess and
  test taking. Boggle is lightweight and makes a good travel game,
  though you might want to bring a zipper-lock sandwich bag to
  avoid losing the letter cubes. As an added plus, the game can be
  played solitaire with minimal dropoff in entertainment value. If
  you enjoy Boggle, you might want to seek out Big Boggle, which
  uses a 5-by-5 grid (56% more cubes). Words and time limit are
  both longer.</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">I received this Ty pig as a baby
  shower gift. My son "discovered" it when he was 18 months old and
  it's his dearest companion besides his "night-night." Piggy must
  go for car rides, eat with him, get jammies on and go to the Dr.
  to have his temperature checked. We love Piggy because when he's
  covered with milky Cheerios, we can just throw him in the washer
  and dryer. He's good as new in about an hour. Who wouldn't love
  that? It's also a great toy for allergy sufferers because it can
  be thoroughly cleaned regularly to remove dust mites. We love it
  and my son loves it. Now we ordered a spare Piggy so that there
  is a Piggy substitute when Piggy is bathing. Enjoy your
  toddler</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">We originally bought this game at the
  Chiricahua National Monument in Arizona for our kids (8 and 10
  years old at the time) and they loved it. We love that it's
  Monopoly, but one that creates interest in visiting our national
  parks.</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">I just bought this doll @ Toys R Us
  and I was also able to purchase The Hilary Duff Shopping Sisters
  doll which is supposed to include her sister Haylie Duff which
  isn't available yet. I have the two other Hilary dolls the first
  of which was released in 2002 or 2003 and it was a Lizzie McGuire
  doll which doesn't look much like Hilary at all. Then there was
  the Hilary dolls released by Playmates which had a more slight
  resemblance than the first doll. Now Mattel has made a doll of
  Hilary Duff and it is by far the most visibly accurate doll I've
  seen. And the clothes and accessories are really cute too. I
  think a lot of girls would love this doll and possibly older fans
  too. I'm just waiting for the Haylie Duff doll to debut early
  next year and her doll also bears a striking resemblance. The
  dolls are available @ Toys R Us, KB Toys, Wal-Mart all under
  $20.00.</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">I think this a great item for a child
  over 3 1/2. Since there are 4 puzzles in one box, our son, who
  just turned 3 has a hard time keeping the pieces separate. They
  are symbol coded on the back, so I think once he gets older it
  will get easier. He loves the pictures and I love that the pieces
  are sturdy and how much he is learning. Highly recommnde</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">this pony has proved (along with the
  Princess Promenade) to be one of the most popular of the my
  little pony's we have bought. It comes with a pink skirt, a pink
  crown and high heel shoes. The most popular item was the dressing
  table with revolving mirror and after several months it still
  hasn't broken despite harsh treatemnt. The pony is white with
  silver strands through the mane and tail. It was very pretty but
  the rough treatment really does make the mane matted very
  quickly. Also, think about getting white pony's very seriously
  for younger children, While the coloured ones can be drawn on
  with pen and the stains wiped off and at least partly concealed -
  on white ponys it is impossible to hide. For the younger ones (3
  year olds) it is hard to get them not to at first. Desert Rose
  was very pretty but is now a bit stained and sorry looking. Never
  the less she is integral in my children's games still which is
  nice. One of the more popular ponies we have bought. Generally
  very hard wearing, including the accessories, the only item which
  has been broken is the crown which didn't last - it was too thin
  and got badly bent early on</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">My daughter had a 12 Dancing Princess

  <Text category="toys_games">My son received these when he was 7
  months old and we are loving them! They're adorable and chunky

  <Text category="toys_games">We are huge Blues Clues fans and this

  <Text category="toys_games">This little toy is cute. My 11 month

  (1) HOUR. MY ONLY COMPLAINT IS THE MATERIAL. YOU CAN PROBABLY
  GUESS THIS PUNCTURED ALMOST IMMEDIATELY. I MADE SURE TO CLEAR
  DEBRIS BEFOREHAND AND IT SEEMS SOMETHING VERY SMALL WOUNDED THIS
  TOY. I'VE REFILLED IT BUT I'M A LITTLE APPREHENSIVE ON WHERE TO
  LET MY KIDS USE THIS. IT SEEMS THAT IT TAKES VERY LITTLE TO

  <Text category="toys_games">This is my favorite game of all time.
  This is the kind of game my family and i love to play at our
  beach house every morning. It's a great family game. Really for
  no one over mabye seven. I recomend this to any family who loves
  a great game to play with the whole family</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">My son received this toy for his
  first birthday! I will be purchasing it as gifts for all my
  friends!! He LOVES pushing the button and listening the the
  music. I was wondering if he would be able to figure out the
  gears, but he has caught on very quickly and loves to take the
  gears off and put them back on. He also enjoys stacking the gears
  up and watching them go around! I like that it has a handle so he
  can carry it around with him. It keeps him involved for up to 20
  minutes at a time! It is very durable as he carries it around,
  has chewed on the gears (which are made of strong plastic and
  cannot be marred by chewing on them). My three year old also
  likes to play with it! Her play is a little sofisticated with it
  as she tries to figure out which gears have to be put where (as
  in, do they have to be next to the middle spinning one) placed to
  make them spin and how many can be stacked and they still turn.
  My one wish is that Playskool would include a few extra gears. We
  have them everyhwere in our house and cannot always find them
  all. It would be great if they had a place where you could
  purchase extra ones for replacements and/or to have extras for
  stacking. This is an awesome toy that the kids love, can learn
  from, and is very durable! It is a must have!</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">My one year old has had this toy for
  about 4 months now and it's still his favorite toy. There is no
  end to the amount of fun my child has with this toy and he keeps
  coming up with new ways to play with it. It's hours of endless
  entertainment!</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">We've had one in the house for a few
  years now. The kids (5 and 2-1/2) love it. It's soft, cuddly, and
  sized just right for them. It's been taken all over the place,
  has provided companionship for them on many a long trip
  (including two to South Korea), given comfort when they are sad,
  and been used for countless hours of make-believe. Its worth has
  been far more than what was paid for it</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">A great way to save kids artwork. I
  use the pockets to organize by grade - it is great</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">When I ironed my 14M son wanted to
  play with it. He helps with the house cleaning. I bought this toy
  iron that really has an on and off switch, sprays water and
  pretend buttons. He loves it and pushes it around the carpet like
  he is ironing the carpet. We "play" iron with the water when I
  have time. This is one toy that I can take anywhere and he stays
  busy for quite some time. Sigrid Manon Blake - Ramire</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">This is one of the few toys, it
  seems, which has remained fundamentally unchanged since we were
  children. The push-stick is shaped a little differently (I
  remember a thin blue broom stick with an orange or red handle)
  but otherwise, it is the same. No electronic sounds or flashing
  lights have been added - although you can get it that way, too,
  if you want. Personally I think these things detract from the
  imagination building aspects of certain toys. I'm not saying we
  have no talking or musical or flashing toys, but it dismays me
  when these things are added to the classics (think Little People
  farm etc). What I love about this toy is it can be ANYTHING. It's
  a sweeper! It's a carpet cleaner! It's a mop! It never fails to
  crack me up when my son comes running after me with his corn
  popper when I am cleaning. It's a lawnmower! So many jobs around
  the house or yard can be copied with the corn popper. And if mom
  or dad isn't up to much, it's still great fun to run around with
  which means exercise for the kiddies. It's a solo toy and a
  playing-with-other-kids toy. Any time we have other children over
  to play, the corn popper comes out as they chase each other about
  the house. We got this toy when my son was 13 months. He is now
  3y4m and still playing with this toy. I have seen 5 and 6 year
  olds still playing with the corn popper. There are few toys that
  are so simple and yet offer so much fun. Sturdy, too - very
  important as it's bound to be crashed into a few walls. I can't
  think of another toy which will give you more bang for your buck
  - unless you count dirt and measuring spoons and all those other
  free things that kids so exasperatingly pick over the toys you
  paid good money for. I am a little alarmed at the current PRICE
  listed for this toy, though. You should not need to pay that much
  for it. Occasionally this item becomes hard to find - especially
  at Christmas - but usually there are tons of them in the stores
  for around the cost of a President Hamilton. Right now this is
  listed for twice that.</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">This toy is the coolest toy I've ever
  used! When I have slumber parties I always play music, and my
  friends always say that I have the coolest boombox. Some of them
  are even thinking about buying one. I love listening to music on
  my brand new bratz lips boombox. And this year at my birthday
  slumber party, I'm gonna play music all night. This toy is just
  so cool!!!!!!!!</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">My daughters love this supermarket

  <Text category="toys_games">Bought this game at Books a Million
  in North Carolina for a mere $10+tax. A very good deal! Although
  I don't keep up on a lot of contemporary literature, I was able
  to do pretty well. Within three hours I had all but one pie. One
  of the teammates did as well. The third of us wasn't as lucky,
  but it was a fun game nonetheless. As with all board games, the
  fun is in the company, not knowing all the answers. The questions
  were good, and yes - tough - but they were tough for all of us,
  not slanted towards one particular audience. I would have given
  this 5 stars except that there really do need to be more question
  cards. But for $10, three adults had three hours of intelligent
  entertainment (we went through half of the cards). We got our
  money's worth</Text>

  probably find this game extremely difficult. On the other hand,
  you now have a book list</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">We live in Alaska and really wanted
  two of these games to pass on to our married daughters since it
  has been a holiday tradition to play. We found them for purchase
  on Amazon but were displeased at the cost to ship to Alaska.
  Although we are part of the US and USPS ships for a reasonable
  price, we weren't given that option and paid at least double what
  it could have been. UPS and FedEx rip off those of us in Alaska
  while USPS treats us just like everybody in the Lower-48. Give us
  a USPS option</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">We purchased the item hoping that it
  would be of reasonable size, meaning the food would be closer to
  "real" size rather than miniature. It was. We also hoped it would
  be made well and stand up to hopefully more than one generation
  of use. That remains to be seen, but the stuff is made well and I
  cannot see it breaking unless you deep-freeze the plastic pieces
  and hit them with a hammer. Nice texture, nice flexibility,
  pretty realistic looks. The child it was intended for (age 4 and
  a bit) plays happily with it, even the older boys (10 and 13)
  have had a few moments of goofy fun with it</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">I have two boys, 10 and 12. The
  younger one bought a webkinz first and after seeing how much fun
  he had at the website, the older one asked for one for his
  birthday. The website is very kid friendly. You won't have to
  worry about what they will see on this website. It is great fun,
  and even I play on it! I highly recommend this for any age
  child</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">I purchased this expansion set, along
  with the Thomas and Friends Water Towr Figure 8 Set, for my 2
  year old this past Christmas. The expansion set was an
  afterthought, prompted in no small part by the manufacturer's
  promotion running at the time (50% off this set with the purchase
  of a Figure 8 set). With the conclusion of many initial hours of
  intense playtesting (an ongoing process, with no termination in
  sight), my son agrees that this is an essential choice for any
  but the most basic (read: boring) wooden railroad layout. This
  expansion pack comes with switch tracks, and allows little train
  engineers (and their dads) to reverse directions or explore
  different parts of the railway. In retrospect, I think that I
  would have been dissatisfied had I not purchased this set to
  complement the basic Figure 8 layout, promotional price or not.
  As far as the quality, the Learning Curve wooden track is made
  from hardwood, and is more substantial than many other brands of
  compatible track (i.e. Maxim, First Learning, etc.). This is a
  consideration when your child insists on taking the track apart
  by him/herself to put away. We have already broken a couple of
  pieces of generic track this way, since the male end of the
  connectors is a bit weaker than the rest of the track. Overall,
  we are quite satisfied with this set, and look forward to many
  more hours of enjoyment</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">Wow! This is an excellent deck that
  lets you automatically get the Harpie Lady Cards, and as well as
  a monster card based on one of the characters from Legend Of The
  Mystical Ninja</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">But I like Sasha and Jade better.
  She's cute though. She has brown hair with blond highlights and
  big hazel eyes and her beauty mark looks so cute! Her first
  outfit is a pink tank top with a silver necklace design. Her
  skirt is a strange black, pink, and gold pattern. Her shoes are
  pink with small gold hearts and a yellow "stone" in the middle.
  Her second outfit is a black tank top with a silver chandelier
  design. Her jeans are light blue with flower designs and a silver
  and hot pink fringe over it. Her shoes are black mary janes with
  red designs on them. Thanks for reading my review! Hope you enjoy
  her</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">Our son plays with this board while
  I'm feeding him. He's only 20 months, but using this board is
  helping us introduce the numbers to him. It's well built. Arrived
  in only a couple days. Our son loves it!</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">We bought this set for my seven year
  old boy and we were a bit dissapointed. There are better magic
  kits out there for the price for older children. (Look at the
  Marshal Broden Kits by Cadaco). If you have a young child is is
  four and five though this is a great set. The tricks are easy to
  work and they are big for small hands. Anyone who has any magic
  sets or tricks though will find this too simplistic and not as
  exciting as many of the other kits.</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">My 3 year old opened this for
  Christmas and loved it. Who would have guessed that this little
  car would have been a bigger hit than a lot of the more expensive
  things he was given! It doesn't get stuck on any surface that
  we've tried it on and drives right over things in its path, which
  my son thinks is REALLY COOL! Great toy for a relatively
  inexpensive price</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">No bells, no whistles -- Just an
  action figure with its' own four-wheeler. It can capture the mind
  of a car-obsessed 6 year old boy for an hour at a time at least
  :-) Some of the objects that the action figure is supposed to
  hold don't stay in his hand very well, but oh well -- it seems
  that all my nephew wanted to do was crach the thing anyway! And
  it takes that quite well.</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">My son received this one as well as
  the other colorfelt toy. He was not impressed with it in regards
  to playing with it on his own. It does work well for teaching and
  using it as a toy that we can play together.</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">I was very pleased with the order and
  the speed at which it was delivered. More important, my grandson
  loves it. It was what he wanted and could not find it here so was
  very glad for AMAZON</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">More track is the first thing you're
  going to want to buy after your first GeoTrax train set. It will
  seem like you never have enough straights and curves to bring the
  track design to reality. The "switched" pieces work out better as
  the child gets older (3-4+)</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">I THINK THE HAIR MAY BE A BIT OVER

  THREE-QUARTER STARS. (IT WOULD BE FIVE IF THE HAIR WERE BETTER.)
  SHE'S STILL A GREAT DOLL THOUGH. NEARLY PERFECT!!!!!</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">I love this doll but the only
  complaint i have is the eyes why are they looking to the right !
  Mattel please if your gona make more then please put the pupul in
  the middle. Pleeeeeeeeas</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">Easy to follow instructions for
  set-up and play, very intuitive. The only thing I would suggest
  is to make sure the young folks have an 'elder' playing on their
  team, to have a shot at the questions on old people, events, etc.
  If they're real sports history buffs, then it's not an
  issue</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">Love it! The questions are
  great...the "party mode" is great entertainment</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">My son calls this a flute, and rather
  than argue, we let it go. But his little hands have a hard time
  holding it. (He's 4). Even I have trouble. I'm right-handed and
  the right-hand keys are on the bottom. I don't know if that's how
  real clarinets are, but it's awkward. Also, your whole mouth has
  to be covering the entire mouthpiece in order to make it play, so
  that's also a little frustrating. But the sound is great and it's
  fun to play once you get the hang of it</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">This toy is awsome !I Truly recomend
  this to you and all your friends!!!</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">We purchased this for our 5 year old
  along with the spy goggles. He immensely enjoyed both. As a
  matter of fact, the adults were quite taken with it too</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">Nursing Nana is a great gift. It is
  soft and cuddly, and the puppies attach with magnets, giving a
  realistic nursing "tug" as you attach and detach them. This would
  be a great gift for a child when a second or third child is being
  born to take the angst out of mom nursing the new baby. It is a
  bit smaller than I anticipated, but it is still worth it because
  it is well-made</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">I am in my twenties...I had one of
  these dogs when i was little and i loved it. It shows kids the
  way dogs naturally feed their puppies. Of course it is only a
  stuffed animal so it is not going to do anything. But in my
  opinion it is a very cute toy for a dog love</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">This is a beuatiful dining set. True,
  it doesn't come with the pony as it clearly states in the product
  description, but we have too many already. Anyway, I would
  recommend it for the crystal princess castle or you can even use
  this with other doll houses</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">I keep this on my desk at my office,
  people love it, and it a lot of fun to watch them during the day.
  I highly recommend</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">I bought the Sea Monkeys on Mars for

  <Text category="toys_games">Webkinz Hippo arrived in an
  exceptable time frame and in good condition. I will definitely
  order others</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">This concept is very interesting and
  new fangled (at least to me) as far as plush animals. The
  interactive/internet/game aspect is very clever and provides a
  lot of fun for kiddos. I got this for my nephew and he likes it.
  It keeps him entertained. One thing--they just don't make stuffed
  animals the way they used to as far as quality. Justin is not
  rough with his toys, and this hippo has already lost some of his
  hair. I wish we could find good quality plush anymore. I hate the
  idea of disposable toys because I grew up with tonka toys and
  teddybears that I still have. I still have my Raggedy Ann and
  Andy dolls from about twenty-five years ago, and they have never
  lost hair. So buy the hippo for fun, but don't expect him to
  survive</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">this was a super soft animal and one

  <Text category="toys_games">A retooled mold brings this 60s
  sci-fi kit back to the hands of today's kit builders! Not QUITE
  accurate to the sets &amp;amp; miniatures of the original show...
  the passenger compartment should have 2 more seats, the control
  yokes are not included with the pilot's console, plus the top
  dome is round instead of teardrop-shaped... but these are all
  true to the original Aurora model. Wouldn't take much to fix the
  mistakes, as there are plenty of references &amp;amp; replacement
  decal sheets out there... or just build it "as is" for nostalgia
  value</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">I started playing this game in it's
  original German version. Which, went through some revision as the
  expansion decks were put out. As a result, the english version
  may end up being a little more together as you get the expansion
  decks. Talk about a wonderful game to play for two people! It is
  absolutely well put together, though certainly different in
  playing than the boardgame version of Catan. It uses the same
  notions, but has a far more dynamic involvement within the game
  play itself. The expansion packs are absolutely great, and
  overall add lots of options and twists to the play of the game.
  IT takes a couple of hours, and a signicant amount of table
  space. It travels well enough in it's box, but to actually play
  it you need time and lots of space. I highly recommend it,
  especially if you are only two people and looking for a game that
  you can play that is fun, involving, and certainly full of
  strategy. This is one of the many wonderful games made by Klaus
  Teuber, and I hope he keeps coming up with winners</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">This is a great game for two players
  (and two players only). The first one or two times I played, it
  was very, very slowgoing because there is a lot to take in.
  However, once you adapt to the numerous cards and they become
  familiar to you, games tend to take about an hour. It's a fairly
  involved game, so you have to be in the mood for that. There's a
  lot of strategy and many ways to win. I greatly recommend it for
  those who already enjoy playing games. It might be daunting for a
  really casual gamer, though. If you like it, there are now
  expansion sets available that add lots of spice and variety to
  the original</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">I bought this for my niece and it
  arrived within a few days in great condition. It was still in its
  original box and it wasn't dented or anything.</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">Lots of fun for young children. My
  kids ages 2, 4 and 7 all enjoy building creatures with this set.
  The only negative is that there aren't very many pieces. If more
  than one child wants to play at a time you will need more
  sets</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">Of all the toys our son has gotten,
  this one has stood the test of time. For over 2 years he has
  consistently sought out this train to play with. It has survived
  being dropped on almost a daily basis and still keeps going.
  Highly reccommend</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">I stumbled upon this game years ago,
  and my family has enjoyed it--even my adult friends, who seemed
  to balk at first at playing a kids' game. This past year, I
  decided to purchase it for my sixth grade classroom. I must
  say...WOW. I allowed the kids to play it for a while during
  homeroom, and kids would be waiting early outside the room to get
  in and snag the Frog Juice. They would even play it over other
  outdoor games at recess. Anytime you heard a "NOOOO!" in the
  room, you knew someone had pulled out the Witch Wash. The kids
  LOVED it. So, I have come back to purchase a new deck for this
  upcoming year. To any educators who might be reading this, it
  makes a great addition to the intermediate classroom for those
  few minutes of downtime, and because of the math and bit of
  strategy involved, you don't feel guilty about it at all. Plus,
  it is something different and for the teacher, inexpensive as far
  as games go</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">This is a veary FUN baseball game, I
  first played it at my summer camp and it was so fun, I got it for
  Myself!!!!!</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">A great game for the whole family. My
  visiting Swedish friend enjoyed playing so much that she bought
  one to bring back home with her. If you like Sequence you will
  have fun with Kings in the Corner</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">Our family played this game a lot
  during the 60's. We had a blast with it. I didn't think much
  about it until this year when my son turned 6. It's a blast for
  family fun</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">This was my first Schleich World of
  Knights figure, given to me Christmas of this year. It's a highly
  detailed classic dragon, with no moving or detachable parts (the
  wings are an integral part of the figure). As such, it's safe for
  very young children, and you don't have to worry about someone's
  eye getting put out. As to its historical accuracy and
  educational value, I really cannot say, never having seen Dragons
  in the wild, but the level of detail is wonderful, and it should
  encourage children to obtain the more "practical" members of the
  balance of Scheich World of Knights collection, which are
  excellent, as well</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">I recently purchased this game using
  a gift certificate. My little boy LOVES it. I think it's quite
  interesting as well but there were several typos on the game
  cards. Frankly, there needs to be better proof reading. Was this
  game assembled and printed in another country other than the USA.
  That would probably account for it</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">We had looked a lot of places for
  jack in the boxes and were pleased to find this unusual one. My
  girls love horses so it was a pretty easy decision to make. The
  music is great and it is easy to operate for both of them ( ages
  20 months and 3 1/2 )</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">It takes a few hands to learn all the
  tricks to this game, but once learned, it is a lot of fun. A good
  game for four players, and a great game for six players. It
  generates lots of lively action, with the bidding for the cards.
  We played this game on a cruise with four strangers. They were no
  longer strangers, after the game. Everyone we have played with
  say they are going to buy it. That's how we got it. Bought the
  game after playing with family.</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">This figure is one of the best in the
  marvel legends series. I have over forty of the marvel legends
  figures and this is the tallest. The hair on his body looks real
  and his joints aren't to tight, but not to lose either their just
  right. I couldn't wait for them to release more Exiles members
  like Noctourne, Blink, Morph, &amp;amp; Mimic. I wasn't very
  happy to see the marvel legends series coming to an end with the
  seperation of marvel from Toy Biz the last series are going to be
  realeased later this year. I'm glad to see Psylocke &amp;amp;
  Falcon before the series end, but what about the wildly popular
  She Hulk. They've got the loser Sabertooth from the Exiles coming
  out, but not She Hulk. If you're going to bring an Exiles to the
  series at least bring characters we like. NOCTOURNE, MORPH,
  BLINK, MIMIC!!!!</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">We purchased this game for our son
  for Christmas. He is a chess lover, and we wanted to get him
  something a little different. Chaturanga was perfect, since it is
  the precursor to chess. He has enjoyed the game. All of us were
  impressed with the bookshelf edition. It is an attractive box. We
  are very pleased with every aspect of it</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">Chaturanga is the oldest known form
  of chess. It dates back to India in the seventh century A.D.
  Front Porch classics has carefully re-created this game and it is
  now available to everyone! The game itself is beautiful. It is
  played on a fabric playing board (all games were once played on
  fabric, it's extremely portable and cheap, and cardboard wasn't
  even invented until the late 1800's!). Unlike chess, the game can
  be played with two to four players. Each player gets 8 playing
  pieces, made of clay: A Raja, an elephant, a horse (cavalry), a
  ship and four infantrymen. These pieces are kept in beautiful
  velvet bags. Each piece does have a loose equivalent in modern
  chess. The Raja is the most important piece, much like the king.
  The elephant acts much like the rook. The ship is the bishop, and
  you cannot capture a Raja with the ship. The Cavalry moves
  exactly like a knight. The infantry, which in this game look kind
  of like tiny Buddhas in lotus position, are like the pawns. The
  big difference between Chaturanga and chess is that Chaturanga is
  played with a four-sided die (it's a long rectangle, instead of a
  perfectly square cube). The die tells you which piece you have to
  move. The game is somewhat easier to learn than chess, but easily
  as much fun. The game can and should be used by teachers and
  parents to introduce their children to the history and culture of
  India. The rulebook includes lots of interesting information
  about India as well as about the history of the game. The game
  comes in a convenient Bookshelf Edition, where the game is kept
  in a beautiful book-shaped box that looks great on any bookshelf
  or coffee table</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">We bought this for our daughter's
  first birthday. She was immediately interested and so was her
  three-year-old brother. In addition, her five cousins (ages 5-16)
  and their father (36)were also captivated. There are eleven gears
  in five colors that spin when the button is pushed. Initially,
  she loved to take the gears off and teeth on them. She is
  fourteen months now and puts them back on. She presses the button
  to watch them spin. She has taken it to the sitter's and the kids
  there have played with it all day. When we take it to the
  sitter's, I put it in a bag because the gears do not stay on when
  the toy is vertical. So far,it appears to be a toy that will grow
  with her as she and her brother play with it differently. We
  rotate toys, but I leave this one out continuously and I often
  find her playing with it quietly by herself. I have given it five
  stars because it offers a variety of ways to play (the gears can
  even be stacked), is different from all other toys they have,
  appeals to a wide range of ages, grows with the child, does not
  use up batteries (we are still on the first set), and seems very
  durable. I recommend this toy</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">This game is a great way to pass
  twenty to thirty minutes. It is very easy to learn and does not
  have any pieces to lose, or money to count. The strategies,
  however, are numerous, and there is an equal amount of luck as
  skill involved in good gameplay. I really liked how the game
  could ONLY be played with two people, as I was tired of games
  that COULD be played with two, but which were really meant to be
  enjoyed by three or more... Game Contents: 1 deck of game cards,
  and one small board. Note: If you want to make this game really
  portable you don't even need to bring the board. It is just a
  place to put discarded cards and a way to help organize your
  cards. As long as you have a pencil and paper for scoring at the
  end of the game, you can play it everywhere that you have a
  table. (I figure you need as much space to lay down your cards as
  the size of a typical Monopoly board). Playing Note: One thing
  that was initially a little confusing to us when we were reading
  the instructions, was that the instructions do not explain that
  you are to place your cards on the opposite side of the board as
  your opponent. You can each play all 5 expeditions, in a head to
  head manner. We were sitting on a couch at a coffee table, and we
  had turned the board horizontally to face us (instead of
  vertically) and the instructions were confusing until we moved
  the board 90 degrees. The game designers assumed that you would
  play the game as one would play a game of checkers, sitting
  across from one another, but you don't actually have to play this
  way, even though you DO need to turn your board for the same
  effect. This game is really fun and I would highly recommend
  other games from the same manufacturer (Rio Grande Games). They
  really have a knack for publishing great strategy games. They
  even release expansion sets to their popular games, and they
  credit the players who gave them the ideas for the expansion
  cards. Pretty neat</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">This is the first game I've tried by
  the venerable Reiner Knizia. I was really taken in by the
  combination of simple rules, but interesting strategy. Since
  then, I've purchased several of his games. For those who like
  Lost Cities, but also have a soft spot for Poker, try Battleline.
  Samurai is a great introduction to the sometimes complicated
  world of "tile games", with Tigres and Euphrates being the much
  more complicated cousin (although again, the rules aren't that
  complicated...the difficulty comes via strategic decision
  making.) So far, my all time favorite Knizia game...and frankly,
  one of my favorite games period, is Modern Art. The game
  mechanics are fairly simple, easily explained in 5 minutes, with
  some of the more complex bidding rules explained in a trial game.
  Essentially, it's a game about playing an auction...who is the
  best at playing the market, guessing at art values, and spending
  money wisely. It's also a true crossover game... non-gamers, or
  those only exposed to the standard Monopoly, Trivial Pursuit,
  etc, will quickly learn how much fun it can be... and will
  probably be asking to play again</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">Lost Cities is a really fun game, and
  very addictive. I've personally played over 200 matches already
  on the free online version available at http://www.flexgames.com/
  Check it out and play against some really good players across the
  globe and get a feel for the game itself before buying. I've had
  my name in the notification list for this game on amazon.com for
  some time now, so I'll definitely be purchasing it right
  away</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">Vakama is very cool.You must get
  him!He wears the Great Mask of Concelment and comes with a kanoka
  disk</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">Hello, My name is Cloe. Yes, because
  I love Bratz so much I changed my name from Matisyahu to Cloe. I
  love this doll. IT BEATS BARBIE AND KEN BY A MILE. Speaking of
  Barbie I also reccommend the singer AQUA she sings " I'm a Barbie
  Girl." Buy Cloe and the others while you can!!! It's worth it and
  it will be a decision you will NEVER in your whole entire life,
  however long that may be, regret</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">The girls liked this doll. The wings
  are velcro so they can make her into a princess or play with her
  as an angel- they like that. Great buy from Amazon</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">I wish I had one of these when I was
  a kid. The canopy tops this stand, it rotates to block the sun.
  Every passerby will know what's for sale. We even use it inside
  for play. It's a well made toy and I would purchase more products
  from this company</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">My two year old boy absolutely loves
  these puzzles. They're soft but sturdy and are more challenging
  than peg puzzles. It's a great puzzle for kids that can do more
  than peg puzzles but aren't ready for the regular 10 piece
  interlocking puzzles. There's a base template for each puzzle to
  help put it together or you can remove it for a bigger challenge.
  The only downside are some of the very small pieces...definitely
  need parental supervision for kids under 3</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">Well, this is the expansion for
  Settlers of Catan, and a lot of things have changed. The ability
  to build military forces adds depth to the game, as does the city
  improvements. The abundance of new cards is worth it if for the
  beautiful illustrations alone. The expansion makes the game a
  little bit longer to play, but it still should finish out well
  inside two and a half hours. My only complaint is that in several
  games, the Barbarians have not beaten us once, they are way too
  easy. However, this is minor and can be remedied with a house
  rule of your own. All in all, this makes a great game TOTALLY
  AWESOME</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">Maybe it's my computer or browser,
  but the picture here doesn't do this doll justice. I bought one
  at my local drug store before I saw it here at Amazon. I can tell
  you that this Beach Glam Barbie is gorgeous! The picture here
  looks faded to me, but I have the doll right here in front of me,
  and the pink accessories are a lovely perfect shade of vivid
  pink, not pale or washed out as it appears to be in this
  photo.</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">This toy is pretty stellar. I mean,
  you can play battleship anytime you want w/o having to ask
  someone else to play with you. It is awesome for long trips or
  just something to do if your bored</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">My girls were given this game a
  couple years ago. . .ages 2 and 3. They crack up over the voices
  and play it still. I like it also b/c it's so darn cute</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">This is a great Barney musical
  songbook, and can also be used as a play piano. It's great that
  it has an auto turn off, after non-use. However, if it is turned
  off, and something touches it, it automatically turns on by
  itself. Many times, after the kids went to bed, and we happen to
  put something on top of the Barney Sing 'n Play Songbook, it
  turns on by itself. Because the Songbook does not have a physical
  turn off switch, and something touches it, Barney will start
  talking in the silent room when the kids are asleep. Just wish it
  has an on/off switch, so it will not be turned on accidentally.
  Otherwise, my 3 year old loves it</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">My son got this toy for his birthday
  about a year ago, when he was two. It was one of the gifts we let
  him pick out on his own. He loved it and played with nothing else
  for a week! The songs are cute and familiar to him, plus Barney
  talks and sings to the music. The only draw backs were that I
  couldn't find an off button and that it is $20+ at local
  retailers. I wish the toys companies would cut us parents a
  little slack. LOL</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">This Schleich Haflinger is a good
  buy. Schleich is as detailed as Breyer, and are as big as Breyer
  Paddock Pals. This Haflinger stallion is a palomino, with a
  shaggy mane and tail. This horse is full of personality, and is
  well worth the money. Your kid will love this model horse.</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">I don't agree with the other review
  this doll is great to play with. She has such a pretty dress and
  vail. Her hair is very long and it get tangled pretty easy but if
  your good with barbie hair its not a problem. I would suggest
  that you buy the groom at the same time take it from me I still
  really want him. The barbie with blond hair is also very
  pretty</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">I love anything Barbie, anything
  pink, and anything that supports the Susan G Komen Foundation.
  This doll is all of those wrapped up in one neat package. I am
  thinking about giving them to my female relatives for
  Christmas</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">My little granddaughters loved
  receiving this. Especially after they figured out the sandbox
  works best when not dumped on each others heads and the
  lawn</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">We have had this sandbox for five
  years. It has been durable and my two kids ages 3 and 5 just love
  it. Color of the plastic is still bright and has been under sun
  for years. Sometimes water seeps in when it rains but this makes
  sand play even funner for kids. We tend to put a rock on top of
  lid to keep it in place though it does cover the box perfectly.
  It is also nice that the lid is attached to the box itself and is
  easy for kids to remove and put back on when done. The kids
  usually sit outside of it though it can accomodate 1-2 small kids
  inside it as well. I find most kids dont want to get sand all
  over and end up sitting outside of it regardless. Overall good
  investment and the kids love it</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">I noticed that this ladybug sand box
  only had 3&amp;amp;amp;1/2 stars and the others all had 5. I felt
  a need to speak up. We bought this sandbox for our first son when
  he was three. We lived in an apartment with a small back patio.
  It was perfect, not too big but still room for a toddler or two
  to sit in it and play. He played for hours!! Now 5 years later,
  his little brother loves it and my first son, almost 9, still
  plays with the little one in it. It still looks brand new,
  nestled under the tree in our big back yard. It's really great
  just smaller than the others. We have since given this for every
  two year old birthday present we've bought! I highly recommend
  it</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">I give this toy low marks for
  educational value for two reasons: first, humans were not
  contemporary to the brontosaurus, and second, the egg is too big
  to have been laid by the adult dinosaur included in the set. My
  mother sent this toy as a gift for my son's first birthday. The
  package suggests this toy for ages 2-5, and in typical fashion,
  my son found the box to be just as interesting as the toy itself,
  but my three-year-old daughter was immediately and completely
  enchanted with the toy. She began role-playing with the dinosaurs
  right away. "I love you very much," said the mama dinosaur to her
  baby. Supercute</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">No hiking dad would be complete
  without a Kelty kid carrier. We have taken ours everywhere. From
  Disneyworld to the Redwoods. They distribute the weight to your
  hips making it much easier to carry a child where ever you want
  to go</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">She is so cute! I love the real hair,
  I've made loads of crazy designs. Also, I made a discovery, if
  you squeeze her tummy, she cries, falls asleep or says "I luv you
  mama"</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">This chart has been an excellent way
  for our children to track their daily progress towards completing
  their weekly chores and an excellent way to begin the work for
  allowance process. Only draw back there really isn't enough room
  to track chores for more than one child</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">This is a GREAT way to get your
  child(ren) to do the things that need to be done around the
  house. I purchased two, one for each of my older children and
  they love that they have control over keeping up with the board.
  It is easy for them to use and easy for you to keep track of
  their progress.</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">Got this as a fun birthday present
  for my husband who adores anything Star Wars. He liked it so much
  he brought it to work and we now occassionally hear stories about
  Darth Potato and the Spud Troopers waging war on unsuspecting
  engineers. It's a GREAT Geek toy</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">I just bought this yesterday and
  surprised my girls (3 and 5) with it today. It does blow tons of
  bubbles! They love chasing them all over the yard. The Gazillion
  bubble solution that comes with it is cool because the bubbles
  are really colorful when they come out. It does used 8 AA
  batteries as previously mentioned but there is an order from
  inside to send away for an adaptor. Yes, it has a plug for an
  adaptor to plug it in so you don't use so many batteries. Where
  I'll plug it in in the backyard I'm not sure yet. I definitely
  recommend for the young children that are so excited by
  bubbles</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">My son loves the Imaginext dino
  collection. He has almost all of them. They're durable, fun and
  educational</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">This thing is great. Our 4 year old
  loves it. The working drawbridge, breakaway wall for cannon fire
  and trap door are great. Considering the size and number of
  pieces, it was remarkably easy to put together. Allow 2 to 3
  hours for assembly, but the directions are excellent. Only
  complaint is that some of the small pieces that don't always want
  to stay together - some of the "details" will likely be missing
  after a few weeks. Overall, very happy with it</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">My son received this toy as a present
  from his father on Christmas (Dec '05) and he was able to play
  with it straight out of the box. I bought my son the V Smile
  system and he can't use that as easily as he uses the read with
  me system. While a agree with some of the previous reviews that
  this system would not take him to seven years old, it does build
  his confidence level and keeps him motivated to keep playing
  because he was getting the answers right. While with the V smile
  system he prefers I play and he watch. So I am happy with this
  purchase and will buy more DVDs for the system. I have only one
  complaint and that is I wish they would use both traditional
  stories and use some of the newer characters. My son loves Thomas
  the train and even though he has the little engine that could I
  think he would also like to see Thomas the Tank Engine, Dora the
  Explorer, and maybe even some books in foreign languages. But all
  in all a great system for the younger preschool children.</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">I was skeptical at first and I am so
  happy that I got this for my kids. I homeschool my children and
  needed something to keep one of the kids busy while I was working
  with another. This is easy to use, fun to play and I like the
  stories that are available. I think you get a great product for a
  great price</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">I gave this game to my 13 year old
  nephew for Christmas. He actually wrote me a thank you note for
  it. In the note he said "I like it better than normal Monoply.
  There's a lot more thinking and strategy involved". I might even
  go up to five stars</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">I recently bought this toy for my 2.5
  year old daughter. She likes it and plays with it everyday. All
  the parts assembled easily - I didn't even use the directions. I
  have not had any trouble with parts falling off or breaking. It's
  great to use an outside toy</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">This is a must-have item if you want
  to add the Clock Tower to your set. It also works well with the
  other "elevation" sets, particularly Mile High Mountain. The set
  includes the following: 4 ramps (these are made from two shorter
  pieces that are screwed together) 2 curves 2 short straights 2
  guard rails 2 end ramps 8 arches (2 supports and 1 crosspiece
  each) The crosspieces of the arches have a picture of how the
  ends of the track should be aligned. The screws are a little
  tough but never need to be removed. The set is enough to run up
  two full levels and back down again (my son has played with this
  set just by itself having fun running up, around and racing back
  down). You can also make two single-level bridges, a single level
  bridge and a ramp down from Mile High Mountain, or many other
  setups. This set literally adds a new dimension to a Geotrax set.
  Lots of fun. The short pieces also allow for different
  configurations that may have been frustrating in the past.
  Definitely fun.</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">There are so many great things about
  this that I don't know where to start.
  Availability--price--shipping--the list goes on and on. Bottom
  line is that my daughter is a big Care Bear fan and it's
  impossible to find this bear anywhere else. It arrived quickly,
  was just as described (in fact it was softer) and occupies a
  place of honor on my daughter's bed. I give it a 5, only because
  that's the highest. Makes a wonderful gift!!</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">This track set is ok but it's not
  that thrilling. We ended up buying more track and other stops.
  Over all the train is great.</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">What a wonderful toy. The no volume
  control worried me, but it isn't that loud. Great value,Great
  toy</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">We got this for my daughter for
  Christmas and she just loves it. The music is a little loud but
  she highly enjoys it</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">My little girl loves her, and she
  always has Magenta with her when she's watching Blues Clues. Only
  thing is she is a beanie baby so she's small.</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">This doll looks like it will be a
  collectible in a few years. The Lucy in Paris Barbie is already
  worth more than double what it was selling for a few years ago.
  This doll will probably go up in value as well. In regards to the
  person who returned this doll twice for a slightly dented
  box...GET A LIFE! Who in the hell would return a doll just
  because the box had a dent! If the doll wasn't damaged why are
  you returning it???? It's life, nothing's perfect, GET OVER IT!
  You can't expect perfection...as long as the item itself isn't
  damaged there's no reason to make a big fuss over the cardboard
  box it comes in! This is a nice doll (even if the box is dented)
  and I would recommend purchasing it. I ordered this doll and the
  box mine came in was in good shape (to me anyway). As far as I
  know, buyers on ebay aren't extremely picky on the condition of
  the box...they are more concerned on the condition of the doll
  and whether or not it is still in the box.</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">I like that everything fits in the
  case. My 2 year old enjoys dumping all the pieces on the floor.
  No big deal. You can also store a few parts in the potato and
  take it with you. Very happy with purchase</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">This is sooooo cool the fashons DO

  <Text category="toys_games">I'm not sure why so many of these
  (all?) reviews are for a different product, but this one is
  actually for the balancing bike. We got this for our son for
  Christmas and he loves it. He just turned 5 and has a bike with
  training wheels but it's still too big for him. I don't really
  like the idea of training wheels anyway so I started looking for
  something like this balancing bike. I saw a German one for $350
  so I was thrilled to find this one for under $100. It was so easy
  to assemble. I love that the seat height adjusts. My son rides it
  around the house and after just a few tries was able to coast
  down the hall on it with his feet off the floor. I think it's a
  much better way to learn to ride a bike. The quality is good, the
  seat has a bit of padding, and I expect it will hold up well for
  my other child when she's old enough to ride it in a couple more
  years. I gave it four stars instead of five because it's put
  together with screws, it's not fine craftsmanship. Best buy in
  its category though</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">I loved this trike! It was given to
  my son for his first birthday and he loved it. Daycare was in
  walking distance (I lived in the city) and I used the trike to
  take him. My son loved to hold onto the handle bars, it gave him
  a sence of freedom from the stroller that he hated. My son is now
  three years old and I am buying a new one for my one year old. I
  understand some people give this product bad reviews but there is
  a 1-800 number that goes with the toy. The brand Radio Flyer is
  well known and the customer service line is very helpful and
  willing to replace parts or defects. This is the only gift that
  was given to my son that I can say "I LOVE" and have had for more
  than just one year! Enjoy</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">We recently purchased this playhouse,
  and discovered that it does not come with the peek-a-boo shutters
  (I don't see the shutters in the photo either although they are
  mentioned in the product description). Our 3year old and 18 month
  old both enjoy it, but I would say it is more fun for the 18
  month old than my 3 year old since there is little to actually
  "do" inside the house. The doorbell makes fun sounds. It is very
  easy to put together</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">even though i dont have this i think
  is the most cutest thing i have ever seen</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">I give this 4 stars, because I like
  it (maybe more than my toddler). When I was in kindergarten or
  1st grade, my little brother, who was 1 or 2 at the time, had the
  original -- the one that just popped, and he loved it. He would
  push it around until the popping drove my father "crazy." This
  one does even more. It pops, counts from 1 to 10, plays music,
  and has flashing lights. I think it's an awesome toy, especially
  for the price. My daughter doesn't play with it every day, but
  when she grabs it, she'll push it around for maybe 10 minutes or
  more (we haven't found a single toy that will occupy her
  attention for longer than that). Sometimes, she'll push it around
  several times a day. It's great for that stage when your toddler
  likes to push or drag things around with them. The popping was
  inconsistent when we first received it, but we took it apart, got
  the gears aligned correctly (through trial &amp;amp; error),
  added more Vaseline to the gears for lubrication, and now it
  pops, counts, plays music, and the lights flash consistently
  every time. If you take this toy apart, be careful not to pull
  out the speaker wires -- we did that, but it was no problem. My
  husband soldered the wires back together</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">I bought this game two weekends ago
  and have had both fun and frustration with it. I'm a Freecell
  junkie and have gone so far as to download a better version (more
  games) than the one that came with my computer. I lost track of
  how many total games I've played over the years since I've used
  several computers, but I play about 10 games a day on average.
  I'm very competitive and love keeping track of my stats.
  Unfortunately, that is the weakness of this version of the game.
  For example, if you get into a position were you can move only
  one card back and forth between two columns and there are no
  other moves, all you can do is hit the replay button or move on
  to another game. If you hit the replay button you don't get a
  loss recorded, which of course you should. Consequently, it is
  easy to run up a high win percentage with this version of the
  game just by resigning a game when you think you are going to
  loose and replay it. Then when you finally win, you get credit
  for a win. Of course, that is not proper scoring either. Also,
  there is a key combination that when you do lose a game outright
  and want to replay, you don't get any further losses counted
  against you. That's as it should be. The only problem is that key
  combination is very flaky and doesn't always work. Other than
  scoring inconsistencies, it's a great game! It's very easy to
  use. Although different to use than playing with a mouse on your
  computer, if you've played a lot on your computer you'll pick up
  the operation of this version almost immediately. The display is
  large and easy to see, and there is a low light level sensor on
  the front that will automatically light the screen when you are
  playing in an area with poor lighting. That is a great feature. I
  love playing this game while sitting in the airport waiting to
  board a plane and on the plane itself while in the air. It's a
  great and challenging way to pass the time away if you like
  playing solitaire. On the next version of this game, I hope they
  will beef up the statistics capabilities of the unit</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">My 3 year old loves this toy. He has
  a lot of the Krypto toys and getting Mechanikat was essential. We
  just got it for Christmas so am not sure of its longevity. It
  does seem to be pretty well made. Also got Snooky Wookems with
  it. Great for fans of the Krypto cartoons</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">Her favorite toy... she loves the
  microphone... keys light up to prompt her to press the keys and
  play a song.... this thing is great</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">This is the third or fourth Quixo
  game we have purchased to give as a gift! We originaly recieved
  ours as a gift about 5 years ago and it has been a favorite ever
  since. Quixo is tic tac toe with pieces that move. You have a
  strategy, then oops, your opponent chages it all with one move.
  It is suitable for anyone from age 8 to adult. We keep ours out
  at all times - a coffee table game. It is very high quality with
  real wooden blocks as playing pieces. Enjoy!</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">We have this product and LOVE it! At
  first we had a problem with the hooves not working. I called the
  number on the box. They were wonderful and sent me new hooves at
  no expense or item return. Then I find it was user error! Santa
  didn't realize there were buttons in the heel of the hoof that
  push down when walking. I called the company back and they told
  me not to worry about the exta hooves they sent. To enjoy. I
  would order from them again</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">This was a Christmas gift, and the
  person loved it. I was so happy I chose this website to purchase
  from!!</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">This is without a doubt the best
  [...] we have spent on a toy for our 7-year-old son, but it isn't
  a toy. It's a highly functional, albeit inexpensive, metal
  detector. We've had it now for 3 years and take it camping, etc.
  It will easily find something as small as a rusty staple, and
  will detect a railroad spike as far as 4 1/4 inches down, very
  good if you consider how small the detection coil is. When
  camping the kids love to find and dig up ancient tent stakes,
  rusty nails, and the occasional coin. Adjusting the sensitivity
  is trivial, just hold it away from any metal, and turn the
  sensitivity knob until the red detector LED just goes out. Other
  reviewer has noted that the three-piece shaft breaks easily,
  which happened on ours, but a little duct tape goes a long way
  and this shouldn't stop you from buying one. If you get one, make
  sure to bury some coins and other treasures in the garden for the
  kids to find. PS It also really works great for locating studs
  and plumbing pipes in walls</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">This is perfect for any stop-motion
  animator. With over 30 posable joints, Thoron is inexpensive
  compared to other figures.Also, Thoron's nemosis,Stendhal, is a
  great figure for animation</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">After three years of dragons who walk
  on all fours, we get a dragon who stands upright. Seems kind of
  strange. Thoron's debut appearance was in the "Fire &amp;amp;
  Ice" Portal Of Fire set. He makes another appearance here in The
  Metal Ages, and he looks a lot meaner here. Perhaps the rigors of
  battle are wearing on him. I bought Stendhal first and was very
  pleased with him. I found Thoron to be somewhat disappointing.
  He's got some great detail, but he's not as articulated as
  Stendhal is. Replacing the standard light-up feature is a dragon
  roar feature. Thoron doesn't light up, but he has a variety of
  growls and roars that are activated by a button on his chest. His
  articulation is pretty decent. His hind legs (which he stands on)
  are stiff and can only move back and forth. But it gets much
  better when we examine his arms and head. His arms can move back
  and forth, and away from his body. The shoulder joint can move in
  two directions. We get two additional points of articulation at
  the elbows and wrists. Thoron's wrists aren't as versatile as
  Stendhal's are (Stendhal's wrists can turn in addition to the
  claw moving back and forth). His neck can move left and right,
  and his head can move in all manner of directions. As always, his
  jaw opens. His tail is flexible for super-posability, as are his
  towering wings. He can also turn at the waist. My complaints with
  Thoron's articulation are twofold. It would've been nicer if his
  hind legs were posable, and it definitely would've been nice if
  his wrists were articulated like Stendhal's are. Thoron is mostly
  dark green with white highlights on his wings, white claws on his
  feet, and silver colored armor. As mentioned, the detail here is
  better than ever, and everything has a realistic look. He comes
  with a removable piece of armor for his head. I think he looks
  better without it, but maybe that's just me. Thoron is one of the
  most charismatic dragons I've seen (it's all in the face and
  eyes). He looks kind of mean and vicious. Stendhal is supposed to
  be the bad guy, and he doesn't look this mean. The original
  Thoron from the Fire &amp;amp; Ice series has a better facial
  expression. This action figure comes almost completely assembled.
  I just had to attach his wings. Also included are some parts for
  building a small tower with decorative blades and flag, and a
  Draigar warrior with shield and weapon. All things considered,
  Thoron isn't quite as nice as Stendhal is. Nevertheless, he gets
  a thumbs up from me. He's a good addition to any dragons
  collection and a fun action figure to play around with</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">My 9 month old son LOVES this toy!
  It's easily his favorite toy. He'll gladly do tummy time hitting
  the piano keys and hitting the dial and characters. He has a
  great time making it go, and will now sit up and scoot the car a
  little. His other toys were good for a couple weeks at best, this
  one he only seems to be enjoying more the longer he plays with
  it. The music is not nearly as loud or as annoying as most toys
  and is actually a little fun. Well worth the purchase
  price</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">This is now on clearance at Target...

  <Text category="toys_games">Pixter is a fantastic learning tool
  for ages 3+. As a parent, I love that many of the learning
  activities are based around drawing and creating so the child is
  not only gaining knowledge but also creating art at the same
  time. My son who will be 2 in a few weeks has a Pixter, and
  though he is far below the age recommendation, he absolutely
  adores drawing with his Pixter. He is very gentle with it and it
  can keep him entertained for hours. Compared to the LeapFrog
  Leapster, Pixter has many more creativity-based activities and
  Leapster tends to be more of an arcade-style system. However, the
  Leapster cartridges are much easier to find and there is a bigger
  selection of titles. I plan to purchase the Leapster for my son
  for his 3rd birthday because the L-MAX can play games on the TV
  as well as on the handheld. Also, contrary to popular belief, the
  Pixter is NOT being discontinued as of this writing. I spoke with
  a representative at Fisher Price myself and she said that they
  are redesigning the system with new colors but not discontinuing
  it or any of the software. Beware when purchasing these games on
  eBay for ridiculous prices from people claiming they are
  discontinued. Wait for the stores to restock after the holidays
  and it will be a different story</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">We have this up on the wall for our
  baby and use it as a diaper changing night light. The luminosity
  is just right for changing baby but is not too blinding for
  sleepy eyes. My 9-year daughter also loves to cycle through the
  phases before bedtime. The room has to be very bright for the
  night light to turn off automatically. The remote is very handy
  and we liked the 3 viewing options. We'll be getting this as
  gifts for our friends and their babies.</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">This is the first RC (radio control)
  aircraft I have ever flown, although I have raced RC cars for
  quite awhile. It comes fully assembled with a nice manual and
  even a quick intro DVD to get you in the air quickly. I started
  out in my living room and it has worked just great. With just a
  little trimming out the heli is very stable and easy for which to
  get a feel. I've run it for a few hours now with no incidents and
  I'm getting pretty good at hovering although I still have a tough
  time with head-in flight (controls thus reversed). The Blade CX
  RTF makes a great first heli or just a great indoor heli.
  Probably fine for anyone over 10 years old. I am getting 10-15
  minutes of flight time on a battery charge. The only
  disappointment is that charging a battery takes 60-90 minutes
  (typical with all LiPo batteries). I'd recommend getting an extra
  battery or two and maybe even an extra powersupply and charger.
  Also I have tried the Training Gear add-on for the Blade CP/CP
  Pro -- it fits the CX just fine and allows you to use it later if
  you move on -- and it helps with damage but makes the Blade CX
  slightly less stable in hover in my opinion but not terribly so.
  They're probably worth the trade off at first. In a few more
  hours I think I'll be ready to move up to the Blade CP Pro.
  Highly recommended for anyone interested in entering RC
  helicopters or who just wants a heli to fly around the house. Two
  good sites for further info are [...]</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">We have the original

  others work at it too. The pieces are small so should be kept
  away from little kids but age 10 and up seem to enjoy it. It's a

  !!!!!! THESE PETS, THE TURTLES, ARE THE BEST! I GOT THEM AND
  PLAYED WITH THEM FOR ALONG TIME!!!!!! I WISH I HAD EVERY ON OF
  THEM!!!!! AND IF I COULD, I WOULD RATE THIS A BILLION
  STARS!!!!!!! I RECCOMEND THIS TO ANYONE WHO LOVES BUT CAN'T HAVE
  REAL PETS, CAUSE THEY WOULD REALLY LOVE THESE "LITTLEST
  PETS!!!</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">We just got this for my daughter's
  5th Birthday. This toy was what received the greatest excitement.
  While opening presents, my daughter exclaimed at the the top of
  her lungs, "I got a Brietta Pegasus!" The pegasus itself is
  durable, beautiful, and creatively sparks hours of imaginitave
  play. I didn't think it was a big deal trying to get it out of
  the box. Many toys are packaged that way these days... Perhaps an
  anti-theft plan. I just got some scissors and Brietta was out to
  play. So far we also haven't had any trouble with the wings. If
  they do fall out occasionally- they pop right back in. A small
  price to pay for such a well-loved toy that my 5 year old plays
  with for hours. As a mom who also loved unicorns and Pegasus
  ponies as a girl, I'm glad I can give that magic to my own
  girls</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">THIS TOY IS GREAT FOR MANY REASONS!!
  Tengamo are collectible gaming magnets with funny characters. You
  get 6 in a pack and really cool stickers! Each character has
  point value and rarity. If you're lucky, you might get one of the
  very rare Tengamos and sell it for $$$$ on Ebay! You can also
  play hundreds of games with the Tengamo magnet special design and
  little steel ball that comes in the pack. Hurry to collect all of
  Series 1 before it is "retired" for Series 2. HIGHLY
  RECOMMENDED</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">I went online to look for other
  Little Tikes toys with the handle and saw that this truck - which
  my 17-month old son loves - only had two stars and I wondered
  why. I disagree with most of the other reviews. The handle on top
  makes it easy for him to push around and carry - he can run it up
  slopes, on the ground, anywhere. He has never fallen or injured
  himself on it. In fact his frustration occurs because he can only
  pull the dump truck end up about 50% of the time. Usually he just
  hands it to me, and points that he wants it open. I do agree that
  the handle does make it difficult to put large items in the back
  and that the opening at the end of the dump truck makes it
  difficult for items to fall out. This is the only reason I'm not
  giving this toy five stars. But my son loves this truck and has
  pretty much been playing with it constantly since we got it about
  a month ago. I'm planning to get him the train with the handle
  because he likes this toy so much.</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">We stretched it across our pool but
  we have a stoper in the line so you fall in the pool. we just
  used some special clamps and a high compression spring. The kids
  love it because they can fly right into the pool</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">It's cute, well packaged and easy
  (but time consuming) to put together. For the price it can't be
  beat. Too bad there's no photo. She'll use it for a while and
  we'll sell it online when we are done and probably get most of
  our money back</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">This is the perfect size swimming
  pool for my 21 month old. She loves this pool. I love the fact
  that only the top ring has to be blown up then once you start
  filling it with water - it stands up. Less risk of tears or
  holes! The only thing I would recommend would be some sort of
  cover for it since it does not come with one</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">My daughter got this pool for her
  first birthday and she loves it. This pool is big enough that I
  can just get in with her and we have a blast. Because of her age
  I don't fill it up all the way and it still works just fine. (it
  just looks a little funny) I found it really easy to set up and
  easy enough to pack away. I was a little confused at first when
  folding it up but within moments I had it put away and every time
  I use it I find it easier and easier. This pool is great for
  traveling to Grandma's house too! I would recommend this to
  anyone young and old</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">I was pleasantly surprised at the
  quality and size of the pool. The price is quite reasonable, and
  I was not expecting such a great deal</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">I liked the pool for this very hot
  summer that we have had; I would recommend a cover for it</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">These Weebles are bigger then the
  ones that come with the box sets</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">T.J. is a great learning tool for
  children. All the stories have been wonderful lessons for
  children as well as helping them to read</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">When my 3-month old nephew received
  this for Christmas, my 15-month old and 3-year old immediately
  started fighting over it. They played with it so much that we
  decided to buy our own, even though I thought they might be too
  old for it. Two months later, it is still the hottest toy in our
  house. The shapes are vibrant colors, rattle, and have rounded
  edges, making them easier than most shape sorters for younger
  children. The top and bottom pieces screw off to remove the
  shapes, and my 3-year old can take them on and off herself. My
  kids also like to lay the top and bottom pieces on the floor and
  set the shapes on them like it is a puzzle. They also like to
  play "catch" by rolling the sorter back and forth to each other.
  I would say this is one of the best toys you can buy for a 6-18
  month old</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">I wanted my daughter to be able to
  listen to music without headphones. This product, the FP3
  Speakers, was perfect. She loves to walk around from room to room
  singing her favorite songs and carrying this around. It is easy
  to turn on and very kid friendly. The only downfall is that the
  price dropped right after I purchased it!</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">My son received this when he was 15
  months old and has never stopped playing with it regularly. He
  loves putting things in the back and zooming around the living
  room. Great buy</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">Very pretty game and fun; but for
  OLDER children. This game has way too many cards to be played
  properly for my [..]. This is going to stay on the shelf until
  she can play with all the cards</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">What a great game! My 4 year old
  loves the disney princess. It is such a great educational toy. We
  love it</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">This game is make-involve, make-think
  and fun. Side effects leave you much smarter. Its fun game for
  parties driving everyone to involvement and fun. Art of asking
  questions and elimination gets better and better just by playing
  this game !!!!!. Strongly recommended for parents who want their
  kids to spend time on creative and learning game, yet fun. They
  can be be part of game and share there thoughts. Though it
  recommends age 10+ might as well be good for 7+ to 100+ ..." I
  wish I had this game little earlier, never stop telling how much
  its fun and good for personality development!!</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">This is a game that will help you
  practice, while you are having fun, to ask the right questions,
  to zero in on the answer and at the same time keeping tab of the
  progress. I believe it is the right questions that you ask that
  help you succeed in a game or in life.This is a game with a
  educational value that will enhance your creative thinking with a
  dose of fun.If you liked Pictionary you will love
  Questionary.</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">much smaller than i imagined it would
  be, but then again i am not very good with measurements. it is a
  very cute doll and my niece loved it</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">I bought her and veronica too! I love
  to them!!I play Archie and date them..they are my fun girls!! My
  wife likes them too</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">SHE'S A BEAUTIFUL DOLL. I LOVE THE
  BLONDE PONYTAIL AND THE MAKE-UP IS FINE. I EVEN LIKE THE JEANS.
  BUT WHY THE UGLY WHITE UNTUCKED SHIRT AND THE SUPER-SHORT PINK
  SWEATER??? IT JUST LOOKS TAKCY TO ME. IF I BUY HER SHE WILL BE
  WEARING A NEW SHIRT RIGHT AWAY. OTHER THAN THAT SHE'S A LOVELY
  DOLL. AND I, LIKE THE PREVIOUS REVIEWER, ALSO REMEMBER AND LOVE
  THE ARCHIE COMICS FROM MY CHILDHOOD. A 5 STAR DOLL EXCEPT FOR THE
  SHIRT</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">I have loved reading Archie comics
  since I was in high school. I was thrilled to find the Archie
  dolls for sale. Thanks</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">This is absolutely adorable. Not only
  is it a great jack in the box for a boy or a girl but you can
  also play peek a boo with the monkey. My daughter is 20 months
  old and she loves it!!!</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">We purchased this set for my son
  Christmas 2003. He loves it. The age range on the listing is off,
  though. It should be the same for any of the Little People toys -
  12 or 18 months and up. There are no small parts. Highly
  recommended and fun during the holidays or any time</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">This was the webkinz my daughter
  wanted, and she's been very happy with it. There was a delivery
  problem, but the seller from whom I bought it was a pleasure to
  deal wit</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">We bought two sets of the Alphabet
  Foam Play Mats - so glad we did! We have a concrete basement
  floor, and now the kids have a nice, colorful, and soft place to
  play. Plus, the foam floor isn't as cold as the concrete - wer're
  in Colorado. The colors are great - so inviting. The pieces fit
  together perfectly, and the border gives it a finished look.
  Great purchase! We'll probably buy more so that we can increase
  the size of the play area!</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">He loves the Dog. I has very happy to
  find him. Since Toy Story was out 10 years ago I did not thing i
  would ever find Slink my Grandsons favorite</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">Along this is not the most
  exhilirating toy. However, my son has collected many of the Toy
  Story Toys and enjoys playing with all of them together. For any
  child who does this you need to have Slinky Do</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">I added this toy to my son's xmas
  list. With much luck he did get it; and we are pleased ! I would
  not say that it's a "fun to play with" toy but the entertainment
  value still exists. The planets are large enough without being
  overbearing up on the ceiling. They glow at night..which is the
  best part !! At 36 years old I can't wait for nighttime to hang
  in my sons room to check out the planets! The stars the set comes
  with are perfect. They are NOT the bulky plastic ones that can be
  seen day or night. They are paper stickers that disappear during
  the day (on the celing they do anyway) The planets come with name
  stickers which adds educational value. My son is five and LOVES,
  LOVES, LOVES these planets. I say get 'em !! Lisa

  <Text category="toys_games">My nephew who is 3 years old got My
  First LeapPad not to long ago and he loves it. He loves train so
  he got one that is Thomas the train and he playes it the morning
  when he get up and at night before he goes to sleep. There are
  many different types, and they are everywhere you just have to
  know where to look. For instance [...] Over all I think this is
  an amazing learning toy for toddler and young kids who look
  forward to reading and writting.</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">I really like My first leap pad and
  so does my 3 year old son. I bought it for him for Christmas last
  year (he was 2 1/2 then)and though some the activities we're
  alittle hard for him to start with, there were still plenty of
  things he could do with it.Every picture you touch the pen on
  says a frase/says the name of the object or make a sound,so even
  without playing the games he still had great fun with it. A year
  on,he can now play all the games on it and has recently noticed
  letters make words,so now he touches the words and the leap pad
  reads it for him,so he is still learning from this toy after a
  year! I will be buying more my first leap pad books for him this
  Christmas,this toy is worth every penny</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">Got this as a gift and it was one of
  the first things she "played" with, well more like laid and
  stared at. Now she's 4 1/2 months old and she still loves it. She
  loves to grab at the fish, shake the rattle and twirl the
  lobster. For awhile, it was a whole new toy every week because
  she would notice something new on it. Great for putting her down
  and keeping her entertained while mom grabs a bite to eat. Also
  good to take places because of the hard plastic bottom. Music
  isn't too annoying either</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">great poseability and a fun
  transformation. the super robot mode helmet is a little goofy
  looking when it's on but other than that he's fantasti</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">thease dolls are ok i agree with the
  other reviewer that the third edtion is wayyyyyyyy better roxxi
  is kinda ugly lol phope is nic</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">My 22-month-old has loved this toy
  for almost a year. The shapes are attractively colored and very
  pleasing to hold, and the attached hammer never gets lost! All in
  all, a very nice version of a timeless toy</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">My 5 and 7 year-old granddaughters
  love Baby Alive. This doll held their attention even to the
  exclusion of the other stuff they "really wanted" for Christmas.
  And the doll is adorable! Even the adults were fascinated. Fun
  and educational</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">I've enjoyed playing this game with
  people from around the world- it seems to work best with a group
  of people who haven't been hanging out together since childhood.
  It gets people talking and makes for an evening of all sorts of
  interesting stories- and you get to find out what interesting
  people your friends are</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">This is perfect for any Kurt
  Cobain/Nirvana fan. It looks great, definitely reminiscent of the
  Smells Like Teen Spirit music video. I bought it as a gift but
  almost kept it for myself! If you are thinking of getting it, I
  would recommend you do so. You won't be disappointed</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">This is a very pretty doll. I waited
  until this year to buy her and got her for only fifteen dollars.
  In my opinion that is the only way to buy these fancy dolls--ON
  SALE! Otherwise they are just too darn expensive. I give this
  particular doll 4 stars. She has a pretty face and I like her
  hair. I think the dress is a bit overdone but that is just me. I
  have very simple tatstes</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">I bought the African-American 2005
  Holiday Barbie for my little girl. I agree with her statement
  that "She's too pretty to play with!!". Mattel did an amazing job
  this year. The face on this doll is EXQUISITE. "Miss 2005" is
  absolutely proportionate in classic Barbie terms. The gown's
  colors definitely put you in a festive spirit. In fact, the ball
  gown, as a whole, is supernaturally beautiful. Picking Bob Mackie
  as this year's designer was nothing short of GENIUS. When I saw
  that Mackie was the HOLIDAY designer, I knew that Mattel had
  finally gotten it right!</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">this is a great toy, i play with it
  all the time and it still works</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">Really nice toy. But I don't
  understand why there are only 3 knobs on the grill but there are
  4 burners...I think this might confuse some of our future fast
  food employees....</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">I remember playing this game as a
  kid. Im sure glad someone still makes it. Good family fu</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">I don't have the tin version but an
  earlier version. The cards look different but the game is played
  the same. I have been playing this with my now current 10 year
  old for 2 years and we both love it. A little luck, some
  strategy, and a whole lot of fun. Don't let the age levels fool
  you-adults will enjoy this as well. A classic that will never go
  out of style</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">My 4 1/2 year old recieved this red
  engine last Christmas, and for the first couple of months was
  used practically every day. (And yes, I agree with the rest of
  the reviewers- buy rechargable batteries since this engine eats
  them, and prepare to be disappointed since it cannot pull many
  cars up the hills without getting stuck.) I will tell you that I
  cannot BELIEVE my son has not touched this engine since. His
  complaint is that all it does is go around and around. Instead,
  he enjoys playing out stories from Thomas, or making up his own
  train sagas. My husband likes to watch the engine more than my
  son. I don't know how other children play with their trains, but
  the battery operated engines just cannot hold his attention for
  very long. Nevertheless, for the first few months, watching it is
  really mesmerizing, I could watch it for hours. Perhaps instead
  of buying this one engine, purchase a setup with more cars and
  track for the same money. It will probably get more use in the
  end</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">Why people purchase a toy for tikes
  when it is specifically targeted at older kids is beyond me.
  Always look at the box for the minimum age a toy is best for.
  That said, all LTTO taggers, including this one, have a simple
  "grab and go" game called LTAG. All you have to do is pull the
  trigger twice and you're on your way. This is early in the
  manual, way before all the complicated games that frustrate 6
  year olds and their parents. I love LTTO. I even run a club that
  uses it here in Auburn, WA. But I *always* start new players out
  with LTAG, then move up to hosted games, and then to the more
  complicated games. Never try to start out by hosting a team Hide
  and Seek game, 'cus it's just too much for a young or completely
  new player. But that's why the LTAG game exists! Just grab it and
  play! No messing with the control panel. Don't take a low rating
  based on an inapproprate purchase as worth much. Similarly, take
  my rating with a grain of salt since I'm a huge fan. But for kids
  8 and up to adults, LTTO taggers are a wonderful, durable, and
  long lived toy that gets you moving AND thinking</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">This was a christmas gift, however I
  can rate it on the base that I own one just like it. This is good
  for a lifetime of fun</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">This is a challenging game, even for
  adults. It's great for getting both sides of your brain going.
  Questions range from easy to difficult and topics cover pop
  culture, history, and science. Great game to play with
  teams</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">We had a blast making up our on
  questions and playing this game. The guys played it and the guys
  never want to play games</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">It would be easier to keep score on a
  book that is not glossy or bound; ink smears, pencil does not
  show up, and writing in the crease is difficult. They should
  include a score book similar to the typical baseball scoring
  books; spiral bound, paper. Other than that, the product is
  exactly what we were looking for.</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">My 4.5 year old loves this! Awesome
  way for young kids to learn God's word! I wish there were more.
  My daughter hasn't put it down since we bought it</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">I purchased this card game as a spur
  of the moment christmas gift for my son who loves monopoly but
  can get no one to play the board game because of how long the
  board game version takes. My son as well as the rest of the
  family was wonderfully surprised to find this monopoly card game
  addictive and fun to play. Each of the hands goes quickly and the
  goal of $10000 is very attainable to reach in a fairly short
  period of time. I will have to admit 3 people was a bit more
  challenging and fun than just 2 and we decided it would be easier
  to keep score of the money by using pencil, paper, and a
  calculator. Overall, I highly recommend this version</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">This pack makes this game more fun
  and allows more people. The rules change a little when using it,
  but they are easy to understand and lots of fun. I highly
  recommend getting this pack if you have ever wanted to play with
  more people</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">My 2.5 year old Border Collie just
  loves the tunnel and we train with it a few times per week. Since
  the agility tunnels for dogs are a bit pricey, I decided to try
  this more affordable kid's tunnel instead. It's not as heavy and
  robust as the official agility tunnels, but it has been serving
  me great for just about a year - there's just some minor wearing
  around the rings and small toe nail runs in it - but it's still
  very usable. My ratings would change a bit for kids though -
  probably a 3 for educational and 5 for durability</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">I've read the other reviews...as I
  was skimming the website to order another of these wands. Guess
  you folks had a bad batch of wands, because my son is crazy about
  his. We gave it to him shortly after his 2nd birthday, and it's
  one of his favorite toys! Yes, it is messy...it's a giant bubble
  wand...when was the last time you played bubbles that there
  wasn't a mess? But if you keep it out doors, I don't see the
  problem. My son was able to make bubbles right away (something he
  wasn't able to do with smaller wands since he can't seem to blow
  (he sucks air in instead of out). His father and I played for
  over an hour with this wand...taking turns making the bubbles and
  letting him pop them (and vice versa). I don't know why the other
  folks had some difficulty...but I would highly recommend this toy
  for a 2-3 year old.</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">We wanted to purchase more
  traditional toys for our daughter for christmas 06. We bought a
  lot of M&amp;amp;D toys and this by far was the better of their
  toys. Even though our daughter is still a little young to put
  pieces together properly it will be even better when she figures
  this out. Like other said the sound is very appropriate. I like
  this toy and definitely recommend this to others. The only reason
  I gave it a 4 is colors on blocks could be a bit brighter or more
  colorful</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">My mother-in-law purchased the
  sandbox for my son, who was not quite two at the time. He has
  played with it everday for the last four months straight. I can't
  even hide it from him. He loves filling the sandbox with other
  trucks that he has. This toy keeps him occupied for hours. He has
  so much fun with it that we are using others for his second
  birthday</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">This is a great (and relatively
  cheap) way to expand your Brio starter set. A nice selection of
  straights, curves, and a few switch tracks that really add to the
  interaction / fun. While Brio in general is expensive, this track
  pack represents a pretty good value (v. buying switches, curves,
  straights, etc on their own.... although you'll "need" to do that
  eventually too!). The finish, fit, and quality is great. Worth
  the money considering the play it'll get &amp;amp; it's
  durability</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">Great idea to hang clothes. The
  hangers are not long enough to keep the clothes on. If your child
  is like mine who loves to dress and re-dress dolls, the armoire
  is not big enough if you purchase more then 3 outfits. The price
  is great now. I paid $20. Great item just wish it was a little
  bigger maybe even a drawer.</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">My 3 yo twin boys love this, but one
  station is a little difficult to maneuver, it is very sensitive,
  even for my 6 yo boy. All in all, I would recommend this for all
  those little train lovers!</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">My son loves this game. When moving
  around the tracks, in the one game it can be difficult, the key
  is if you moving up or down, depending on which direction you
  need to go, push the joystick the direction once and let go,
  after that push the joystick the direction the train needs to go.
  I hope this helps. My son will be 3 in less then a month and it
  took him a week to figure out how to move around the tracks. Mom,
  dad and sis had to play before that. The other games are a little
  easier, but I found the games educational and my son loves
  it</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">My child loves this little crib. I
  think the canopy was the winning feature and the rollers. She can
  easily move it without having to carry it to the next room. All
  her dolls fit the crib. We really think it works. It isn't as
  sturdy as a wooden crib, but it hasn't come apart on us</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">I am the Star Wars Fanatic I really
  like this toy! It has firing misiles and stickers to put on the
  vehicle. And, you can open the wings! This is a great toy!</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">if you dont have a obiwan pilot just
  buy a rebel pilot an put it in the ship I did it a I licke it and
  if you have obiwan imagine it change cloth. I thinck this
  starfighter is best only for the colors because for me al jedi
  starfighter are the same and the firing misiles I tacke them out
  because then they get lost</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">This is an awsome ship! Well at least
  Anakins is. My cousin has a green Anakin jedi starfighter and I
  want to get the new Obi-wan Kenobi one that is coming in
  September. The only thing that is not good about it is that there
  is a little opening in the cockpit that Anakin's hand (the Green
  ship comes with an Anakin that has a normal hand and one holding
  a lightsaber) fell through</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">I think that this was a great gift
  and definitely worth the money. I gave this to my 3 1/2 yr old
  niece as a Christmas gift. She loves the Wizard of Oz. She is a
  big fan of dress up clothes and I also have two more nieces that
  roughly the same age so there was an outfit for each of
  them.</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">I bought a set of these Uno cards for
  my 9-year-old grandson, a Nintendo "freak." The first night he
  had them he played three games with whoever was handy, and spent
  an hour alone arranging the cards just so. He took them to bed
  with him. A few days later he dashed into his other grandparent's
  house showing off his fancy deck of Uno cards and insisted that
  they play a game. He even wrote us a Thank You note telling us
  that the cards were the "coolest present I ever got." The rules
  of the game have not changed, just the look of the cards.
  Nintendo characters, in all their bright colors, are the "suits."
  The cards are housed in a metal box, a throwback to the front
  half of the 20th Century. Excellent art work on the cards and on
  the box. The cards and the game are appealing to all ages. I
  enjoyed playing and getting acquainted with the Nintendo
  characters (my grandson explained them all to me). This is a
  great family game and this Nintendo set is a great gift. It helps
  close the "generation gap." I highly recommend this item. Enjoy.
  One last thing: I bought a second deck for another grandson and
  his response was pretty much the same.</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">Now you can add Risk to your libary
  in this handsome bookshelf edition. The game remains a perennial
  favorite, and in this day and age of global conquest you can play
  out your vicarious need to be king of the world without harming
  anyone, atleast not physically. But, be prepared for a few
  bruised egos, especially when combatants start teaming up on
  weaker victims. While the places and names don't exactly match
  today's geographical boundaries, kids can still get some sense of
  the world in which we live, even if the object of the game
  remains to wipe each other out</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">Love this game. With family and/or
  friends it's one of the best card games around. It is easy and
  doesn't require a lot of attention (you can watch movies, talk,
  hang out, etc.) yet keeps your interest. It's also a game people
  of many ages can play because it's not too difficult. A good card
  game for having friends over to play over dinner or while
  watching a ballgame.</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">I found that for the price. this set
  was great! It comes with one Rascus figure, and one shadow
  knight. The catapult is very orginal, and powered by a rubber
  band, I got it to go 3 and a half feet. There were also some
  improvements in the pieces. For example, the flagpole was less
  annoying, the weapons were improved, and the head pieces came on
  and off much smoother. Whether you are starting Lego Castle or
  are an expert builder, this is great set</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">We just got this lego system for our
  3 year old son and he loves it! He doesn't want to put it away or
  out of his sight at any time. The Scoop and Lofty characters are
  easy for him to assemble and we are working on the little
  buildings, but he may not be quite old enough yet to assemble
  them. Overall, this is a great toy for anyone who loves Bob the
  Builder. We can't wait to purchase the other sets to add to the
  fun!! Lego always makes great and challenging toys!</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">Whenever we take this bike to the
  park, boys and men of every description crown around it in awe.
  My son, who is seven and so far not athletic at all, loves the
  recognition, not to mention the nifty spin outs he can perform
  for everyone watching. We just wish it came in an adult
  size</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">It was what I expected and it came in
  time for my grandsons birthday</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">You need to be old enough to look at
  a set of several horse cards and decide which kind of horse show
  a particular hose would do best in and which horse you would get
  the most points for if you had that particular horse compete in a
  dressage show, jumper show, ect. points are added up and who
  evers horse earned the most points wins that horse show and that
  player gets to keep the cards. So I would say ages 8 to 12, but
  younger children could play with help from someone who can read
  and add up numbers. There is a limited amount of rounds in a
  game, since there is a limited number of cards to play for each
  horse show so the game last around 15 minutes or so. I like this
  part a lot, since games like war "Chomp" can go on forever. It
  does take a table top to play the game, I originally purchased
  the game for my daughter thinking she could play it on the bus
  with a friend, but you need to have a surface to lay out some
  cards. I quess you could try to squeeze them onto a larger text
  book laid onto your lap. But it wouldn't be easy.</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">My toddler and all of her friends
  love this play house. It is great, no assembly required</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">I bought this as a Halloween gift for
  my then 3 year old son in 2004. He loved its spooky sounds and
  the neat turns and tricks in the house. He doesn't really use it
  much anymore, but now my 18 month old loves it! He can actually
  follow the whole progression, turning and pulling levers and
  platforms at the right time. This toy has been great for our
  family. It is pretty durable, some pieces are not quite as smooth
  as they once were and the pop out skeleton at the bottom is not
  working anymore, but considering what it has gone through, it has
  performed amazingly well</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">Well, I just think that the little
  beauty on the cover easily sells this product. Can you even
  imagine her tooting? She's too cute! The slick gentleman blowing
  on the whistle like it's a saxophone and he plays in a be-bop
  quartet of fart blowers makes me wonder if he is blowing out both
  ends. This thing is going to sound like a true to life fart...but
  without all the hassle of the smell. One warning...do not use
  this whistle on your key chain as an emergency device. Please use
  a real loud whistle. You wouldn't want to be alone in an empty
  parking garage with some ghoulish thug chasing you and then you
  just start blowing your fart whistle to get someone to come to
  your aid. If I heard farts in an empty parking garage I would
  most likely run the other way. This whistle is for good times
  only.</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">Toby is one of the regulars on the
  Thomas &amp;amp; His Friends TV series, and this little wooden
  tram engine is well-made and durable for those who have the
  wooden railway sets. My only complaint - and this is very minor -
  is that Toby is a bit taller than other wooden Thomas engines,
  meaning that he cannot fit under bridges very well</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">My 7 year old son got this set for
  Christmas last year, and with all the toys we have for our 5
  kids, this K'nex set gets the most use. He built with it every
  day for months, and still builds something new about every week
  with it. He has built about every model in the book and he is
  getting better at building his own ideas. We've gotten a lot of
  the models on video tape, and he loves to show his grandparents
  the new ones. I loved the sea turtle that "walked" across the
  floor, and he builds amusement park rides and puts little people
  in them. This thing keeps him busy for hours at a time, and he's
  getting another tub of them for his birthday. His little brother
  wants one for his birthday this year. The motor is very cool, and
  he figures out how to use it with the models that don't call for
  it. Since Christmas, he has only broken 2 pieces, so I thought
  that was pretty good. Highly recommended</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">If you know the movies inside and
  out, this game is fun for the dedicated fan. I play with my son
  that knows so much more Star Wars trivia than I do but find the
  game enjoyable. The only minor annoyance is when you land on a
  pie question too many times, the DVD portion of the game runs out
  of questions and tells you to use a question from the card deck.
  Not sure why they could not load up more questions on the DVD but
  maybe the game is not intended for a poor old Mom that answers so
  many questions wrong</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">Star Wars Trivial Pursuit Saga
  Edition (2005.) INTRODUCTION: Despite having been around since
  the middle of the seventies, the Star Wars series has never
  declined in its popularity. George Lucas created a science
  fiction phenomenon that has stood the test of time, and then
  some. And needless to say, many games have been based on the
  series - video games, role-playing games, and no shortage of
  board games have been adapted for the Star Wars universe. In
  1998, Star Wars Trivial Pursuit was released. Being a die-hard
  fan of the series, it was by far my favorite (non video game)
  Star Wars game ever. Unfortunately, it outdated fast, due to the
  fact that it didn't cover the prequel trilogy it was immediately
  followed by. But in 2005, seven years and three Star Wars
  episodes later, a new version of the game has hit store shelves!
  Read on for my review of the new version of Star Wars Trivial
  Pursuit. OVERVIEW: Quite honestly, who doesn't know what Trivial
  Pursuit is? Well, for those of you who have been living under a
  rock all your life, here's the concept behind the game. Players
  alternate rolling a die and moving their game token across a
  wheel-shaped board. There are six different-colored spaces. Each
  color represents a different category. The player is then asked a
  question of that category. If he or she gets it right, he or she
  goes again. If he or she misses it, it's the next player's turn.
  At six spots on the board are wedge spaces. The objective of the
  game is to gain a wedge in all six colors and return to the
  central hub of the wheel, and answer a game-winning question.
  Some changes for this edition of the game are, rather obviously,
  the questions and overall game design being Star Wars based, and
  two DVDs, which contain the wedge and game-winning questions. A
  new concept to the game includes a player being able to "steal"
  if another player is unable to answer the wedge question, in the
  last few seconds of time. Essentially, the game play stays play
  to the classic stylings of Trivial Pursuit, but gives it a Star
  Wars overhaul. In other words, this game is exactly what it says
  it is. REVIEW: The original Star Wars Trivial Pursuit was,
  without question, my favorite Star Wars game of all time that
  wasn't a video game. This new version is a MASSIVE improvement
  over the old version. For starters, the new version covers the
  ENTIRE Star Wars film saga. The classic Galactic Civil War
  trilogy (Episodes IV, V and VI) AND the prequel Clone Wars
  trilogy (Episodes I, II, and III) all get equal emphasis. If you
  hated the original version for not covering the prequel trilogy,
  that problem has, obviously, been corrected, and in a major way.
  The DVDs also add a nice new twist to the game. It's good to
  finally have a method of setting the wedge questions apart from
  regular questions. And, of course, you can do anywhere from two
  to four players or teams. I do have a few minor complaints,
  though. First of all is the selection of the tokens of characters
  you can play as. The original version had Luke Skywalker,
  Princess Leia, Han Solo, and Darth Vader. In other words, a nice
  assortment of main characters. The new version has Luke
  Skywalker, Darth Vader, Obi-Wan Kenobi, and Yoda. In other words,
  ONLY JEDI CHARACTERS. This is strictly a cosmetic flaw, but
  still, I think they could have picked a better assortment of
  characters than those four. Another complaint is the inclusion of
  a die. For those of you who never played the original version of
  the game, it included an electronic R2D2 figurine which would
  tell you how many spaces to move when you tapped its head, via an
  LCD screen. I liked that better than rolling a die because it
  helped to give the game a unique Star Wars feel that playing with
  a die just doesn't have. Another problem is the price of the game
  - I've seen it everywhere from $45 to $60! Even at the lowest
  MSRP, it's still a rip off. One of the biggest problems is one of
  the most obvious - if you're not a die-hard Star Wars fan, you
  will not get very far in this game. My last and biggest complaint
  is with the questions themselves - like the original game, they
  are HORRIBLY imbalanced. Some questions are so simple, a casual
  fan could answer them easily. Some are so difficult, even
  die-hards will have trouble with them. This brings me to my
  complaint about the DVD questions. Not only are these questions
  really no more difficult than the card questions, but as time
  ticks down, the questions become EASIER! This makes it
  ridiculously easy for another player to "steal" the wedge if the
  question receiver is unable to answer. If I were designing the
  game, I'd straighten up these flaws. But I'm not, and overall, I
  am very satisfied with it. EDITION NOTES: This game is a fairly
  recent release, and it remains readily available at most major
  stores that sell board-style games and movie merchandise. If you
  want the game, it shouldn't be too hard - just be ready to pay a
  fairly high price for it. OVERALL: Despite some minor issues,
  this new version of Star Wars Trivial Pursuit is a
  leaps-and-bounds improvement over the original game. If you're a
  huge fan of the series who thinks your knowledge of the series is
  supreme, don't hesitate to buy this game. There have been many
  Star Wars trivia games/books/etc. over the years, but Star Wars
  Trivial Pursuit is the ultimate Star Wars trivia experience. No
  fan should pass this game up</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">I like the language tutor and the
  music stuff! I also like the screen savers! It's given me great
  ideas! I play with it in a different way than you are supposed
  to. Like if I need a story starter I go to the "Magic Act" and
  read the sentences for an idea</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">Our family loves this game and has
  played it for years. The tiles on this version are smaller than
  the original and some might find them difficult to handle. If you
  like Scrabble, you will love this game!</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">Even better than Scrabble, you build
  words on the board AND build words "up" by adding letters over
  existing words. So "tree" becomes "free" and "braces" becomes
  "blades". The scoring might be a little too easy, but if you're
  hard core, you can use the point values from Scrabble to raise
  the score difficulty. The board is small so you have to start
  thinking up instead of out fairly soon into the game, and the
  game doesn't drag on for too long. It is addictive and you will
  not look at words the same way again.</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">My daughter (age 13) really enjoyed
  this game. It provides more options than scrabble, which
  sometimes frustrates her because her Mom and Dad are better at
  that.</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">It's soo cute and cuddly! Not only is
  extra soft, it's small enough to fit in your palm or make a great
  addition to a desk. It looks realistic too, it had the little cat
  fur covering its eyes making it even more adorable, the only
  downside if you trying cuddling with it to go to sleep make sure
  you take out the "TY" tag otherwise you would end up with heart
  shape marks on your face=</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">This game is awesome! It is addictive
  though so be prepared. A little complicated once you get started,
  but becomes easier. Best if someone already knows the game to
  teach it. Really fun though</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">I definitely can tell when a great
  game show can be fun as a board game. Unfortunately, that
  absolutely isn't always the case. One of my all time favorite
  quiz shows back in the 80's was Super Password with Bert Convy.
  The game of course showcases a celebrity and a regular contestant
  trying to guess their way to guess a mystery word for a puzzle.
  This edition doesn't reflect on that edition. This board game
  edition is a example of the original Password with the late Allen
  Ludden. The game is still fun and enjoyable for those who
  actually haven't seen the original Password like myself, but it
  is just delightful. Unfortunately, it isn't much fun reflecting
  on this version and relating to the Bert Convy edition.
  Hopefully, when Password is remade, it will be just like the
  themed 80's edition of the NBC game show. Price: B- Game: C 1/2+
  Fun &amp;amp; Enjoyment: B- Overall: C</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">This is a great game! Using clues to
  get others to say the secret word. Another great classic game
  brought back by Endless! A++</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">I purchased this for my daughter a
  bit before Christmas and she loves it. It is a great item for the
  price and does what the bigger brand names does. Thank you</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">This is a very good Webkinz as the
  plush and as the virtual pet. It comes with a rare TV and other
  supplies. it is also very soft. The only bad thing is the price.
  Don't buy Webkinz online, the price can go up to $50. The real
  Price is $11.99, which you can find them for that price in
  stores</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">sure this doesn't make the popular
  clanking sound going down the stairs as the metal originals, but
  it still works well, and has been copied by many companies. I
  even have one with a business name on it. These fun, functional,
  and keep a kids imagination engaged. No noise or batteries
  needed. Buy someone you know this for a stocking stuffer this
  year</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">My 9 month-old granddaughter likes
  her Christmas present of Octotune; as a matter of fact, we played
  with this toy yesterday when I stayed with her. It is colorful,
  she can grab the legs and the music is pleasing, so it stimulates
  more than one sense.</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">I bought this for my year old
  grandaughter and am more than pleased. It is very heavy so as the
  child stands up to play it does not move at all. The corners are
  rounded so there are no sharp points for the child to hurt
  themselves on. It will hold their attention for quite a while as
  there are five activities for them to play with. The price was
  very reasonable compaed to other similar products.</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">I bought this set for my grandsons
  2nd birthday. My son found it very easy to assemble and my
  daughter in law loves it because it is a lovely piece of
  furniture. My grandson loves to sit at the table and look at
  books or build with blocks. This is a sturdy set that will last
  for many years</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">I love Melissa and Doug toys, they're
  always well-made and always thoughtful. They encourage learning
  and their pieces, made of natural material, not only hold up well
  but are environmentally friendly. This game is a particularly
  nice example. It's a classic wooden puzzle with a twist. Each
  vehicle puzzle piece has a magnet on it and the players yank them
  out with a magnetic "tow truck". Melissa and Doug have made two
  other puzzles similar to this, a fish puzzle and a butterfly
  puzzle, with the same concept. This one, however, might appeal
  more to kids whose current fascinations lie more along the lines
  of cars and trucks. One of our pieces (on the fishing version of
  this puzzle) did stick, but a quick rub around the edges with
  some sandpaper loosened it right up. The downside of using real
  materials is that wood does have a tendency to warp in humidity
  or dryness. That's a downside I'm willing to live with! Excellent
  toy!</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">I can't believe how well made this
  set is. I have been looking for good quality kitchen toys for my
  daughter for Christmas. I wanted something sturdy and not
  plastic. I just received my order today and these items are
  great! My son opened the box and tested them for his little
  sister and he can't wait to play with them with her. I ordered
  this set and the baking set and both are made out of solid wood
  and are extremely durable. I am very impressed and wish amazon
  carried the matching coffee pot and blender! I also had a problem
  with the velcro on the butter. It was an easy fix with some super
  glue. I think the heat during the shipping made the velcro come
  off</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">This was a gift to my Grand Sons (10
  &amp;amp; 7). They were well pleased with it. The 10 year old has
  joined a Chess Club after school.</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">This product was delivered
  fast.......It was so easy to install.......and the light is a
  pretty blue just like the picture. When the light is on it does
  not show up as well</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">If you are a hardcore Family Guy fan
  like me (I am actually one of the few people that watched Family
  Guy when it was originally on the air), you will not be
  disappointed with this Monopoly version. The box is beautifully
  designed with the Griffin family pictured on center, and some
  easter eggs to look around for. The board is not the most
  impressive one especially compared to The Simpson's and Muppets
  Monopoly versions but it is pretty nice with the Griffins at
  center. What you will love of the board is the properties, which
  include everything from Chris' Closet and Seamus' Lighthouse to
  James Woods High and Geronimo's Palace to The Clam and Channel 5
  News to Mayor West's Mansion and finally Petoria, all from both
  old and new seasons plus some scenes from the Stewie's Untold
  Story movie. The property deeds are somewhat disappointing
  though. The do not have color watermarks like those found in the
  Simpson's version, but I guess they will do. Peter's Fishing
  Boat, Hinden-Peter, Peter-Copter and the Pope Mobile replace the
  Railroads. I bet you will not be laughing too much when you have
  to pay $200.00 (Income Tax) for Volcano Insurance or $75.00 for
  Workplace Sensitivity Training (Luxury Tax) but hey, you can't
  stay mad for long at the Salesman Guy, right? It would have been
  cool to have Joe Swanson on the Go To Jail space and have a
  picture of Quahog Prison on the jail space but well, what can you
  do? The Pewter Tokens are nice. You can chose from TV Junkie
  Peter, Mug in hand Brian, Nose picking Chris, Lois, Stewie in a
  high chair and Meg (who looks like a Peanut character). You can
  also order four more tokens that include The Giant Chicken,
  Quagmire, Joe and the Evil Monkey. The coolest changes are the
  Chance and Community Chest cards that are replaced by the What
  the Deuce! and Giggity! Giggity! Giggity! cards, respectively.
  They are beautifully done in full color and you will find things
  like; Made Sheriff of Bumblescum ADVANCE TO GO, Get Liposuction
  and Implants Pay $100, Confederate Civil War Veterans are After
  You Go Back 3 Spaces, Take Big Fat Paulie to The Movies as a
  Favor Collect $25.00, Help Death get a Girlfriend Collect $100,
  and many more. The money goes as follows $1 - Meg, $5 - Chris $10
  - Lois, $20 - Brian, $50 - Stewie, $100 - Peter, $500 - The
  Griffins There are no special rules for this version, which is
  weird since it has been the norm for some time in these special
  Monopoly versions. To wrap it up I must say that even though they
  could have done a better job this is a beautiful and wonderfully
  done Monopoly game. Family Guy fans will love it making this a
  great gift. HAVE FUN</Text>

  <Text category="toys_games">The build a figure (BAF) program of
  Marvel legends keeps on rocking. This time build a giant 14"
  Apocalypse. This BAF is big and cool, super articulated, with
  sculpt and paint fine enough to be a sculpture. For Apocalypse 5
  stars. For Iron Fist... Well he's super articulated and does come
  with the mighty booty (that's the buttocks) of Apocalypse, but
  really is the weakest figure in this series. A lot of that is
  just charater design though. Green tights with an open v-neck
  green shirt, and what is that tattoo supposed to be anyway,
  ballet slippers and a dew-rag? Pretty horrible looking. If you
  can, try to find the red suit variant, at least that's a little
  cool. Also, the accesories (besides the booty) are two rubbery
  flames to fit into his hands to give a fire fist effect. Good
  luck with that. They are kind of flimsy and hard to place in the
  hands. Once you get them in you better not touch the figure again
  or they will fall off. Overall, not the quatlity of figure or
  accesories I'd expect. But the rest of the figures in the series
  will make up for this one, plus you do still get that
  booty</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">we received this for my daughter's
  4th birthday. it has been a lot of fun to play--simple enough for
  her to play, and hard enough to grow with her for the past year.
  although it has a lot of pieces, they have remained durable and
  have withstood tiny fingers.</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">My daughter received this for her 5th
  birthday and she absolutely loves it. It combines the classic
  board and memory games together. The pieces are made of very
  thick cardboard and are very durable. The only small complaint is
  the spinner which tends to get stuck easily. We have played this
  game multiple times each day since received and she is still
  excited everytime we open the box. An excellent game!!</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">Well, I got this ahwile ago I got
  this toy and I was very excited. I made the blanket but it was a
  hassel. The glue didn't work, and the instuctions are a bit

  <Text category="toys_games">My 8 year old son LOVES this toy. He
  has spent many hours acting out the cartoon and loves that fact
  that the cape pops out at the push of a button and winds back in
  by moving a leg back and forth. He likes the food dish that
  shoots the disc. and also thinks the cryptonite is cool!!! It
  says it changes colors when warm, but we havent seen that. Maybe
  nn to run it under hot/cold water?! Overall a fantastic
  buy</Text>

  <Text category="toys_games">it is fun to play with and kind of

  <Text category="toys_games">My daughter absolutely loves Rarity.
  It is the perfect size and goes everywhere with us. The bright
  colorful hair is fun to play with</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">This play tent is great - my son got
  it when he was 1 and still loves it a year later. He brings toys
  in there and "hides" to play. It is not unsafe, it will tip over
  at times, but it's so lightweight that it could not hurt him. I
  think that it's a great buy for the money and would recommend
  it</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">My 3 1/2 year old son has older
  sisters with iPods and always wants to use them to listen to. We
  bought this for him for Christmas and he calls it his iPod and he
  absolutely loves it. We download new songs and stories from time
  to time as a reward. We also bought the speakers for him to
  listen to stories or songs while going to sleep or just hanging
  out at home. It's tough and durable and withstands being dropped
  and rough handling like a 3 year old dips out</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">I got this for my 6 year old son with
  moderate autism. what a god-send! he uses it every day, for
  several hours. i bought the speaker accessory so he doesn't have
  to use the head phones all the time. it is so easy to change the
  song list. he is able to use it independently, except for pushing
  the song vs. story button. the icons and ability to customize the
  icons have made it so he can quickly search for what he wants. i
  found the drawing screen for the icons challenging at first- but
  even me with my lack of artistic talent was able to accomplish
  the task so he knows them. i would give this my highest
  recommendation- very tough player- dropped who knows how many
  times- yet keeps going. the best thing i've purchased for him in
  a very long time. well worth the money.</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">It is an okay seat. My only complaint
  is that my son has slightly chubby legs and the area on the chair
  where his legs go and the whole "pummel" thing seem kind of tight
  and uncomfortable for him. We started him in it at about 4
  months. He sits in it for only short periods of time, he gets
  uncomfortable pretty fast. Otherwise, a decent chair</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">I'll start off by saying that THIS is
  the company to buy Naruto headbands from. It is high quality
  fabric that is very comfortable on the skin and the length will
  fit around anyone's head (trust me, I have a pretty big head).
  The insignia plate is made out of real metal and is engraved
  superbly. A velcro padding on the back ensures that the plate
  doesn't touch your forehead and cause discomfort. In other words,
  this headband is like it was plucked out of the show itself, and
  for the price, it is a very nice addition to any Naruto fan's
  wardrobe</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">I got this for my 3 year old niece.
  She loves it and requests that it go with her all the time. The
  box to hold all the pieces is handy, the magnets are easy and
  there's lots of variations of outfits. Having 2 dolls makes it
  easy for friends, parents etc to play along and interact. The
  only cons I see is that the box with all the pieces is a bit
  heavy, it could use a handle. And the magnets are strong but
  sometimes the pieces slip a bit. All in all, a great gift and
  toy!</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">My 3 year old daughter has this dress
  up set and it is great for little hands that are not coordinated
  enough yet to dress and undress actual Barbi dolls. She loves
  changing their outfits and switching their accessories - and I
  love that she can do this without any frustration. Mellissa and
  Doug toys are made with the quality of older toys - they are well
  constructed and made to last - and the sturdy box allows for easy
  clean up and storage.</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">It is a little smaller than I
  expected...But I guess i shoulda wrote down the measurements and
  took a tape measure in the room before hand. Other than that,
  It's perfect. My son's room has an Atlanta Braves theme so the
  colors are perfect. The main reason I bought this was to use as a
  toy box. So far, it's worked out great! I don't have or plan to
  put books on top so the fact that the bookends are small don't
  bother me. The only thing I have sitting on top is a teddy bear
  and a piggy bank.</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">We recently purchased this toy
  storage unit for our 22 month old son and we couldn't be happier.
  It is sturdy and durable..a hard combination to find these days,
  looks great but most of all is very functional and user
  friendly!! It only requires 14 screws to assemble and it looks
  great. Our son can't wait to get up and play, yelling toy box and
  jumping out of bed to grab a bin.I will purchase more of these
  for the different "toy" areas of our home and would certainly
  give it as a gift</Text>

  do all of their friends. They are affordable and sturdy!! I
  recommend them !!!</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">Wingo looks like the real car from
  the movie, drives great, it was a hit with both my boys ages 3
  and 6. The color on the car is bright and just like the one in
  the movie, the back of the car is exactly like the one in the
  movie. My boys were very excited to see it! They play and act out
  the whole cars movie with all their cars</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">I love this toy! I'm 12 years old and
  I still love to play Barbie's! I would reccomend this toy to any
  mother who has a little girl or boy that loves to play
  Barbie's</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">I bought four of these for my
  husabnd, son in law, daughter and myself for Christmas. I wrapped
  a bag of marshmallows for each of them and gave them the wrapped
  guns and marshmallows on Christmas eve. The second they opened
  the marshmallows they knew what was in the box. They ripped into
  them and were shooting each other like crazy. They had a blast! I
  will tell you that the marshmallows do hurt at close range when
  the gun is pumped way up. My dogs loved it too. They ate all the
  marshmallows that fell to the floor. Well, not ALL of them..I did
  find some in the Christmas tree and on the bookshelves. (Yes they
  played with them in the house.) One trick...to get the
  marshmallows to shoot really well, we genlty rolled them in our
  hands from side to side to make the mallow just a bit skinnier.
  Stale marshmallows work great too</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">Ms. Pac Man was always my game back
  in the day. She just seemed less clunky than her male
  predecessor. I just received this game in the mail today and
  after a mad scramble for eight (count 'em EIGHT) AA batteries I
  got down to business. I admit that I bought this game for Ms. Pac
  Man, exclusively. Here's what I found, in a nutshell: Pros: 1)
  Graphics &amp;amp; sound are faithful to the old arcade game with
  the minor exception of the placement of the score, lives and
  fruit. No problem. 2) Old skool joystick. Nice touch. 3) Plug 'n
  play set-up. No brainer. Cons: 1) I honestly don't mind cords one
  bit. The eight batteries can be a bit of a logistical problem as
  I don't usually have a dozen-or-so batteries lying around at any
  given time. 2) My main gripe is that the joystick is
  frustratingly unresponsive and has the habit of moving Ms. Pac in
  directions I don't want her to go. I understand, however, that
  the previous version of this game was worse in this regard and
  has been slightly improved in this version. Fair 'nuff.
  All-in-all a neat little contraption that is every bit as
  addictive as it was in my youth.</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">I bought this toy for my 3 year old
  son before his baby brother was to be born. He absolutely loves
  this doll! I babysit during the day and he took care of his baby
  right along with me while I cared for the baby I keep. He had
  regressed and started wetting his pants again when I began
  babysitting but is now going to the bathroom on his own again
  after getting this doll and having his own baby to care for! The
  yawn as some other reviewers have said does sound a bit weird but
  it IS only a doll! If the baby is not attended to properly to
  make her stop fussing or to put her to sleep then she'll
  eventually just do it on her own so it's not frustrating for my
  son, great for younger kids. My husband did not want our son
  having a "girl" doll and I can't find any clothes to fit the doll
  to turn it into a boy so my only wish is that this doll was also
  made as a boy or at least boy clothes were sold for her.</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">A wonderfully complete set for
  toddlers to set up a complete dinner just like Mommy &amp;amp;
  Daddy. the pieces are easily recognizable and realistic. The
  children enjoy sharing the dinner with their "friends"</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">My 5-year-old adores this addition to
  his moonsand play set. The kit includes enough sand to make cars
  and other items to "run over" with the included Monster Truck. He
  had a ball and still plays with it at least once or so a week
  after a month of me purchasing it. The new inserted play mat for
  the original blow up moonsand kit makes it that more fun for him
  to play like he's at the Monster Trucks show! Great Idea! for a
  new and fun way to make and keep moonsand play sets interesting.
  Yes, moonsand can get messy, but didn't we all learn creatively
  through making messes when we were younger? I'll gladly sweep
  this up when he's done</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">I purchased the 12-Prank Kit for my
  83 year old aunt this past Christmas. On Christmas Morning, as
  everyone opened the usual boring gifts of knit sweaters and
  scented candles, my elderly aunt carefully tore open her Prank
  Kit. It was an instant hit! As she laid out her Fake Dog Poop on
  the floor next to the Christmas tree and blew her new Fart
  Whistle, everyone started to roll with laughter. Oddly enough,
  this inexpensive little gift became the high-point of our family
  Christmas gift-giving. Maybe that sounds pathetic, but my Aunt
  was carried back to younger days when she used to pull pranks
  with whoopie cushions on her little nephews. Thanks to this great
  little package, we all laughed so hard it hurt. What an awesome
  gift</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">tamagothchis are so much fun they are
  really col and there a little hard to care for and its fun
  watching them change they are a great item and worth there

  <Text category="toys_games">I have a videonow player and I luv
  it!!! There are over 100 discs!</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">Both of my kids got these for
  Christmas - great idea; not as expensive as a DVD player for the
  car (especially for those of us who don't want the portable
  one/plan to get next vehicle with built in) and the picture was
  really better than I thought it would be. However, I only got my
  children two discs a piece to start. Now, NO discs worthwhile can
  be found anywhere. The only ones that are ever on the
  racks/online en masse are the Star Wars 3 pack (none of today's
  kids really want that), the Tony Hawk Skate Park (obviously they
  aren't interested there either) and Fear Factor (let's face it,
  if you let your kids watch FF you need to take the VideoNow
  player and hit yourself in the head - HARD).And even if I do find
  a couple on Ebay, the selection is so limited. I wish I'd just
  bought a cheap portable DVD player. Hasbro really missed the boat
  on this one - it could have been a great thing but they didn't
  make enough discs of the ones they do produce and need to put
  more shows out for the kids. My advice: Don't buy it. I am very
  disappointed in the disc selection - this is already at the
  bottom of the toy box.</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">Webkinz Pets are an excellent choice
  for a child who wants to use the internet and a parent who values
  internet safety. The pets are adorable and my children are
  addicted! Fun for parents too!</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">This umbrella can be used with lots
  of other playsets, not just the Little Tikes brand. We use ours
  staked in the ground next to our Step 2 Naturally Playful
  sandbox/wading pool and we take it along and use it with his
  folding plastic chair that has an umbrella hole and clip. Great
  for hot days at the pool, beach or just hanging around in the
  backyard. It comes with a storage/ carry bag that has a carrying
  strap for over-the-shoulder hauling around, too. It has a wind
  vent at the top, but I would still close it at night or take it
  indoors if you have high winds, since it is a petite size and
  weighs less than similar full-size versions sold to adults. Nice
  forest green color and white pole and finial; the fabric is
  heavy-weight and overall the umbrella seems well-made. A great
  buy at this price</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">this toy teaches history and stories
  to improve the imaginations of kids everywhere it and its others
  are a must have</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">I was unable to find this product
  until now and it was great!!! Delivered fast and absolutely no
  problems!!!!</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">My son is 11 and loved this. He was
  very proud when he built it by himself. It is very detailed and
  has movable parts so that you can also play with it (gently of
  course). This is the type of piece that is great all by itself
  without getting all the other pieces in the series. It is also a
  classic piece in that it doesn't have a cartoon or charter
  theme</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">Every time I see my twin daughters
  riding these bikes around I make a promise to write a review of
  the product. Here I am fulfilling my promise. They were able to
  pedal the bike within 2 - 3 days of getting them. They are a
  great size for two year olds plus they fold up so that I can
  carry both in the back of my small car (89 chevy camaro) and are
  light enough that I can carry them by the big handle in the back
  when the girls want to run instead of bike. The only drawback is
  that they are a little unstable on tight turns.</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">My daughter (15 months) literally
  started running in place with excitement when she opened this
  baby doll, which was a gift from my best friend. I've NEVER seen
  her react like this to any gift. My daughter has continued to
  bring this baby doll around with her everywhere--usually she just
  ditches her toys and plays with the tupperware. The doll has a
  soft, squishy body that makes her cuddley despite the fact that
  she has, as my husband is constantly saying, "a hard plastic
  head."</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">My son needed this gun to go with his
  Halloween costume. Needless to say he was thrilled with it. It
  has held up under a lot of use, and the noise is not too loud and
  irritating.</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">My son (5 year old) chose this toy as
  his reward and was so excited when he received it. He and his
  brother and dad enjoy countless hours of pretend play as they are
  all Star Wars fans. It has a realistic appearance and the sound
  is not irritating as are many toy guns. Highly recommended</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">This toy Is awesome, I am a starwars
  fanatic so I'll get anything starwars. But not cheesy like the
  Darth Vader voice changer. Overall this toy is great</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">The X-23 figure availible on
  Amazon.com is dressed in purple but there also is a black one - a
  variant that is alot harder to find [I resorted to eBay for
  mine]. The build of the figure is great - There's so much
  articulation, it's insane; and her feet claws actually tuck under
  her shoes so they can be concealed which is beyond cool. The
  articulation, for the most part, is great. My only qualm with it
  is it makes her arms look funny but I can deal with that. She's
  barely 6 inches tall, I don't expect her to be perfect. However,
  the reason I'm giving her three stars is because I feel the
  purple outfitted one is far inferior to the black outfitted X. I
  recieved my black clad X-23 first and expected the same figure
  but in a purple for my other one but I was wrong. The black X-23
  has very dark brown hair that lays straight and lank while the
  purple X-23's hair is jet black and windblown which makes her
  head almost impossible to move around. Also, the thing that
  bothers me the most is that X's eyes are green on the black
  suited version but on the purple suited version, they're orange.
  I am a big X-23 fan and I understand that when she's "triggered",
  her eyes go crazy reddish orange, but that's not something I
  really want to see sitting on top of my computer monitor. It's
  kind of creepy! And on a sidenote, when did X-23 wear purple? In
  her comics she was either in black, dressed as a civilain or in
  the old Wolverine costume [which you can see in the comic that
  comes with X-23]. I would've prefered a variant wearing the
  Wolverine costume while the black X-23 was mass produced. So,
  personally, I would recommend hunting down the variant of X-23
  for your collection. She looks nicer and, I think, is more true
  to the character</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">I bought this toy for my daughter
  almost a year ago now. She still plays with it all the time. It
  is by far her fav toy. The only problem is that it's a bit too
  load and no way to turn it down, or off. Well, besides that it is
  a perfect toy for small kids. My daughter is almost 4 and still
  is not tired of it</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">The is one of the fastest and easiest
  to learn games I have ever played. The first time we played was
  on Christmas Day. We had 10 players that ranged from 16 years to
  77 years and everyone loved it. We played for over 3 hours and
  decided we had to stop to eat. It is also a great way to break
  the ice. I would recommend this game to anyone whether you are a
  big game player or a beginner, this game can't be beat</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">Okay, we all know about the Disney
  CARS craze and trying to hunt down all the new die-cast
  characters Mattel puts out. These 1:24 scale models are very,
  very nice and the size is perfect for young boys, girls or
  collectors. The only downside is that they only made Mater and
  McQueen. Who wouldn't love to see Chick Hicks or The King in 1:24
  scale?! Come on Mattel! Get with it!! ;</Text>
  <Text category="toys_games">My son has really enjoyed this,
  however, after marks are made with the "washable" markers, it
  actually takes about 3 washings to get the marks out but they do
  come out eventually</Text>
